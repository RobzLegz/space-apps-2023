Permittivity: The ratio of the flux density produced by an electric field in a given dielectric
to the flux density produced by that field in a vacuum.

Petticoat Insulator:  An insulator made in the form 
of superposed inverted cups and used
for high voltage insulation

Plasma: A gaseous body of ions and electrons of sufficiently low density that considerable
charge separation is possible. Note: Because of the 
mobility of charge, a plasma is normally
neutral and free of electric field in its interior, 
just like a metallic conductor.

Polyamide: A polymer in which the structural units are linked by amide or thioamide
groupings.

Polystyrene: A thermoplastic material produced by the polymerization of styrene (vinyl
benzene).
Potting: A process similar to encapsulating, except 
that steps are taken to ensure complete
penetration of all voids in the object before the resin polymerizes.

Power Factor: The ratio of the average (or active) power to the apparent power (rms
voltage times rms current) of an ac circuit. Also known as phase factor.

Pulse: A wave that departs from a first nominal state, attains a second nominal state, and
ultimately returns to the first nominal state.      

Resin: An organic substance of natural or synthetic 
origin characterized by being
polymeric in structure and predominantly amorphous. 
Note: Most resins, though not all, are of
high molecular weight and consist of a long chain or network molecular structure. Usually, resins       
are more soluble in their lower molecular weight forms.

Resistance: The property of a conductor that determines the current produced by a given
difference of potential. Note: The ohm is the SI derived unit of resistance.

Resistivity: The ability of a material to resist passage of electrical current either through its       
bulk or on a surface. Note: The unit of volume resistivity is the ohm-centimeter.

Semiconductor: A solid substance whose electrical conductivity is intermediate between
that of insulators and conductors. The conductivity 
of a semiconductor is often tailored through        
the addition of impurities and is usually dependent 
on applied electric or magnetic fields or by        
temperature effects.

Seta, plural: setae – very small, stiff hair like structures that can form on the surfaces of
materials. If the surface is electrically charged, a seta results in very high electric field
concentration, sometimes leading to electrical breakdown.`; // Replace with the first string you want to compare

e. “Insulation systems” may consist of one or more materials or classes of materials
used to electrically isolate two or more conducting 
surfaces.

f. “Partial discharge” is an electrical discharge that does not bridge the electrodes, such
as internal discharges in the cavities within the solid dielectric, surface discharges along the        
surface of insulator, and corona discharges around a sharp edge (usually around the electrode
surface). Usually, the magnitude of such discharges 
is small; however, they may cause
progressive deterioration of the insulation and lead to ultimate failure.

g. “Pure air”: The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its
components (e.g. CH
4
, CO
2
, H
2
O) so 'pure' air has no precise meaning. The composition of the
major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084;
oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane,
0.00016; krypton, 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087. The
concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons and some
other species of anthropogenic origin are increasing measurably with time. For purposes of this
document, “pure air” is assumed to consist of such a mixture that is free of any contaminant that       
could possibly alter its electrical or dielectric behavior.

For early spacecraft missions, techniques were developed for the detection of partial discharges        
in spacecraft electronic equipment. Use of these techniques clearly showed that the reduction of        
partial discharges enhanced equipment life, and thereafter testing incorporating such techniques        
made mandatory to eliminate faulty insulation and flawed workmanship. Some examples of
representative instrumentation and test techniques, 
both of which have matured and improved
over time, are described later in this NASA Technical Handbook.

In the modern spacecraft electronics industry, dense packaging is required to make the
equipment fit within a restricted volume. Likewise, 
weight is restricted to economize on fuel and       
maximize space for the payload. Consequently, high electrical field stresses, which enhance
partial discharge activity, are often present. Such 
partial discharge activities can be a contributing  
factor in insulation degradation.

Continuous partial discharge or corona activities are a serious problem usually associated with
insulation degradation, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and the upset of poorly protected
sensitive circuits without proper shielding or noise suppression. Insulated conductors may be
highly susceptible to continuous corona or partial discharges when operated at very low pressure        
gaseous environments, because the corona, or breakdown initiation voltage, is a function of both        
the density and content of the gaseous environment. 
For example, helium has a much lower
breakdown voltage at low pressures than air or nitrogen. The insulated and non-insulated
conductors, terminations, and other electrical/electronic parts may be susceptible to this
phenomenon in the high field stresses caused by the 
dense population of parts within the system
design. Some insulation systems, however, can endure partial discharge or corona activities for
microseconds to milliseconds, for thousands of repetitive occurrences, as experienced with pulse        
power applications.`
