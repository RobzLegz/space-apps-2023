Delamination: Separation between layers in laminated glass, compromising its structural or visual properties. Scratches or Abrasions: Visible or tactile marks on the surface which might impede clarity or compromise structural strength.

Discoloration or Hazing: Any change in the visual properties of the glass leading to reduced transparency, including fogging or development of a milky appearance. Bubbles or Inclusions: Presence of air pockets or foreign materials within the glass that were not intended as part of the original design. Seal Failure: Signs of moisture or foreign matter within multi-pane windows, indicating a failure of the sealing system.
