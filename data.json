During system leak check operations following valve repair, water flow from zone 3 (directly over the Orbiter) occurred in OPF Bay 2. The time of first flow was established as 10:28 AM on September 24, 1989, as recorded by OPF Water Pump House instrumentation due to diesel pump startup. The Zone 3 water flow over the Orbiter was at a reduced rate, with only a partial nozzle discharge pattern.Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) Water Systems technicians were cycling the manual arming and firing valves while leak checking the system.

This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off.A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians.The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted.

During system leak check operations following valve repair, water flow from zone 3 (directly over the Orbiter) occurred in OPF Bay 2. The time of first flow was established as 10:28 AM on September 24, 1989, as recorded by OPF Water Pump House instrumentation due to diesel pump startup. The Zone 3 water flow over the Orbiter was at a reduced rate, with only a partial nozzle discharge pattern.Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) Water Systems technicians were cycling the manual arming and firing valves while leak checking the system. Only a few minutes had passed from the time they cracked open (2 turns) the system manual supply valve until they heard about the water flow problem in Bay 2. The SPC Lead Water Systems technician ran into the OPF to see what was wrong and noted the deluge flow. He returned to the manual activation station behind the OPF and found that two SPC ground support equipment (GSE) technicians had opened the manual arming and firing valve to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It is presumed Zone 3 did not flow additional water and had been deactivated by this time.) The Lead Water Systems technician then closed all the open manual arming and firing valves, as well as the manual supply isolation valves to stop all Bay 2 water flow.The scenario that lead to the two GSE technicians being at the deluge system manual flow control valve station is as follows:After the flow from Zone 3 occurred, the SPC OPF Bay 1 Site Division Manager asked a GSE technician to find someone who could turn the system off. This GSE technician, accompanied by a co-worker, proceeded to the manual activation station behind Bay 2. Upon arrival, they proceeded to position the manual arming and firing valves to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the \"on\" position, thinking they were turning the firex system off. This turned on deluge system Zones 1, 2, 4, and 5 (Zone 3 had already been deactivated) to the \"full on\" mode. The Lead Water Systems technician then returned to the manual valve panels, proceeded to turn the manual arming and firing valves to the \"off\" position, and then helped his technicians close the manual supply isolation valves to Zones 1 through 5, which stopped all water flow.", "lessons_learned": "The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system.Contributing causes included the following:The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off.A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians.The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off.The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987.The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves.Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water.There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems. The OPF Bay 1 configuration does not include the manual riser isolation valve. Engineering Order E084-79KO5423, which installs the manual riser isolation valve for both bay configurations, has not yet been accomplished for Bay 1. This should be implemented for Bay 1 after OV-103 rollout for STS-33 and prior to another Orbiter occupying Bay 1. There are only 6 boxes for the manual arming and firing valves in the Bay 1 configuration, with the arming and firing valves for a particular zone in the same box. The Bay 2 configuration has 12 boxes, one for each valve.

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time. The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life.

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach.

The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life.

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time.

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time. The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adequately consider fatigue in the design of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads may, at best, result in recurring costs for repair or replacement of components before their intended design life.

In addition, non real-time arraying of the signals from DSS-14 at Goldstone and DSS-43 at Canberra was to be attempted. This would consist of combining the tape-recorded signals from each of these stations to gain additional signal-to-noise ratio.

Contamination causes diminished optical throughput, creates off-axis radiation scattering due to particle clouds, and increases mirror scattering. Controlling molecular contaminates minimizes performance degradation caused by the deposition of molecular contaminants on mirrors, optical sensors and critical surfaces; improves cost-effectiveness of mission results; and improves reliability.Implementation Method:Contamination control of space optical systems consists of the planning, organization, and implementation of all activities needed to determine, achieve, and maintain the required cleanliness level of the optical system. Each optical system has its own unique contamination control requirements. To effectively control contamination, concurrent engineering procedures should be employed during design, manufacturing, precleaning, assembly, testing/checkout, transportation, storage, launch and on-orbit operations.The desired level of cleanliness, established during the design phase, determines the techniques required to accomplish the desired results. These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements. This person should not only interface with the systems engineers, but with the engineers and technicians responsible for design, materials, manufacturing, testing, checkout, facilities, and quality assurance. The contamination control engineer's responsibilities should include: 1) contamination control coordination, planning, and budgeting; 2) coordination of materials selection and testing; 3) participation in design reviews; 4) preparation of detailed contamination control requirements; 5) review and sign-off of engineering drawings, specifications, and procedures; and 6) monitoring with witness samples to meet budgeting allocations throughout each program phase. The contamination engineer and the quality assurance engineer should establish contamination control procedures for the assembly and test facilities. Monitoring of the facilities should be performed by quality assurance personnel.To avoid contamination of the optical critical surfaces, contamination control should be a foremost consideration in the design. Contamination sources can be minimized in the design by careful selection and testing of materials, coatings, and processes. Purging the optical system with clean, dry nitrogen during time the system is not in a clean environment (i.e., storage, transportation, idle times during test, etc.) is an effective method of controlling contamination. The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

Contamination causes diminished optical throughput, creates off-axis radiation scattering due to particle clouds, and increases mirror scattering. Controlling molecular contaminates minimizes performance degradation caused by the deposition of molecular contaminants on mirrors, optical sensors and critical surfaces; improves cost-effectiveness of mission results; and improves reliability.Implementation Method:Contamination control of space optical systems consists of the planning, organization, and implementation of all activities needed to determine, achieve, and maintain the required cleanliness level of the optical system. Each optical system has its own unique contamination control requirements. To effectively control contamination, concurrent engineering procedures should be employed during design, manufacturing, precleaning, assembly, testing/checkout, transportation, storage, launch and on-orbit operations.The desired level of cleanliness, established during the design phase, determines the techniques required to accomplish the desired results. These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements.

Contamination causes diminished optical throughput, creates off-axis radiation scattering due to particle clouds, and increases mirror scattering. Controlling molecular contaminates minimizes performance degradation caused by the deposition of molecular contaminants on mirrors, optical sensors and critical surfaces; improves cost-effectiveness of mission results; and improves reliability.Implementation Method:Contamination control of space optical systems consists of the planning, organization, and implementation of all activities needed to determine, achieve, and maintain the required cleanliness level of the optical system. Each optical system has its own unique contamination control requirements. To effectively control contamination, concurrent engineering procedures should be employed during design, manufacturing, precleaning, assembly, testing/checkout, transportation, storage, launch and on-orbit operations.The desired level of cleanliness, established during the design phase, determines the techniques required to accomplish the desired results. These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements. This person should not only interface with the systems engineers, but with the engineers and technicians responsible for design, materials, manufacturing, testing, checkout, facilities, and quality assurance. The contamination control engineer's responsibilities should include: 1) contamination control coordination, planning, and budgeting; 2) coordination of materials selection and testing; 3) participation in design reviews; 4) preparation of detailed contamination control requirements; 5) review and sign-off of engineering drawings, specifications, and procedures; and 6) monitoring with witness samples to meet budgeting allocations throughout each program phase. The contamination engineer and the quality assurance engineer should establish contamination control procedures for the assembly and test facilities. Monitoring of the facilities should be performed by quality assurance personnel.To avoid contamination of the optical critical surfaces, contamination control should be a foremost consideration in the design. Contamination sources can be minimized in the design by careful selection and testing of materials, coatings, and processes. Purging the optical system with clean, dry nitrogen during time the system is not in a clean environment (i.e., storage, transportation, idle times during test, etc.) is an effective method of controlling contamination. The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

The pyro valves and NASA standard initiators (NSIs) used aboard Mars Observer were designed to the same specifications, though they were not identical to the ESA hardware.During lot acceptance test, none of the ten pyro valves tested had failed-- all fired, and none ejected their initiators. Following the Mars Observer failure, examination showed that each of these valves had sustained erosion (burning) of about 50 percent of their threads. The erosion was caused by combustion of the titanium thread material with the combustion products of the initiator. This examination was not required in the original lot acceptance test of the parts.Were the thread loss to cause ejection of an initiator, severe damage to the spacecraft wiring, propellant tanks, and other critical hardware could result. For example, one of the Mars Observer initiators was located such that it would impact the monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propellant tank if it were ejected. The JPL Mars Observer Special Review Board considered a failed pyro valve charge initiator to be a potential cause of the loss of the Mars Observer mission.Reference(s): \"Report of the Mars Observer Mission Failure Investigation Board,\" (Coffey report), December 31, 1993.", "lessons_learned": "Successful lot functional acceptance tests may not detect incipient failure modes without post-test examination.Explosive initiators produce hot, reactive products which may create ejecta ranging from tiny debris particles to portions of the valve body, especially in the presence of titanium which is a highly reactive metal.", "recomendations": "Alert users of NSIs to the possibility of damage from ejected initiators.Parts and materials lot acceptance or qualification functional testing should include post-test examination to look for signs of inferred margin or incipient failure modes and should include destructive testing if necessary.The use of titanium in pyrotechnic applications should be carefully reviewed or avoided due to its highly reactive nature.", "evidence": "JPL has referenced this lesson learned as additional rationale and guidance supporting Paragraph 6.10 (\"Engineering Practices: Materials, Processes, and Contamination Control\") in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory standard \"Flight Project Practices, Rev. 7,\" JPL DocID 58032, September 30, 2008.In addition, JPL has referenced the lesson as supporting Paragraph 4.2.3.9 (\"Mechanical Configuration/System Design: Mechanisms - Mechanisms Cycle Life Design Margins\"), and Paragraph 4.2.5.6 (\"Mechanical Configuration/System Design: Structural Design - Structure Design Criteria for Actuators\"), in the JPL standard \"Design, Verification/Validation and Operations Principles for Flight Systems (Design Principles),\" JPL Document D-17868, Rev. 3, December 11, 2006.", "program_relation": "N/A", "phase": "None"}, {"subject": "Optical Fiber Cable Terminations Techniques and Procedures", "abstract": "None", "driving_event": "This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-EC-1110 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefits:This practice ensures the performance reliability of optical fiber cable assemblies by requiring the selection of optical fiber cable components that have been tested and approved for spaceflight use and by specifying approved assembly and acceptance inspection and test procedures.Implementation:The termination of optical fiber cables used in spaceflight applications is performed in accordance with the GSFC approved training document, Ref. 1, which defines approved material requirements and detailed assembly techniques and procedures. Ref. 1 is used by engineers, senior technicians and those involved in training personnel in the techniques of terminating optical fiber cable. The procedures defined in the Ref. 1 training document are applicable to the following items from the MIL-STD-975 NASA Standard Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical Parts List, (NSPL), and the GSFC Preferred Parts List-20, (PPL-20):MIL-T-29504/4&5 Type II adhesiveOptical fiber termini manufactured by Amphenol/Bendix and used in MIL-C-38999 Series III connectorsOC-1008 optical fiber cables manufactured by Brand-RexThis procedure may not be applicable to other types of optical fiber cable and termini which may require different stripping techniques, polishing steps, tools, materials, and assembly instructions, all of which must be documented and controlled when spaceflight hardware is assembled.Personnel are cautioned about the use of parts from manufacturers not specified in the procedure as the use of those parts could result in unreliable cables. Other manufacturer's parts may be used, however, provided they are tested at GSFC, meet GSFC performance requirements, and are interchangeable with approved parts as determined by GSFC.Ref. 1 provides lists of approved materials required by the procedure including part numbers, manufacturer/source, and specifications. Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"", "lessons_learned": "Impact of Nonpractice:Failure to select approved materials and to follow the fabrication and inspection procedures of this practice can result in limited initial performance and further significant degradation during space flight.

Ref. 1 is used by engineers, senior technicians and those involved in training personnel in the techniques of terminating optical fiber cable. The procedures defined in the Ref. 1 training document are applicable to the following items from the MIL-STD-975 NASA Standard Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical Parts List, (NSPL), and the GSFC Preferred Parts List-20, (PPL-20):MIL-T-29504/4&5 Type II adhesiveOptical fiber termini manufactured by Amphenol/Bendix and used in MIL-C-38999 Series III connectorsOC-1008 optical fiber cables manufactured by Brand-RexThis procedure may not be applicable to other types of optical fiber cable and termini which may require different stripping techniques, polishing steps, tools, materials, and assembly instructions, all of which must be documented and controlled when spaceflight hardware is assembled.Personnel are cautioned about the use of parts from manufacturers not specified in the procedure as the use of those parts could result in unreliable cables. Other manufacturer's parts may be used, however, provided they are tested at GSFC, meet GSFC performance requirements, and are interchangeable with approved parts as determined by GSFC.Ref. 1 provides lists of approved materials required by the procedure including part numbers, manufacturer/source, and specifications. Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"", "lessons_learned": "Impact of Nonpractice:Failure to select approved materials and to follow the fabrication and inspection procedures of this practice can result in limited initial performance and further significant degradation during space flight.

The procedures defined in the Ref. 1 training document are applicable to the following items from the MIL-STD-975 NASA Standard Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical Parts List, (NSPL), and the GSFC Preferred Parts List-20, (PPL-20):MIL-T-29504/4&5 Type II adhesiveOptical fiber termini manufactured by Amphenol/Bendix and used in MIL-C-38999 Series III connectorsOC-1008 optical fiber cables manufactured by Brand-RexThis procedure may not be applicable to other types of optical fiber cable and termini which may require different stripping techniques, polishing steps, tools, materials, and assembly instructions, all of which must be documented and controlled when spaceflight hardware is assembled.Personnel are cautioned about the use of parts from manufacturers not specified in the procedure as the use of those parts could result in unreliable cables. Other manufacturer's parts may be used, however, provided they are tested at GSFC, meet GSFC performance requirements, and are interchangeable with approved parts as determined by GSFC.Ref. 1 provides lists of approved materials required by the procedure including part numbers, manufacturer/source, and specifications. Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"", "lessons_learned": "Impact of Nonpractice:Failure to select approved materials and to follow the fabrication and inspection procedures of this practice can result in limited initial performance and further significant degradation during space flight.

This may identify potential adverse effects on operational reliability.", "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-EC-1106; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefits:Potential EMI sources are identified in time so that appropriate measures can be incorporated into the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) program. If the high predicted levels turn out to be a problem, the early identification allows time to develop a solution.Implementation Method:Perform a comprehensive survey of the mission environments and payload characteristics, then determine the possible sources of plasma generated noise. If the source of plasma noise is from the natural occurring space plasma or arises from the motion of a spacecraft through the earth's geomagnetic field, the radiated susceptibility (RS03) test levels specified in MIL-STD-461C will be adequate. The magnitude of plasma waves in the natural space environment is usually limited by the thermal energy of the ambient plasma. Due to the low plasma densities of the earth and other planets, the energy content of the naturally occurring space plasma is relatively low. It can easily be shown that the MIL-STD-461C radiated susceptibility RS03 limits are adequate to demonstrate a spacecraft's immunity to EMI generated by natural plasma noise.The RS03 specifications are:Frequency Range E-Field (Volts/meter)14 kHz to 30 MHz1030 MHz to 10 GHz5Above 10 GHz20For large conducting structures moving across the geomagnetic field, additional plasma noise is generated as a result of wave emission due to the motion induced VxB electric field. In low earth orbit, the noise level generated by a typical space station structure is estimated to be 10-3 V/m per ampere current (ref. 1) and that of a tethered satellite system is 10-1 V/m (ref. 2). Since the typical current flow for the space station and the tethered satellite is less than 1 Amp, the electric field generated by motion of a space structure will also be enveloped by the MIL-STD-461C RS03 limits.Plasma can also cause structure current (conducted emission) to flow in the spacecraft. In the absence of any externally induced events, the net current to the spacecraft structure is always zero. When the spacecraft goes in and out of eclipse, a transient current would be induced on the spacecraft structure. Since the time scale of this type of transition is relatively long, on the order of seconds, and the current involved is the plasma current that can be collected by a spacecraft (which is on the order of 0.1A), this transient current will not be a EMI source of any concern.Technical Rationale:Electron beam experiments can generate high levels of conducted and radiated EMI. When an electron beam is injected into the plasma from a spacecraft, a return current must be present in order for the current loop to be completed. The rise time of this return current is determined by the transit time of thermal electrons through the sheath surrounding the spacecraft. This time scale is >0.1 ms (ref. 3 and 4). The upper bound value of the peak return current is given by the peak injected electron beam current. Therefore, the dI/dt of the structure current will be in the range of 108 A/s (assuming a peak current of 10 Amp). For programs that have tests to demonstrate immunity against lightning or ESD inducted structure current, the dI/dt of those test specifications are usually >104 A/ms and thus they envelope the dI/dt induced by electron beam. For a program that has no test specifications for structure current, it should be added to the EMC program if an electron beam experiment is on-board. This is particularly important when the beam current exceeds 10 Amp.The injected electron beam also generates large amplitude waves in the ambient plasma (ref. 5). A comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the maximum amplitude of the beam generated plasma noise. This analysis involves an estimate of the conversion efficiency of the beam energy into electromagnetic wave energy. Usually this conversion efficiency has an upper bound value of 1% (ref. 6). Once the amplitude of the EMI produced by beam generated waves has been determined, the adequacy of the MIL-STD-461C RS03 specifications can be evaluated. Similar approaches can be applied to determine the EMI resulting from the interaction of an ion engine plume and the ambient plasma.References:Hastings, D. and Wang J.

If the high predicted levels turn out to be a problem, the early identification allows time to develop a solution.Implementation Method:Perform a comprehensive survey of the mission environments and payload characteristics, then determine the possible sources of plasma generated noise. If the source of plasma noise is from the natural occurring space plasma or arises from the motion of a spacecraft through the earth's geomagnetic field, the radiated susceptibility (RS03) test levels specified in MIL-STD-461C will be adequate. The magnitude of plasma waves in the natural space environment is usually limited by the thermal energy of the ambient plasma. Due to the low plasma densities of the earth and other planets, the energy content of the naturally occurring space plasma is relatively low. It can easily be shown that the MIL-STD-461C radiated susceptibility RS03 limits are adequate to demonstrate a spacecraft's immunity to EMI generated by natural plasma noise.The RS03 specifications are:Frequency Range E-Field (Volts/meter)14 kHz to 30 MHz1030 MHz to 10 GHz5Above 10 GHz20For large conducting structures moving across the geomagnetic field, additional plasma noise is generated as a result of wave emission due to the motion induced VxB electric field. In low earth orbit, the noise level generated by a typical space station structure is estimated to be 10-3 V/m per ampere current (ref. 1) and that of a tethered satellite system is 10-1 V/m (ref. 2). Since the typical current flow for the space station and the tethered satellite is less than 1 Amp, the electric field generated by motion of a space structure will also be enveloped by the MIL-STD-461C RS03 limits.Plasma can also cause structure current (conducted emission) to flow in the spacecraft. In the absence of any externally induced events, the net current to the spacecraft structure is always zero. When the spacecraft goes in and out of eclipse, a transient current would be induced on the spacecraft structure. Since the time scale of this type of transition is relatively long, on the order of seconds, and the current involved is the plasma current that can be collected by a spacecraft (which is on the order of 0.1A), this transient current will not be a EMI source of any concern.Technical Rationale:Electron beam experiments can generate high levels of conducted and radiated EMI. When an electron beam is injected into the plasma from a spacecraft, a return current must be present in order for the current loop to be completed. The rise time of this return current is determined by the transit time of thermal electrons through the sheath surrounding the spacecraft. This time scale is >0.1 ms (ref. 3 and 4). The upper bound value of the peak return current is given by the peak injected electron beam current. Therefore, the dI/dt of the structure current will be in the range of 108 A/s (assuming a peak current of 10 Amp). For programs that have tests to demonstrate immunity against lightning or ESD inducted structure current, the dI/dt of those test specifications are usually >104 A/ms and thus they envelope the dI/dt induced by electron beam. For a program that has no test specifications for structure current, it should be added to the EMC program if an electron beam experiment is on-board. This is particularly important when the beam current exceeds 10 Amp.The injected electron beam also generates large amplitude waves in the ambient plasma (ref. 5). A comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the maximum amplitude of the beam generated plasma noise. This analysis involves an estimate of the conversion efficiency of the beam energy into electromagnetic wave energy. Usually this conversion efficiency has an upper bound value of 1% (ref. 6). Once the amplitude of the EMI produced by beam generated waves has been determined, the adequacy of the MIL-STD-461C RS03 specifications can be evaluated.

Due to the low plasma densities of the earth and other planets, the energy content of the naturally occurring space plasma is relatively low. It can easily be shown that the MIL-STD-461C radiated susceptibility RS03 limits are adequate to demonstrate a spacecraft's immunity to EMI generated by natural plasma noise.The RS03 specifications are:Frequency Range E-Field (Volts/meter)14 kHz to 30 MHz1030 MHz to 10 GHz5Above 10 GHz20For large conducting structures moving across the geomagnetic field, additional plasma noise is generated as a result of wave emission due to the motion induced VxB electric field. In low earth orbit, the noise level generated by a typical space station structure is estimated to be 10-3 V/m per ampere current (ref. 1) and that of a tethered satellite system is 10-1 V/m (ref. 2). Since the typical current flow for the space station and the tethered satellite is less than 1 Amp, the electric field generated by motion of a space structure will also be enveloped by the MIL-STD-461C RS03 limits.Plasma can also cause structure current (conducted emission) to flow in the spacecraft. In the absence of any externally induced events, the net current to the spacecraft structure is always zero. When the spacecraft goes in and out of eclipse, a transient current would be induced on the spacecraft structure. Since the time scale of this type of transition is relatively long, on the order of seconds, and the current involved is the plasma current that can be collected by a spacecraft (which is on the order of 0.1A), this transient current will not be a EMI source of any concern.Technical Rationale:Electron beam experiments can generate high levels of conducted and radiated EMI. When an electron beam is injected into the plasma from a spacecraft, a return current must be present in order for the current loop to be completed. The rise time of this return current is determined by the transit time of thermal electrons through the sheath surrounding the spacecraft. This time scale is >0.1 ms (ref. 3 and 4). The upper bound value of the peak return current is given by the peak injected electron beam current. Therefore, the dI/dt of the structure current will be in the range of 108 A/s (assuming a peak current of 10 Amp). For programs that have tests to demonstrate immunity against lightning or ESD inducted structure current, the dI/dt of those test specifications are usually >104 A/ms and thus they envelope the dI/dt induced by electron beam. For a program that has no test specifications for structure current, it should be added to the EMC program if an electron beam experiment is on-board. This is particularly important when the beam current exceeds 10 Amp.The injected electron beam also generates large amplitude waves in the ambient plasma (ref. 5). A comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the maximum amplitude of the beam generated plasma noise. This analysis involves an estimate of the conversion efficiency of the beam energy into electromagnetic wave energy. Usually this conversion efficiency has an upper bound value of 1% (ref. 6). Once the amplitude of the EMI produced by beam generated waves has been determined, the adequacy of the MIL-STD-461C RS03 specifications can be evaluated. Similar approaches can be applied to determine the EMI resulting from the interaction of an ion engine plume and the ambient plasma.References:Hastings, D. and Wang J.

With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable \"o\"-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments.Implementation Method:1. BackgroundThe Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes.2. Case-to-Case Field Joint ImprovementsSpace Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1.The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a \"capture\" feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the \"tang\" on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.References360L001 Acceptance Review: Morton Thiokol, Inc.

A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a \"capture\" feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the \"tang\" on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.References360L001 Acceptance Review: Morton Thiokol, Inc.

With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable \"o\"-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments.Implementation Method:1. BackgroundThe Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes.2. Case-to-Case Field Joint ImprovementsSpace Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1.The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a \"capture\" feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the \"tang\" on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.References360L001 Acceptance Review: Morton Thiokol, Inc.

Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts. Leak checks are performed on all sensor welds.Manufacturing and Assembly Practices:Closely controlled manufacturing and routing procedures have proven to be essential in the manufacturing and assembly of sensors as well as the installation and testing of instrumentation systems. Inspection points are added during pre-assembly or partial assembly steps if inspection would be difficult at later steps in the process. Inspection steps are added prior to any cavity closeout, and prior to the use of coatings, sealants, or potting compounds that could mask contaminants. Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed. Heat sinks are provided in tooling for electron-beam weld joints. High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data. Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone. These design and process changes implemented many of the practices described in this document, and a much higher reliability of the resulting modified sensor is expected. The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adhere to the practices suggested herein could result in contamination entry into sensors, excessive uncompensated sensor drift, incompatibility of the instrumentation system with other subsystems, failure to meet telemetry requirements, and possible loss of the mission through inadequate diagnostics and inappropriate control or vehicle destruction.

The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adhere to the practices suggested herein could result in contamination entry into sensors, excessive uncompensated sensor drift, incompatibility of the instrumentation system with other subsystems, failure to meet telemetry requirements, and possible loss of the mission through inadequate diagnostics and inappropriate control or vehicle destruction.

Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts. Leak checks are performed on all sensor welds.Manufacturing and Assembly Practices:Closely controlled manufacturing and routing procedures have proven to be essential in the manufacturing and assembly of sensors as well as the installation and testing of instrumentation systems. Inspection points are added during pre-assembly or partial assembly steps if inspection would be difficult at later steps in the process. Inspection steps are added prior to any cavity closeout, and prior to the use of coatings, sealants, or potting compounds that could mask contaminants. Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed. Heat sinks are provided in tooling for electron-beam weld joints. High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data. Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone.

High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data. Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone. These design and process changes implemented many of the practices described in this document, and a much higher reliability of the resulting modified sensor is expected. The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.", "lessons_learned": "Failure to adhere to the practices suggested herein could result in contamination entry into sensors, excessive uncompensated sensor drift, incompatibility of the instrumentation system with other subsystems, failure to meet telemetry requirements, and possible loss of the mission through inadequate diagnostics and inappropriate control or vehicle destruction.

Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts. Leak checks are performed on all sensor welds.Manufacturing and Assembly Practices:Closely controlled manufacturing and routing procedures have proven to be essential in the manufacturing and assembly of sensors as well as the installation and testing of instrumentation systems. Inspection points are added during pre-assembly or partial assembly steps if inspection would be difficult at later steps in the process. Inspection steps are added prior to any cavity closeout, and prior to the use of coatings, sealants, or potting compounds that could mask contaminants. Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed.
