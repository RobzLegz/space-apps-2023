    "abstract": "None",
    "driving_event": "The Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Bay 2 Firex Deluge Zone 3 Viking arm valve AV1.3-2 was leaking, and on September 21, 1989, Problem Report (PR) number PV-6-140247 was initiated to replace defective parts. During system leak check operations following valve repair, water flow from zone 3 (directly over the Orbiter) occurred in OPF Bay 2. The time of first flow was established as 10:28 AM on September 24, 1989, as recorded by OPF Water Pump House instrumentation due to diesel pump startup. The Zone 3 water flow over the Orbiter was at a reduced rate, with only a partial nozzle discharge pattern.Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) Water Systems technicians were cycling the manual arming and firing valves while leak checking the system. Only a few minutes had passed from the time they cracked open (2 turns) the system manual supply valve until they heard about the water flow problem in Bay 2. The SPC Lead Water Systems technician ran into the OPF to see what was wrong and noted the deluge flow. He returned to the manual activation station behind the OPF and found that two SPC ground support equipment (GSE) technicians had opened the manual arming and firing valve to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It is presumed Zone 3 did not flow additional water and had been deactivated by this time.) The Lead Water Systems technician then closed all the open manual arming and firing valves, as well as the manual supply isolation valves to stop all Bay 2 water flow.The scenario that lead to the two GSE technicians being at the deluge system manual flow control valve station is as follows:After the flow from Zone 3 occurred, the SPC OPF Bay 1 Site Division Manager asked a GSE technician to find someone who could turn the system off. This GSE technician, accompanied by a co-worker, proceeded to the manual activation station behind Bay 2. Upon arrival, they proceeded to position the manual arming and firing valves to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the \"on\" position, thinking they were turning the firex system off. This turned on deluge system Zones 1, 2, 4, and 5 (Zone 3 had already been deactivated) to the \"full on\" mode. The Lead Water Systems technician then returned to the manual valve panels, proceeded to turn the manual arming and firing valves to the \"off\" position, and then helped his technicians close the manual supply isolation valves to Zones 1 through 5, which stopped all water flow.",
    "lessons_learned": "The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system.Contributing causes included the following:The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off.A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians.The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off.The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987.The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves.Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water.There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems. The OPF Bay 1 configuration does not include the manual riser isolation valve. Engineering Order E084-79KO5423, which installs the manual riser isolation valve for both bay configurations, has not yet been accomplished for Bay 1. This should be implemented for Bay 1 after OV-103 rollout for STS-33 and prior to another Orbiter occupying Bay 1. There are only 6 boxes for the manual arming and firing valves in the Bay 1 configuration, with the arming and firing valves for a particular zone in the same box. The Bay 2 configuration has 12 boxes, one for each valve. Signs on the boxes are not uniform between OPF Bays 1 and 2.The NASA Test Director (NTD) evacuated OPF Bay 2 via a public address announcement. He could not use the area warning system because OPF Bay 1 would have also been evacuated, which was not required.As a result of the inadvertent activation of the firex deluge system, Orbiter GSE was damaged (i.e., the Mechanical Control Interface Unit for the Remote Manipulating Arm and the Cargo Verification Unit). No redundancy is available for the Mechanical Control Interface Unit.The OPF Bay 2 evacuation during this incident was in accordance with established procedures. Security control of Bay 2 was properly maintained. All personnel and emergency service actions were professional and properly carried out.",
    "recomendations": "Emphasize to all individuals involved in the work task that proper procedure execution is mandatory.Access to the OPF deluge system Zones 1 through 6 should be positively controlled (e.g., a lock and key arrangement). Personnel with access should be fully trained and certified in the operation of the system.A policy should be developed outlining which operations/ activities require PTBS. This policy should be rigorously implemented when developed.As part of the reassessment of the use of this system, all control panels should be properly labeled. A positive position for open versus closed should be readily visible on all valves.The manual arming and firing valves should be oriented to the industry norm and provided with specific open and closed position markings.Access to OPF deluge system Zones 1 through 6 should be positively controlled (e.g., a lock and key arrangement). Personnel with access should be fully trained and certified in the operation of the system.The policy of free access to the water deluge control panel key should be reviewed.Evaluate the risk of inadvertent OPF deluge system water flow with the current system design.The water deluge system valve repair task was not observed by Engineering, which could have prevented the deviation to written procedure by the facility water technicians.When malfunctions on critical facility/GSE systems occur which could affect flight hardware, a clear policy is required that outlines what level of management approval is needed to initiate repairs.The OPF area warning system should be split between Bay 1 and Bay 2, enabling the NTD to only evacuate one OPF bay when the emergency does not warrant evacuating both bays.Non-redundant GSE should be identified, and workarounds developed if this GSE is destroyed or incapacitated for an extended period of time.",

    "driving_event": "The Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Bay 2 Firex Deluge Zone 3 Viking arm valve AV1.3-2 was leaking, and on September 21, 1989, Problem Report (PR) number PV-6-140247 was initiated to replace defective parts. During system leak check operations following valve repair, water flow from zone 3 (directly over the Orbiter) occurred in OPF Bay 2. The time of first flow was established as 10:28 AM on September 24, 1989, as recorded by OPF Water Pump House instrumentation due to diesel pump startup. The Zone 3 water flow over the Orbiter was at a reduced rate, with only a partial nozzle discharge pattern.Shuttle Processing Contract (SPC) Water Systems technicians were cycling the manual arming and firing valves while leak checking the system. Only a few minutes had passed from the time they cracked open (2 turns) the system manual supply valve until they heard about the water flow problem in Bay 2. The SPC Lead Water Systems technician ran into the OPF to see what was wrong and noted the deluge flow. He returned to the manual activation station behind the OPF and found that two SPC ground support equipment (GSE) technicians had opened the manual arming and firing valve to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. (It is presumed Zone 3 did not flow additional water and had been deactivated by this time.) The Lead Water Systems technician then closed all the open manual arming and firing valves, as well as the manual supply isolation valves to stop all Bay 2 water flow.The scenario that lead to the two GSE technicians being at the deluge system manual flow control valve station is as follows:After the flow from Zone 3 occurred, the SPC OPF Bay 1 Site Division Manager asked a GSE technician to find someone who could turn the system off. This GSE technician, accompanied by a co-worker, proceeded to the manual activation station behind Bay 2. Upon arrival, they proceeded to position the manual arming and firing valves to Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to the \"on\" position, thinking they were turning the firex system off. This turned on deluge system Zones 1, 2, 4, and 5 (Zone 3 had already been deactivated) to the \"full on\" mode. The Lead Water Systems technician then returned to the manual valve panels, proceeded to turn the manual arming and firing valves to the \"off\" position, and then helped his technicians close the manual supply isolation valves to Zones 1 through 5, which stopped all water flow.",
    "lessons_learned": "The primary cause of the mishap was failure to follow the procedural instructions in PR number PV-6-140247, in which: (1) facility water technicians added a flow test on the Zone 3 system after valve diaphragm repair, and (2) in not fully closing or in improperly reopening the manual riser isolation valve, water was allowed to flow into Zone 3 of the OPF Bay 2 water deluge system.Contributing causes included the following:The OPF GSE technicians, who are members of the \"Contingency Team,\" had not been adequately trained in the operation of the OPF water deluge system. This led to the OPF GSE \"Contingency Team\" technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system, while thinking they were turning the system off.A thorough pre-task briefing (PTB) was not held for the water deluge system valve repair task, which could have prevented deviation from the repair procedure by the facility water technicians.The labeling on the remote manual arming and firing valve activation station of the OPF water deluge system was misinterpreted. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians activating Zones 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the Bay 2 deluge system when they believed they were turning the system off.The remote manual arming and firing valves are in the \"on\" position when perpendicular to the water lines, which is not the industry norm for hydraulic systems. This contributed to the OPF GSE technicians believing they were closing the valves by positioning them perpendicular to the water line when, in fact, they were opening the valves. This human factor problem was not addressed in the System Assurance Analysis for the Water System at the OPF, SAA09FY09-007, Revision B, dated July 1987.The manual arming and firing valves behind the OPF are easily accessed by simply opening the individual valve box doors, which destroys the paper integrity seals. Essentially, there was no physical barrier to the valves.Even though redundancy exists for the Viking valves in the deluge system, these valves are open when no dome pressure is applied. Failures which remove dome pressure could result in the flow of water.There are significant configuration differences between the OPF Bay 1 and 2 water deluge systems.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Guideline Number GD-AP-2303 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefit:Consideration of fatigue reliability during the design process can assist in the prevention of failures of structural and mechanical components subject to fluctuating loads in service. Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time. The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability",

The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability",

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time.

The application of these data will enable optimal designs to be achieved which balance the initial costs of design and fabrication against the expected costs of repair, replacement, and/or failure.References:NASA Contractor Report, Larsen, C.E., \"Probabilistic Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics Analysis for Structural/Mechanical Reliability\", To be released, 1994.Crandall, S.H., and Mark, W.D., Random Vibration in Mechanical Systems, Academic Press, New York, 1973Miles, J.W., \"On Statistical Fatigue Under Random Loading\", Journal of Aeronautical Sciences, Vol. 21, 1954, pp. 753-762Wirsching, P.H., and Light, M.C., \"Fatigue Under Wide Band Random Stress\", Journal of the Structural Division, ASCE, Vol. 106, No. ST7, July, 1980, paper 15574, pp. 1593-1607Lutes, L.D., and Larsen, C.E., \"Improved Spectral Method for Variable Amplitude Fatigue Prediction\", Journal of Structural Engineering, ASCE, Vol. 116, No. 4, April, 1990, paper 24612, pp. 1149-1164Larsen, C.E., and Lutes, L.D., \"Predicting the Fatigue Life of Offshore Structures by the Single-Moment Spectral Method\", Probabilistic Engineering Mechanics, Vol. 6, No. 2, June, 1991, pp. 96-108Madsen, H.O., Krenk, S., and Lind, N.C., Methods of Structural Safety, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1986PROBAN-2: Example Manual, Report No. 89-2025, A.S Veritas Research, Hovik, Norway, August, 1989Sutharshana, S., et al., \"Probabilistic High Cycle Fatigue Failure Analysis Applicable to Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines\", Proceedings of the AIAA/ASME/ASCE/AHS/ASC 31st Annual Structures, Structural Dynamics and Materials Conference, April, 1990Reliability Preferred Practice Guideline Number GD-AP-2304: Fracture Mechanics Reliability",

Explicit consideration of the reliability of structural and mechanical components provides the means to evaluate alternative designs and to ensure that specified risk levels are met. Probabilistic fatigue analyses may also be applied to life extension of existing structures, and for problem assessment of in-service fatigue failures.Potential applications of this guideline to the Space Shuttle or International Space Station Alpha Programs include: landing gear, control surfaces, main engine components, auxiliary power unit components, external tank and solid rocket booster welds, pressure vessels, propulsion modules, and logistics modules.Implementation Method:A detailed discussion of the procedures for performing a spectral fatigue reliability analysis may be found in reference 1. A \"classical\" fatigue approach is described which utilizes the constant amplitude S-N curve characterization of a material's or component's fatigue resistance capability. The applied random loads are characterized by their power spectral density (PSD), and crack initiation locations (or hot spots) are determined by an analytical or experimental stress analysis. A structural dynamic analysis or test is used to determine the harmonic response function, H(w), which relates external loads to nominal internal stress.The mean or average fatigue life, T, is computed using either the Rayleigh [references 2, 3, and 4] or Single-Moment methods [references 5 and 6]. For high-cycle fatigue (high number of cycles) the uncertainty or randomness in the fatigue life due to the random loading is negligible (although load uncertainty is generally problem specific) [reference 2], but considerable uncertainty remains due to intrinsic metallurgical and geometric variations. In the usual deterministic fatigue analysis practice this uncertainty is accounted for by reducing the computed fatigue life by a \"scatter factor\" of 2 to 4 to determine the \"safe\" life. In a probabilistic approach the metallurgical and geometric variations are more rationally included by modeling them as random variables, using data from the S-N curve fitting and/or from the stress analysis. Sufficient data is necessary for statistical treatment (such as correlation analysis and distribution fitting) and is discussed in reference 1. However, even in cases for which sufficient problem specific data does not yet exist for rigorous statistical treatment, probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) methods may be used to construct distributions for the variables based on experts' opinions of the variables' range and likely values. Such an approach is useful as a first approximation until problem specific data becomes available and has the advantage of formally using the same \"expert data\" (engineering experience) that is usually only informally used in selecting the \"scatter factor\".The resulting expressions for the distribution of the time to failure are generally not amenable to solution by analytic techniques. However, modern numerical structural reliability methods [reference 7] are available for solving these types of problems in several commercial software packages, such as PROBAN [reference 8], STRUREL, and NESSUS. These programs allow the characterization of any number of parameters in a problem as random variables. Usually this requires the characterization of the problem in the form of a mathematical expression or a computer subroutine which relates the input variables to some characteristic output variables which determine the failed or safe state of the system modeled. Simulation methods such as Monte Carlo, importance sampling, latin hypercubes, directional sampling, or axis-orthogonal sampling are also available in PROBAN. A Monte Carlo simulation approach to a Space Shuttle Main Engine fatigue problem is also described in reference 9. These methods are compared and their relative merits are discussed in reference 1.The results of a probabilistic fatigue analysis are usually expressed as the probability of failure as a function of time. For dealing with very high reliabilities, the reliability index, b, is often used as defined by:[D]An example of the change in reliability with time due to fatigue is given in Figure 1. The corresponding plot of reliability index as a function of time is given in Figure 2. The details of this example are given in reference 1. The expected or average time to failure for this example is 1265 seconds, at which time the reliability is 50% and the reliability index is zero. Also shown in Figures 1 and 2 are the times corresponding to the usual definition of \"safe life\" determined by using a scatter factor of 2 to 4. Using a scatter factor of 4 results in a safe life of 316 seconds, while a scatter factor of 2 gives a safe life of 632 seconds. Adoption of a reliability approach would allow specification of the safe life as the time at which the reliability or reliability index decreased below some minimum acceptable level. In this example that level was chosen to be the \"3-sigma\" level, at which the reliability is 99.865% or the reliability index is 3.0. This results in a safe (or allowable) life of 869 seconds, a 37% increase in allowable life compared to the scatter factor of 2 life, and a 175% increase compared to the scatter factor of 4 life. The conservatism inherent in the deterministic scatter factor approach is illustrated more clearly in Figure 2. In this example a scatter factor of 2 corresponds to a reliability index of 5.6, while a scatter factor of 4 corresponds to a reliability index of 11.2.Fatigue Reliability Index as a Function of Time[D][D]Use of a probabilistic method allows the uncertainty in fatigue life or time to failure to be more explicitly accounted for than is possible in the \"scatter factor\" approach. Sensitivity analysis methods are also available in some of the commercial software packages, allowing the uncertain input variables to be ranked according to their contribution to the uncertainty in the resulting life estimate. This enables a more timely and cost effective design optimization by identifying the most important input parameters upon which resources should be concentrated to gain the greatest increase in life. This approach naturally leads to a design risk assessment and requires the development and selection of a specific criteria for defining acceptable risk or probability of failure. The acceptable risk value should be specified in the appropriate program requirements, but the selection process is a program and policy issue which is beyond the scope of this guideline. Some guidance is available from the various national civil structural requirements codes that have been formulated to provide reliability indices of 3 to 5, depending on the importance of the structure and the consequences of failure [reference 7].This method is primarily useful as a design evaluation or optimization tool and cannot easily be used to evaluate the remaining life of an in-service component unless instrumentation (such as strain gages, accelerometers, or load cells) is in place to allow collection of data on the actual performance of the component. In cases where the necessary in-service data is available, this method may prove very useful for extending the life of the component or structure beyond its original predicted service life. If inspection of the component or structure by a non-destructive evaluation (NDE) method is feasible, the probabilistic fracture mechanics method described in the companion guideline is more useful for estimating damage and remaining life of in-service components than the fatigue analysis method. A measured crack length provides information about the in-service state of the structure, and the probabilistic fracture analysis may be updated following the inspection to this new information. If inspection is not feasible, the fracture mechanics method has no particular advantage over the fatigue method for in-service assessments.Technical Rationale:The potential loss of strength in structural/mechanical components due to the cumulative damage effect of fluctuating applied loads is well known. Spectacular failures have resulted from fatigue since the beginning of the industrial revolution. The danger of fatigue in new applications, however, has not always been adequately considered in the design process and continues to be a concern to this day. A classic example is the British Comet airliner, which was one of the first aircraft to employ an aluminum-skin, pressurized fuselage. The loss of three aircraft and many lives in 1953 and 1954 occurred before the potential for fatigue in this application was understood.Results from the theory of stochastic process and modern structural reliability methods enable the design engineer to assess the expected fatigue life of structural and mechanical components subject to randomly varying loads, and to estimate how the probability of failure of the component increases over time.

    "subject": "Contamination Control of Space Optical Systems",
    "abstract": "None",
    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1263; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Controlling contamination of space optical systems limits the amount of particulate and molecular contamination which could cause performance degradation. Contamination causes diminished optical throughput, creates off-axis radiation scattering due to particle clouds, and increases mirror scattering. Controlling molecular contaminates minimizes performance degradation caused by the deposition of molecular contaminants on mirrors, optical sensors and critical surfaces; improves cost-effectiveness of mission results; and improves reliability.Implementation Method:Contamination control of space optical systems consists of the planning, organization, and implementation of all activities needed to determine, achieve, and maintain the required cleanliness level of the optical system. Each optical system has its own unique contamination control requirements. To effectively control contamination, concurrent engineering procedures should be employed during design, manufacturing, precleaning, assembly, testing/checkout, transportation, storage, launch and on-orbit operations.The desired level of cleanliness, established during the design phase, determines the techniques required to accomplish the desired results. These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements. This person should not only interface with the systems engineers, but with the engineers and technicians responsible for design, materials, manufacturing, testing, checkout, facilities, and quality assurance. The contamination control engineer's responsibilities should include: 1) contamination control coordination, planning, and budgeting; 2) coordination of materials selection and testing; 3) participation in design reviews; 4) preparation of detailed contamination control requirements; 5) review and sign-off of engineering drawings, specifications, and procedures; and 6) monitoring with witness samples to meet budgeting allocations throughout each program phase. The contamination engineer and the quality assurance engineer should establish contamination control procedures for the assembly and test facilities. Monitoring of the facilities should be performed by quality assurance personnel.To avoid contamination of the optical critical surfaces, contamination control should be a foremost consideration in the design. Contamination sources can be minimized in the design by careful selection and testing of materials, coatings, and processes. Purging the optical system with clean, dry nitrogen during time the system is not in a clean environment (i.e., storage, transportation, idle times during test, etc.) is an effective method of controlling contamination. The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

Contamination causes diminished optical throughput, creates off-axis radiation scattering due to particle clouds, and increases mirror scattering. Controlling molecular contaminates minimizes performance degradation caused by the deposition of molecular contaminants on mirrors, optical sensors and critical surfaces; improves cost-effectiveness of mission results; and improves reliability.Implementation Method:Contamination control of space optical systems consists of the planning, organization, and implementation of all activities needed to determine, achieve, and maintain the required cleanliness level of the optical system. Each optical system has its own unique contamination control requirements. To effectively control contamination, concurrent engineering procedures should be employed during design, manufacturing, precleaning, assembly, testing/checkout, transportation, storage, launch and on-orbit operations.The desired level of cleanliness, established during the design phase, determines the techniques required to accomplish the desired results. These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements. This person should not only interface with the systems engineers, but with the engineers and technicians responsible for design, materials, manufacturing, testing, checkout, facilities, and quality assurance. The contamination control engineer's responsibilities should include: 1) contamination control coordination, planning, and budgeting; 2) coordination of materials selection and testing; 3) participation in design reviews; 4) preparation of detailed contamination control requirements; 5) review and sign-off of engineering drawings, specifications, and procedures; and 6) monitoring with witness samples to meet budgeting allocations throughout each program phase. The contamination engineer and the quality assurance engineer should establish contamination control procedures for the assembly and test facilities. Monitoring of the facilities should be performed by quality assurance personnel.To avoid contamination of the optical critical surfaces, contamination control should be a foremost consideration in the design. Contamination sources can be minimized in the design by careful selection and testing of materials, coatings, and processes. Purging the optical system with clean, dry nitrogen during time the system is not in a clean environment (i.e., storage, transportation, idle times during test, etc.) is an effective method of controlling contamination. The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

These steps should be documented in a contamination control plan which can be developed by utilizing the following steps:Determine degree of cleanliness required.Prepare design with optimum materials, configuration, and tolerances to help accomplish the desired cleanliness level.Select and train personnel in contamination control techniques.Select and use the proper materials, equipment, and processes to accomplish the desired end result.Implement contamination budgeting and monitoring throughout each program phase.Plan the product flow to minimize the chance of recontamination after cleaning.Select qualified personnel and equipment to monitor the cleaning processes.The major sources of particulate contamination are:Airborne particulates settling on hardware surfaces during manufacturing, assembling, and testing operations.Paint overspray, insulation shreds, clothing fibers, and other human-induced substances.Trapped particles on internal surfaces of subassemblies and in other hardware crevices. These are released and redispersed from acoustic vibration, transportation, and launch.Reaction control system (RCS) or main propulsion system plume exhaust and flash evaporator water release that may create residual cloud environments.The major sources of molecular contamination are:Manufacturing residues (machine and cutting oils) which result from fabrication of hardware.Material outgassing.Space vehicle surface outgassing during ascent, deployment, and retrieval operations.Ground and air transportation environments.Volatile condensable materials in the environment to which contamination-sensitive, critical surfaces may be exposed during assembly operations.Return flux of outgassed molecules due to collisions with residual atmospheric molecules.Propulsion system plume impingements causing deposition of nonvolatile substances (MMH-Nitrate) on optical surfaces.Oxidation through exposure to atomic oxygen present in low-earth orbit.A contamination control engineer should be assigned the responsibility for coordinating contamination control requirements. This person should not only interface with the systems engineers, but with the engineers and technicians responsible for design, materials, manufacturing, testing, checkout, facilities, and quality assurance. The contamination control engineer's responsibilities should include: 1) contamination control coordination, planning, and budgeting; 2) coordination of materials selection and testing; 3) participation in design reviews; 4) preparation of detailed contamination control requirements; 5) review and sign-off of engineering drawings, specifications, and procedures; and 6) monitoring with witness samples to meet budgeting allocations throughout each program phase. The contamination engineer and the quality assurance engineer should establish contamination control procedures for the assembly and test facilities. Monitoring of the facilities should be performed by quality assurance personnel.To avoid contamination of the optical critical surfaces, contamination control should be a foremost consideration in the design. Contamination sources can be minimized in the design by careful selection and testing of materials, coatings, and processes. Purging the optical system with clean, dry nitrogen during time the system is not in a clean environment (i.e., storage, transportation, idle times during test, etc.) is an effective method of controlling contamination. The selection and testing of organic materials should be accomplished per MSFC-SPEC-1443 (ref. 6).Clean room assembly areas should be maintained to class 10,000 and clean benches to class 100 per MSFC-STD-246. After fabrication, all parts should be cleaned, outgassed per established procedures, doubled-bagged using approved material and sealing methods, and placed in bonded storage. Electronic assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment and double bagged. Mechanical assemblies should be assembled in a separate class 10,000 or better clean environment. Electronic assemblies, mechanic assemblies, and structural subassemblies should remain double-bagged until brought into final assembly clean area. Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

Structural assemblies and optical instrument assemblies should be assembled in a closely-monitored and controlled class 10,000 clean room. All required personnel required for assembly must be trained for work in a clean room environment.After assembly, optical instruments should be double-bagged for purging with dry nitrogen to help maintain cleanliness. The final assembly should be tested in at least a class 100,000 clean area. Optics should be protected when they are exposed during the test and monitored with witness samples which should be checked after the test. After testing, the optical instrument is double-bagged and prepared for purging with dry nitrogen during storage or shipping to the launch site.Measurement, Tracking, and ControlThe following training in precision cleaning should be provided to personnel required to enter a clean room: clean room maintenance, hardware handling, and clean room operational procedures and principles. The optical system and clean room should be monitored and measurements recorded using automatic particle counters, total hydrocarbon analyzers, temperature/relative humidity measurements, and pressure fallout sampling of particulate and molecular contaminants. These measurements should be tracked against the contamination budgeting plan. Fallout sampling is usually checked with optical witness samples that are strategically placed throughout the clean room and optical system.During the monitoring for contamination of the clean room and optical system, any contamination control discrepancy should be resolved with the contamination control engineer to determine the impact on the optical system. This impact will be weighed against the contamination budget and should be dispositioned by the materials review board.Technical Rationale:Contamination control is vital in aerospace optical systems to maintain high reliability and clarity of images. Ground and space contamination prevention, detection, and control are essential for the high-resolution space optical systems now in development or planned. In-depth studies have shown that contamination avoidance is feasible and enhances mission success.ReferencesSPIE 967: \"Stray Light and Contamination in Optical Systems.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings 17-19, August 1988.SPIE 1329: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control II.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering Proceedings, July 10-12, 1990.SPIE 1754: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control III.\" The International Society for Optical Engineering, Proceedings, July 23-24, 1992.SPIE 777: \"Optical System Contamination Effects, Measurement, Control.\" The International Society of Optical Engineering Proceedings, May 19-22, 1987.NASA SP-5076: \"Contamination Control Handbook.\" Technology Utilization Division, Office of Technology Utilization, NASA, 1969.MSFC-SPEC-1443: \"Outgassing Test for Non-Metallic Materials Associated with Sensitive Optical Surfaces in a Space Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, December 3, 1987.MSFC-SPEC-2223: \"Outgassing Test for Materials Associated with Sensitive Surfaces Used in an Ambient Environment.\" Materials and Processes Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, May 17, 1993.MSFC-STD-246: \"Standard Design and Operational Criteria for ControlledEnvironmental Areas.\" Rev.

    "driving_event": "This Lessons Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-EC-1110 from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefits:This practice ensures the performance reliability of optical fiber cable assemblies by requiring the selection of optical fiber cable components that have been tested and approved for spaceflight use and by specifying approved assembly and acceptance inspection and test procedures.Implementation:The termination of optical fiber cables used in spaceflight applications is performed in accordance with the GSFC approved training document, Ref. 1, which defines approved material requirements and detailed assembly techniques and procedures. Ref. 1 is used by engineers, senior technicians and those involved in training personnel in the techniques of terminating optical fiber cable. The procedures defined in the Ref. 1 training document are applicable to the following items from the MIL-STD-975 NASA Standard Electrical, Electronic, and Electromechanical Parts List, (NSPL), and the GSFC Preferred Parts List-20, (PPL-20):MIL-T-29504/4&5 Type II adhesiveOptical fiber termini manufactured by Amphenol/Bendix and used in MIL-C-38999 Series III connectorsOC-1008 optical fiber cables manufactured by Brand-RexThis procedure may not be applicable to other types of optical fiber cable and termini which may require different stripping techniques, polishing steps, tools, materials, and assembly instructions, all of which must be documented and controlled when spaceflight hardware is assembled.Personnel are cautioned about the use of parts from manufacturers not specified in the procedure as the use of those parts could result in unreliable cables. Other manufacturer's parts may be used, however, provided they are tested at GSFC, meet GSFC performance requirements, and are interchangeable with approved parts as determined by GSFC.Ref. 1 provides lists of approved materials required by the procedure including part numbers, manufacturer/source, and specifications. Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"",

Other manufacturer's parts may be used, however, provided they are tested at GSFC, meet GSFC performance requirements, and are interchangeable with approved parts as determined by GSFC.Ref. 1 provides lists of approved materials required by the procedure including part numbers, manufacturer/source, and specifications. Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"",

Also included is a list of equipment required by the procedure including model/part number and manufacturer or source.The assembly of an optical terminus onto an optical fiber cable is performed in the following four steps:Step 1- Equipment Parts, Preparation and Pre-cleaningThis step ensures that all tools, materials, and equipment are checked against required part numbers, labeled, calibrated, and cleaned as required. The cleanliness of all parts which come in contact with the adhesive is critical to a reliable bond and end product. All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"",

All parts which come in contact with the adhesive, including all dispenser parts and mixing pans, as well as the fiber and connector to be bonded, must be thoroughly cleaned with appropriate solvents before bonding. Note that some dispensers used for medical applications are internally coated with silicone for ease of dispensing. Silicone can mix with the adhesive and produce an unreliable bond. After cleaning is performed, care must be taken not to re-contaminate cleaned items by inadvertent contact with dirty surfaces. Also, equipment and setup information, tool part numbers, material lot numbers and other data are recorded in the certification logs in order to provide traceability in the event of problems.Step 2- Optical Fiber Cable Preparation and StrippingThe optical fiber outer jacket, strength member, inner jacket, and fiber coating components are prepared for the bonding process by stripping and cleaning and are inspected for correct stripping dimensions before bonding. Cracks, nicks, cuts, excessive chemical strip wicking, or other potential damage to cable components including the fiber and the strength member are inspected after stripping and prior to bonding in accordance with an in-process inspection criteria. Required data including acceptance inspection is recorded in the certification log. Chemical stripping is used to remove the acrylate fiber coating since the fiber can be nicked inadvertently even by trained operators when mechanical stripping is used. Nicks in the fiber are very difficult to detect, and an undetected nick could result in a latent defect which may not become apparent for a considerable length of time.Chemical stripping solutions as well as other chemicals or materials may be limited life items (i.e., their potency may be reduced over time) and are marked, controlled, and handled to ensure that expired chemicals are not used for assembly of spaceflight hardware.Step 3- Terminus To Cable BondingThe optical fiber cable is bonded to the terminus and the excess glass fiber is cleaved in preparation for terminus polishing. Care is exercised to ensure that the temperature-controlled ovens are stabilized at the required temperatures, the stripped cable ends are clean, and that the epoxy does not spill out onto any parts of the terminus except the rear barrel.Cleanliness is critical to a reliable bond and end product.Mixed adhesive systems are degassed (i.e., by use of a centrifuge) before they are applied to optical fibers and connectors to minimize the potential for fiber breakage due to bubbles or voids in the adhesive surrounding the fiber.The proper weighting, mixing, and curing of adhesive systems are critical to a reliable product. Detailed instructions on weighting proportions and tolerances, number of mixing cycles or mixing time, and cure time and temperature with time and temperature tolerances (cure schedule) are included in the engineering documentation.The pot life or working life of an adhesive is determined as a function of temperature. The engineering documentation includes requirements for the adhesive's shortest pot life or working life for the temperature range specified during adhesive application.After connector bonding, inspection criteria is defined in the engineering documentation for the fiber and cable as well as the connector to ensure reliable connectorization.Data such as adhesive lot numbers, room temperature and humidity, and pot life are recorded in the certification log for traceability in the event of problems with the adhesive. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesive used to bond an optical fiber to an optical connect, contact, substrate, or other piece part is at least 10 degrees C greater than the maximum temperature that the optical assembly will be subjected to, including test and storage temperatures. The Tg of an optical fiber adhesive is controlled to minimize optical performance variations caused by the potential movement of the bonded fiber within the optical assembly after temperature cycling.Step 4- Bonded Terminus PolishingPolishing of a terminus bonded to a cable is accomplished in three stages; course hand polishing and a two step machine fine polishing procedure. Refer to the polishing procedures in Ref. 1.The connector assembly is inspected for excess adhesive on the fiber endface and other parts of the connector, as defined in the engineering documentation, which could interfere with proper operation of the connector. Excessive adhesive on the connector endface can flake off over time and create contamination which can affect performance. Excess adhesive on other connector parts can prevent springs and other mechanisms from operating properly or fitting properly together.The optical fiber is back-lit using a flashlight from the opposite end of the cable assembly without touching the fiber when inspecting a finished fiber optic connector for cracks in the fiber.The polishing process produces a \"flat\" polish and the use of an interferometer is recommended to measure the profile of a fiber endface. The amount of fiber protrusion and the amount of fiber undercut is specified in the engineering documentation.Physical contact connectors, angle polished connectors, or other specialized polished endfaces have specific requirements for endface finishing. The amount of fiber protrusion, amount of fiber undercut, connector endface geometry parameters and tolerances, such as flatness, radius of curvature, vertex offset, or angle, as a minimum, are specified in the engineering documentation.Final Polish VerificationVisual examination of the polished, bonded terminus is performed to ensure that the finished termination is of high optical quality and free of unacceptable defects, such as chips, contamination, cracks, scratches, pits, or hackles. A 200X hand held microscope is used and because of the high magnification, the microscope lens and terminus adapter and the polished terminus must be clean. Loose debris or dust is removed by using dry nitrogen. Care is used to insure that lenses of the microscope and the polished terminus are not scratched. Cleaning and inspection is accomplished in accordance with the step by step procedures of Ref. 1.Acceptance CriteriaThe following define the acceptance criteria:The terminus must have a smoothly polished face and glass fiber free of visible scratches and imperfections which affect optical performance or reliability.No visible scratches on the terminus ceramic face.No fiber edge chips, scratches, pits, or hackles.No contamination.No fiber cracks or cracks anywhere in the ceramic ferrule.No excess epoxy around the fiber or spots of apoxy anywhere on the ceramic face.Optical Performance VerificationThe optical fiber cable has been terminated on both ends and conforms with all acceptance criteria up to this point. Optical performance verification is performed by conducting a power loss measurement in accordance with a test setup and the procedure defined in Ref. 1. The first step is to perform power loss measurements without the optical fiber cable in the test setup to establish reference measurement values. The second step is to insert the cable to be verified into the test setup without changing anything else in the test setup and repeating the power loss measurement. The difference in the two power loss measurements, is the power loss of the optical fiber cable.Power Loss Acceptance CriteriaPower losses of -1.0 dB per terminus or -2.0 dB per cable is the acceptable value for the two termini of each completed cable. In addition acceptable cable length losses for cables less than 34 feet long is 0.1 dB. Acceptable cable length losses for cables longer than 34 feet are based on -0.003 dB per foot of cable length.Cables that fail the power loss acceptance criteria may be repaired by cleaning or additional fine polishing of an terminus or by replacement of a defective terminus if the cable length permits replacement of a terminus.Connector InstallationA terminated optical fiber cable is installed into a MIL-C-38999 connector before it is used in a spacecraft harness assembly. The optical fiber terminus is installed into the connector in the same way that a wire contact is installed. Care is exercised to ensure that the termini ends are not touched, contaminated, or scratched during installation. Standard contact extraction tools for the MIL-C-38999 connector are used if the termini are to be removed from the connector. Mechanical strain relief backshells are used as appropriate. Socket termini have springs which allow for movement inside a connector when optical termini are mated together. Care is exercised to ensure that the strain relief allows for a slight movement of all socket termini cables in the harness.Optical fiber cable connector terminations are inspected and cleaned if necessary before each mate. Under no circumstances are 100 mate and demate cycles exceeded without cleaning the fiber optical termination to ensure consistent optical performance.Dust caps which are non-outgassing in laboratory or room environments are used as covers for optical assemblies. Vinyl dust covers are not used.Technical Rationale:The use of components, materials, and techniques used in the fabrication of optical fiber cables that have not been tested and approved for spaceflight use could result in significant loss of performance during the mission. Outgassing of contaminates in space can be a serious problem with optical fiber systems. Also, space radiation can cause significant loss in performance of certain optical fibers. Nicks in the small and fragile glass fiber can result in latent optical defects and failures.References:GSFC Document No. 733-FO-29504-TERM-TRAINING Entitled \"Optical Fiber Cable Termination Procedures For Spaceflight Applications Using MIL-T-29504 Optical Fiber Termini\"",

If the high predicted levels turn out to be a problem, the early identification allows time to develop a solution.Implementation Method:Perform a comprehensive survey of the mission environments and payload characteristics, then determine the possible sources of plasma generated noise. If the source of plasma noise is from the natural occurring space plasma or arises from the motion of a spacecraft through the earth's geomagnetic field, the radiated susceptibility (RS03) test levels specified in MIL-STD-461C will be adequate. The magnitude of plasma waves in the natural space environment is usually limited by the thermal energy of the ambient plasma. Due to the low plasma densities of the earth and other planets, the energy content of the naturally occurring space plasma is relatively low. It can easily be shown that the MIL-STD-461C radiated susceptibility RS03 limits are adequate to demonstrate a spacecraft's immunity to EMI generated by natural plasma noise.The RS03 specifications are:Frequency Range E-Field (Volts/meter)14 kHz to 30 MHz1030 MHz to 10 GHz5Above 10 GHz20For large conducting structures moving across the geomagnetic field, additional plasma noise is generated as a result of wave emission due to the motion induced VxB electric field. In low earth orbit, the noise level generated by a typical space station structure is estimated to be 10-3 V/m per ampere current (ref. 1) and that of a tethered satellite system is 10-1 V/m (ref. 2). Since the typical current flow for the space station and the tethered satellite is less than 1 Amp, the electric field generated by motion of a space structure will also be enveloped by the MIL-STD-461C RS03 limits.Plasma can also cause structure current (conducted emission) to flow in the spacecraft. In the absence of any externally induced events, the net current to the spacecraft structure is always zero. When the spacecraft goes in and out of eclipse, a transient current would be induced on the spacecraft structure. Since the time scale of this type of transition is relatively long, on the order of seconds, and the current involved is the plasma current that can be collected by a spacecraft (which is on the order of 0.1A), this transient current will not be a EMI source of any concern.Technical Rationale:Electron beam experiments can generate high levels of conducted and radiated EMI. When an electron beam is injected into the plasma from a spacecraft, a return current must be present in order for the current loop to be completed. The rise time of this return current is determined by the transit time of thermal electrons through the sheath surrounding the spacecraft. This time scale is >0.1 ms (ref. 3 and 4). The upper bound value of the peak return current is given by the peak injected electron beam current. Therefore, the dI/dt of the structure current will be in the range of 108 A/s (assuming a peak current of 10 Amp). For programs that have tests to demonstrate immunity against lightning or ESD inducted structure current, the dI/dt of those test specifications are usually >104 A/ms and thus they envelope the dI/dt induced by electron beam. For a program that has no test specifications for structure current, it should be added to the EMC program if an electron beam experiment is on-board. This is particularly important when the beam current exceeds 10 Amp.The injected electron beam also generates large amplitude waves in the ambient plasma (ref. 5). A comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the maximum amplitude of the beam generated plasma noise. This analysis involves an estimate of the conversion efficiency of the beam energy into electromagnetic wave energy. Usually this conversion efficiency has an upper bound value of 1% (ref. 6). Once the amplitude of the EMI produced by beam generated waves has been determined, the adequacy of the MIL-STD-461C RS03 specifications can be evaluated. Similar approaches can be applied to determine the EMI resulting from the interaction of an ion engine plume and the ambient plasma.References:Hastings, D. and Wang J.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-EC-1106; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefits:Potential EMI sources are identified in time so that appropriate measures can be incorporated into the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) program. If the high predicted levels turn out to be a problem, the early identification allows time to develop a solution.Implementation Method:Perform a comprehensive survey of the mission environments and payload characteristics, then determine the possible sources of plasma generated noise. If the source of plasma noise is from the natural occurring space plasma or arises from the motion of a spacecraft through the earth's geomagnetic field, the radiated susceptibility (RS03) test levels specified in MIL-STD-461C will be adequate. The magnitude of plasma waves in the natural space environment is usually limited by the thermal energy of the ambient plasma. Due to the low plasma densities of the earth and other planets, the energy content of the naturally occurring space plasma is relatively low. It can easily be shown that the MIL-STD-461C radiated susceptibility RS03 limits are adequate to demonstrate a spacecraft's immunity to EMI generated by natural plasma noise.The RS03 specifications are:Frequency Range E-Field (Volts/meter)14 kHz to 30 MHz1030 MHz to 10 GHz5Above 10 GHz20For large conducting structures moving across the geomagnetic field, additional plasma noise is generated as a result of wave emission due to the motion induced VxB electric field. In low earth orbit, the noise level generated by a typical space station structure is estimated to be 10-3 V/m per ampere current (ref. 1) and that of a tethered satellite system is 10-1 V/m (ref. 2). Since the typical current flow for the space station and the tethered satellite is less than 1 Amp, the electric field generated by motion of a space structure will also be enveloped by the MIL-STD-461C RS03 limits.Plasma can also cause structure current (conducted emission) to flow in the spacecraft. In the absence of any externally induced events, the net current to the spacecraft structure is always zero. When the spacecraft goes in and out of eclipse, a transient current would be induced on the spacecraft structure. Since the time scale of this type of transition is relatively long, on the order of seconds, and the current involved is the plasma current that can be collected by a spacecraft (which is on the order of 0.1A), this transient current will not be a EMI source of any concern.Technical Rationale:Electron beam experiments can generate high levels of conducted and radiated EMI. When an electron beam is injected into the plasma from a spacecraft, a return current must be present in order for the current loop to be completed. The rise time of this return current is determined by the transit time of thermal electrons through the sheath surrounding the spacecraft. This time scale is >0.1 ms (ref. 3 and 4). The upper bound value of the peak return current is given by the peak injected electron beam current. Therefore, the dI/dt of the structure current will be in the range of 108 A/s (assuming a peak current of 10 Amp). For programs that have tests to demonstrate immunity against lightning or ESD inducted structure current, the dI/dt of those test specifications are usually >104 A/ms and thus they envelope the dI/dt induced by electron beam. For a program that has no test specifications for structure current, it should be added to the EMC program if an electron beam experiment is on-board. This is particularly important when the beam current exceeds 10 Amp.The injected electron beam also generates large amplitude waves in the ambient plasma (ref. 5). A comprehensive analysis is needed to determine the maximum amplitude of the beam generated plasma noise. This analysis involves an estimate of the conversion efficiency of the beam energy into electromagnetic wave energy. Usually this conversion efficiency has an upper bound value of 1% (ref. 6). Once the amplitude of the EMI produced by beam generated waves has been determined, the adequacy of the MIL-STD-461C RS03 specifications can be evaluated. Similar approaches can be applied to determine the EMI resulting from the interaction of an ion engine plume and the ambient plasma.References:Hastings, D. and Wang J.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1257; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Proper design of solid rocket motor case-to-case field joints reduces joint rotation and potential leakage during ignition and operation. With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable \"o\"-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments.Implementation Method:1. BackgroundThe Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes.2. Case-to-Case Field Joint ImprovementsSpace Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1.The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a \"capture\" feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the \"tang\" on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.References360L001 Acceptance Review: Morton Thiokol, Inc.

This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system. The critical parameters associated with the case-to-case field joint, case-to-case factory joint, case-to-nozzle joint, and ignition system mounting joints continue to be closely monitored on a flight-to-flight basis to prevent the occurrence of undesirable hot gas transmission through any of the multiple seals provided.References360L001 Acceptance Review: Morton Thiokol, Inc.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1257; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Proper design of solid rocket motor case-to-case field joints reduces joint rotation and potential leakage during ignition and operation. With detailed dynamic loads analyses, thermal analyses, careful insulation design, and suitable \"o\"-ring sealing, the leakage of hot combustion gasses through field joints is eliminated. This prevents potentially catastrophic burning or melting of the solid rocket motor and adjacent metal components. Similar benefits are obtained by using improved design practices for case-to-nozzle joints and factory joints between case segments.Implementation Method:1. BackgroundThe Challenger accident (Space Shuttle Flight #51L) which was caused by the escape of hot gasses from case-to-case field joints in the SRM, triggered an in-depth, detailed review of analytical, design, manufacturing, assembly, and testing methods for solid rocket motor field and factory assembly joints. The case-to-case field joint was the primary target of the investigations and subsequent redesign efforts. However, other joints in the motor such as the case-to-nozzle joint and the factory joint between motor segments were thoroughly investigated and redesigned when the investigation allowed for optimization of the noted configurations. Reliable joint performance was achieved by a detailed review of the design drives and by comprehensive analysis, test, and redesign processes.2. Case-to-Case Field Joint ImprovementsSpace Shuttle Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRMs) are made up of four segments in which propellant is cast in monolithic form. The four segments are connected by the field joint shown in cross-section on Figure 1.The case portion of each segment consists of two cylinders connected in the center by a factory joint. A dynamic launch and flight load analysis confirmed that the field joint design, which has been the main focus of attention, needed to be modified after the Challenger accident to incorporate several improvements. The most significant of these improvements was the addition of a \"capture\" feature, which is essentially an added circumferential band that is incorporated as an integral part of the \"tang\" on the male side of the three case-to-case field joints. This capture feature creates an interference fit with the inner clevis surface and restricts the movement of the tang away from the two \"o\"-rings on the internal leg of the field joints during initial motor pressurization. The capture feature also incorporates a third \"o\"-ring which potentially serves as a heat barrier to the combustion process, in event of anomalous insulation performance. In addition to the change in the metal parts, the configuration of the internal insulation interface between adjacent segments was changed to permit an interference fit between adjoining insulation elements. This insulation joint is bonded with a pressure sensitive adhesive around its full circumference, and aided in its contact during motor operation with a circumferential \"J\" shaped pressurizing slot in the tang insulation. With the addition of the capture feature and its \"o\"-ring, a second leak check port, which also serves as a vent during assembly and a means of positioning of the primary \"o\"-ring, was added in the redesigned joint. This ensured that a redundant seal existed in the new design. A \"V-2\" fluorocarbon filler material was placed at the clevis tip between the primary and tang \"o\"-rings to reduce the free volume of the joint and limit the quantity of hot gas that would enter the joint in the event of leakage of the \"J\" seal and capture feature \"o\"-ring.In the new design, the inner clevis leg surface is machined to provide a sealing surface for the capture feature \"o\"-ring. The compression of both the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings was increased by increasing the \"o\"-ring diameter by 0.010 inch from the pre-Challenger configuration, and the \"o\"-ring grooves were widened by 0.005 inch to prevent four wall contact by the \"o\"-ring. All sealing surfaces were smoothed to an average roughness of 63 micro inches (63 millionths of an inch). A chamfered clevis leg was provided to aid in the assembly process. Each field joint in the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor is connected by pins (a cross sectional drawing of one of these pins appears on Figure 1). A key reliability enhancement feature is an increased-length pin with a circumferential pin retainer band. Each pin includes a hole which assists in assembly, and an opening with a dovetail cross-section to assist in pin extraction for refurbishment after flight. The increased pin length causes the dovetail to lie outboard at the outer clevis leg outside diameter. A stress analysis confirmed that this would reduce unit area shear stress on the pin because the dovetail is outside of the high shear area. This modification eliminated the potential for pin deformation. Custom shims were inserted between the inside surface of the outer clevis leg and the outside surface of the tang to maintain a constant gap between the two surfaces and to limit the growth of the metal-to-metal gap at the primary and secondary \"o\"-rings during pressurization.[D]3. Case-to-Nozzle Joint ImprovementsConcurrent with the improvements in the case-to-case field joints, case-to-nozzle joints were also improved to obtain higher reliability and to achieve a more robust design. Changes to the insulation configuration, joint adhesive material, \"o\"-ring and \"o\"-ring groove configurations, and the nozzle attachment fasteners provide positive assurance of sealing. As in the instance of the insulation surrounding the case-to-case field joints, a pressurizing slot in the case insulation, coupled with a layer of sealant between the case and nozzle insulation, provides protection against combustion gasses reaching the nozzle or case metal parts. A circumferential slot is located in the case insulation near the interface between the case and nozzle insulation. A circumferential flow baffle is installed in this slot to prevent erosion of the insulation, and a stress-relieving radius former is included at the base of this slot to prevent cracking. To provide an additional margin for reliability, polysulfide adhesive material is used to bond the carbon phenolic nozzle insulation material to the asbestos/silica-filled, nitrile butadiene rubber insulation in the rocket motor case.A wiper \"o\"-ring in the glass phenolic layer of the nozzle insulation and wiper vent slot in the rubber case insulation were incorporated to prevent entrapment of air in the case-to-nozzle joint during assembly, and to prevent the polysulfide adhesive from contaminating the primary \"o\"-ring. The wiper \"o\"-ring also provided the second of two barriers (the first is the polysulfide material in the insulation joint) to inhibit gas flow to the primary seal. Stress analysis studies and strength testing proved that radial bolts, as well as longitudinal bolts, were required to ensure an impenetrable seal between the nozzle and case metal parts under all environmental and motor performance conditions. Radial bolts ensure that sufficient compression of the primary \"o\"-ring is maintained to provide effective sealing. Increasing the diameter of the \"o\"-ring and redimensioning the \"o\"-ring groove to provide optimum \"o\"-ring squeeze while preventing \"o\"-ring entrapment were required reliability enhancement measures in the RSRM case-to-nozzle joint.4. Factory Case-to-Case JointsCustom shims, widened \"o\"-ring grooves, slightly larger \"o\"-rings, increased pin length, and revised pin retainer bands were improvements made in the factory case-to-case joints. Because of the continuous insulation and propellant strata over the factory joints, special joint provisions were not required in the insulation. Clevis legs were chamfered and undercut at the leg tips for consistent final configurations after assembly.Technical Rationale:Based on detailed analyses of key design and manufacturing/assembly drivers, the SRM case-to-case field joints have exhibited satisfactory performance in close to 100 solid rocket motors since the Challenger accident without evidence of hot propellant gas leakage through the insulation to the joint sealing system.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice No. PD-ED-1251; from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, NASA Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefit:The benefits of implementing these reliability practices for instrumentation system and related sensors are: (1) consistent performance and measurement results, (2) minimum need for continuous or periodic calibration, (3) avoidance of and resistance to contamination, and (4) reduced necessity for repair or replacement in repeated usage.Implementation Method:Introduction:Close attention to design details, precision craftsmanship, and an integrated approach to design, manufacturing, testing, installation, and operations are paramount to sustained accuracy and reliability of performance in launch vehicle and propulsion system instrumentation and related sensors for aerospace applications. Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts. Leak checks are performed on all sensor welds.Manufacturing and Assembly Practices:Closely controlled manufacturing and routing procedures have proven to be essential in the manufacturing and assembly of sensors as well as the installation and testing of instrumentation systems. Inspection points are added during pre-assembly or partial assembly steps if inspection would be difficult at later steps in the process. Inspection steps are added prior to any cavity closeout, and prior to the use of coatings, sealants, or potting compounds that could mask contaminants. Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed. Heat sinks are provided in tooling for electron-beam weld joints. High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data. Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone. These design and process changes implemented many of the practices described in this document, and a much higher reliability of the resulting modified sensor is expected. The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.",

Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed. Heat sinks are provided in tooling for electron-beam weld joints. High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data. Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone. These design and process changes implemented many of the practices described in this document, and a much higher reliability of the resulting modified sensor is expected. The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.",

Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts.

Each Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) contributes 66 more channels of telemetered data, making a total of 466 channels of telemetered data for the reusable propulsion system components of the Space Shuttle.In the Critical Design Review of the SSME pressure sensor, which is only one of the many sensors used in a Space Shuttle flight, fourteen design changes and a number of process changes were identified to reduce contamination and to improve the reliability of this sensor alone. These design and process changes implemented many of the practices described in this document, and a much higher reliability of the resulting modified sensor is expected. The changes involved sensor body, wiring, potting materials, manufacturing methods, a slightly revised configuration, increased strength, and improved inspectability.References:Solid Rocket Booster Instrumentation Program and Components List, Report No. 16A00103, Marshall Space Flight Center, AL, March 15, 1983.SSME Flight Measurement Location Document, Revision D, Rockwell International, Rocketdyne Division, Canoga Park, CA, May 1991.Critical Design Review of Eaton SSME Pressure Transducer, Rockwell Aerospace, January 31, 1995.Space Station Furnace Facility Metrology Plan, NASA/MSFC Astrionics Laboratory, November 1994.\"Long Life Assurance Study for Manned Spacecraft Long Life Hardware,\" Report # MCR-72-169, Martin Marietta Corporation, September 1972.",

Instrumentation systems and their related sensors have reached a high degree of maturity, and preferred practices have evolved in recent years which will ensure high reliability if meticulously followed throughout the life cycle of the instrumentation system.Design Practices:During the preliminary design, critical design review, and initial development phases, the integrated design and concurrent engineering processes have proven to be essential in producing instrumentation that will continue to perform reliably in repeated and long term usage. Instrumentation systems should be planned and designed in close connection with and parallel with the design and analysis of the principal systems and subsystems they are intended to monitor, measure, and control. Sensor vendors and suppliers must be an integral part of the design team for effective coordination and communication. Error budget analyses and metrology considerations are considered up front in the design process. Designing the instrumentation system and its components for contamination-free manufacturability and ease of inspectability is vital. Calibration considerations and compensation methods are developed early in the design process to permit analysis of sensor shift and drift, and to provide a means of predicting and adjusting for both anticipated and unanticipated variances from nominal sensor performance. Sensors, connectors, and wiring are designed to avoid the potential of contamination creation or entrapment, damage during removal and refurbishment, misidentification, leakage, solder wire fatigue failure, electrical shorts, insulation breakdown, or vibration-induced deterioration.Testing and Verification Practices:Careful analysis of all instrumentation system design requirements and development of comprehensive test and verification plans help ensure that all instrumentation requirements are thoroughly verified in testing. For manned missions, continued testing and retesting of sensors and other components on a sampling basis from each production lot is required to ensure that delivered parts are continuously meeting standards. Experience has shown that careful attention must be given to any rework processes, and that reworking of lead wire channels should be avoided. Source control drawings are established to ensure that manufactured items conform exactly to those of the qualified parts. Leak checks are performed on all sensor welds.Manufacturing and Assembly Practices:Closely controlled manufacturing and routing procedures have proven to be essential in the manufacturing and assembly of sensors as well as the installation and testing of instrumentation systems. Inspection points are added during pre-assembly or partial assembly steps if inspection would be difficult at later steps in the process. Inspection steps are added prior to any cavity closeout, and prior to the use of coatings, sealants, or potting compounds that could mask contaminants. Potting compounds for connector terminals, printed wiring boards, or connector boards are formulated, installed, and inspected to eliminate voids and potential resulting failure in a dynamic vibration environment. Inspection for contamination is conducted following secondary machining operations and prior to the assembly of machined parts. Magnification is specified for all inspection operations during manufacturing and assembly. Handling containers, tooling, and support equipment that will come into close contact with the flight hardware is meticulously cleaned and closely controlled during manufacturing and assembly.Alternate rework procedures are evaluated and acceptance or rejection criteria for these rework procedures are developed. Heat sinks are provided in tooling for electron-beam weld joints. High temperature solder is used to improve strength under elevated temperature environments.Changes to Instrumentation Systems and Sensors:Changes to instrumentation systems and sensors are subjected to certification through analysis, by similarity, through laboratory verification, and by hot fire testing on the selected launch vehicle, propulsion system, or component. A stress analysis accompanies any change in configuration to ensure that the resultant component or system is at least as strong, if not stronger, than the original.Resulting improvements in material properties, reduction in weight, and improvement in reliability are verified through analysis. A dynamic evaluation of modified configurations is conducted to identify changes in resonant frequency and load capability. Verification of changes by similarity is based on hot fire experience of sensors or other instrumentation system components with identical features. Laboratory testing to verify changes includes verification of diaphragm burst pressures (pressure sensors, for example), case structure burst pressures, and leak tests. Hot fire verification includes the testing of one sensor in each vibration zone (as in the SSME) and multiple long duration tests in each planned sensor location.General Practices for Instrumentation Sensors (Transducers) in Long Lifetime, Refurbishable or Reusable Vehicles:Selected pressure and temperature transducers are capable of lifetimes in excess of 10 years. Flow meters have less life capability, but meters without moving parts and operating in an environment of low contamination and corrosion are capable of long life. Humidity, oxygen, and carbon dioxide sensors are life limited, requiring periodic maintenance actions such as cleaning and replacement of cartridges.A prime problem with transducers is the lack of long-term stability (freedom from drift). One solution to this problem lies in making the total transducer dimensionally stable over long periods of time. Accordingly, it is important to minimize the use of nonmetallic materials and to employ and control processes that yield parts in a stress free condition. Long term stability (and process control) must then be demonstrated through testing of the assembled transducer under appropriate environmental conditions such as temperature cycling. A second solution is to provide sensitive and pre-calibrated ground-based software that will detect unpredictable sensor drift and adjust the software to compensate for this drift where possible. However, this process can yield an increased uncertainty of the measurement because the instrument, has in effect, been recalibrated through a process that could have less accuracy than the original calibration standard. If the reference drifts, this uncertainty grows with time. There is more to be gained from correction of unpredictable drift if a cross check can be performed with a statistically significant number of instruments. Cross checks are of great value for determining when an instrument has drifted outside the allowable tolerance band. When this occurs, the instrument can be replaced or calibrated as required by corrective maintenance.A well-constructed test program provides the best assurance that a transducer will perform satisfactorily in a long-life application. Unfortunately, the lead time available from selection of a transducer to commitment of the transducer to service may be only a fraction of the time required for a comprehensive test program. Therefore, transducers should be chosen where such data has already been acquired.Long-life transducer applications fall into two broad classifications: open-loop and closed-loop. Open-loop applications only provide information regarding the performance of a system. Closed-loop applications involve a control function to regulate a system based upon transducer output. Transducer failures in open-loop applications result in uncertainty about the condition of the system, while similar failures in closed-loop applications of transducers are more critical from the standpoint of failure effects. They require greater attention to the factors influencing reliability and life.In general, redundancy techniques do not provide solutions to transducer problems. Active redundancy cannot provide a solution if a known life limiting mechanism exists in the transducer. Multiple potentiometer wipers, for example, exposed to the same wear, may fail within the same time span. Standby redundancy is generally not feasible.In standby redundancy a non-active transducer is protected from the failure producing condition until the first transducer has failed. Applications involving standby redundancy are severely restricted by size, weight, and the complexity of devices required to switch from the active to the standby transducer.Technical Rationale:Each Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) has 65 measurements during flight to monitor parameters such as chamber pressure, actuator positions, temperature, and vibration. In addition to these measurements, there are 142 \u00ecevent\u00ee measurements that are telemetered back to earth for each SRB. Therefore, for each Space Shuttle flight, the SRB contributes over 400 channels of telemetered data.

    "subject": "Quantitative Reliability Requirements Used as Performance-Based Requirements for Space Systems",
    "abstract": "None",
    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice number PD-ED-1273, from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Benefit:Quantitative reliability requirements provide specific design goals and criteria for assuring that the system will meet the intended durability and life. Early in the design process, the system developer will be required to consider how the design will provide the requisite reliability characteristics and must provide analyses to verify that the delivered hardware will meet the requirements. Assessment of the early design's ability to meet quantitative reliability requirements will support design trades, component selection, and maintainability design, and help assure that appropriate material strengths are used as well as the appropriate levels and types of redundancy.Implementation Method:The missions and scientific objectives of the subject space system are used to define quantitative reliability goals and objectives. In general, the quantitative reliability goals and objectives are stated as requisite probabilities of achieving specific missions or scientific objectives under stated operating conditions and environments. The probability values specified as being required are established through a process of trading off a desire for very high value against the cost and design constraints of achieving that value. The specified level will also determine an accepted level of risk or likelihood that the mission objective will not be met. Very often, the acceptable level may be negotiated between the science community or user, the contractor, and the various responsible NASA organizations.The use of quantitative performance-based reliability requirements does not supersede or negate the need for specifying fault tolerance or other classical reliability requirements. Fault tolerance requirements and reliability design criteria should also be levied to ensure the proper separation of redundancy, and the avoidance of failure propagation. Quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that the operational performance and missions can be met with an accepted probability level or likelihood. Table 1 shows examples of several different types of quantitative reliability requirements that can be levied on a space hardware program. The importance of using both types of requirements lies in the need to ensure that the system design is as robust as necessary and that it meets the verifiable performance goal. These types of requirements, if utilized correctly, will work hand in hand to provide the contractor direction on developing a more reliable product. The quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that operational needs can be met based on pre-set conditions.[D]Table 1: Examples of Quantitative Reliability RequirementsA quantitative reliability requirement by definition means that the reliability is expressed in a measurable quantity. Performance-based reliability requirements are generally stated in terms of the probability of properly performing a mission phase or objective without a failure (or sequence of failures) that will terminate the mission phase. An example is the International Space Station reliability requirement in SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS).\" The reliability requirement in SSP 41000 states that the Space Station shall provide an operational capability to provide a microgravity environment for 50 percent of the internal payload locations for at least 180 days per year in continuous periods of no less than 30 days with a reliability of 0.80 or better. This requirement holds the ISS prime contractor responsible for providing a vehicle design that will operate continuously for 30 days without suffering a system failure that would exceed the conditions necessary for microgravity science, and do so at least 4 out of 5 of the periods. The system reliability, given its associated components and redundancy configuration, can be measured against that quantitative requirement. Also, during design reviews, consideration must be given to reliability assessments of the design because of such requirements, thus heightening the awareness of program risks that may otherwise go uncovered.Other requirement statements might relate to the launch phase of a space system or simply to the normal operation phase. However, the specific elements of the requirement statement include the description of the desired performance, usually a direct or indirect reference to the amount of time involved, and the probability value needed. The mission/objective specified in a reliability requirement may deal with a major portion of the entire mission or may be a very specific portion of the mission. For instance, a reliability requirement may be specified for the ability to maintain attitude or perform a significant mission event.The specification values used for the reliability requirement depends on the criticality of the mission or objective and the consequences of failure. In the Space Station case, loss of the microgravity capability is not inherently catastrophic, and a repair capability is available. Four successful 30-day periods out of five was considered to be reasonably achievable, and was deemed to be acceptable to the scientific user community. In man-rated vehicles, determining an acceptable value for the likelihood of mission success (hence loss of mission) may be more difficult. However, specifications for the reliability may then address the probability of avoiding mission aborts or loss of function. An example might be \"the item shall perform its functions during the launch phase without losing any of the defined capabilities or functions with a probability of 0.98.\" The Federal Aviation Administration relates the consequence of failure and the probability of its occurrence in its consideration of risk, and is shown in Figure 1. By defining quantitative reliability requirements as those involving failure events throughout a flight leading to emergency procedures or immediate landings (mission aborts), the quantitative values for commercial vehicles would be specified in the 0.999 to 0.99999 range, (or conversely 1 out of a thousand to 1 out of 100 thousand).[D]Figure 1: An Illustration of the Relationship Between Consequence of Failure and the Probability of Its Occurrence (FAA, Updated)In non-man rated vehicles or systems, the emphasis is on specifying a requirement that is sufficient to ensure a high likelihood of mission success, but not so high as to drive cost and weight beyond reasonable bounds. The use of function and item redundancy for increasing the likelihood of mission success will likely be necessary to meet high quantitative reliability specifications, but redundancy can also add significant program costs. Again, trade studies may be necessary to balance requirements for the likelihood of meeting a mission objective against the reliability achieved with current manufacturing technologies and against various design options. For instance, it would be extremely difficult at current technology levels to meet a 0.999 reliability on a lengthy mission of high complexity without the use of functional redundancy. For quick-development, highly cost-restrictive programs with limited objectives, a performance-based reliability requirement of 0.9 or less may be appropriate to keep the acquisition costs within bounds.To verify the fulfillment of a quantitative requirement, reliability analysis such as reliability block diagram analysis (RBDA) is used. The attribute of reliability, by definition, lies in the probabilistic realm while most performance attributes or parameters such as temperature, speed, thrust, voltage, or material strength contain more deterministic characteristics. Within the accuracy of the measuring devices, one can directly measure performance attributes in the deterministic realm to verify compliance with requirements. No such measuring device exists for probabilistic parameters like reliability; it is usually estimated through comparison to similar components or systems through inference, analysis, and the use of statistics. Verification that quantitative requirements have been met also provides answers to questions such as \"how reliable is this system?\"[D]Table 2: Quantitative Reliability Requirement Verification TechniquesA reliability requirement specified without a probability value such as \"the vehicle shall perform xyz mission on-orbit without failure for 5 years\" is impossible to verify during qualification or acceptance testing. The likelihood, or probability, that the requirement will be met is assessable, and this activity is inherently equivalent to assessing the reliability. Without quantitative requirements, it is left to the certification assessor to evaluate an estimate of the probability of success and to decide if that is sufficient, which places the risk on the program.A great deal of preliminary analysis may be necessary in the requirement specification process that considers the capability of the technology to various levels of reliability. This preliminary analysis helps avoid setting quantitative requirements too high or too low. Development of quantitative reliability requirements must represent a balance between the operational performance requirements of the system and the ability to restore and maintain the system through maintenance and sparing.Establishment of quantitative requirements as high as possible is necessary to maximize the probability that the system will complete the mission without failure. However, achieving high reliability or probability of mission success increases cost by generally requiring redundant equipment and fail-safe devices as well as high margins of safety in the material properties used. Thus, meeting unrealistic and unnecessary reliability requirements can lead to program weight and volume problems as well as cost inflation Based on the stress-strength concept of failure, perfect reliability could be achieved by building a system whose strength is greater than any conceivable stress put on the system. In reality, weight, volume, and cost constraints usually limit the strength of the design. Although perfect reliability from space systems cannot be expected, consideration of the needs of the operational community as well as the budget of the program will help in determining a requirement level. Also, if reliability goals are not met, it may be necessary to initiate a reliability growth scenario in which failure modes are analyzed and designed out of the system. This may or may not cost the program extra money, as reliability growth testing may not have been part of the original life cycle plan.As mentioned above, the International Space Station Program has levied a quantitative performance requirement on the Prime Contractor. Arrival at that requirement came through rigorous coordination with operational elements of the program, including the Mission Operations Directorate and the Science and Utilization community. The actual benchmark of 0.8 was derived from analysis of the operational needs of the program, the number of failures that could be tolerated, and an early analysis of what the space station design concept could provide. This number was a mutual agreement between the product assurance community and the operations community. As a result of this requirement, the prime is undergoing an effort as part of it\u00eds reliability group to maintain a running tally of the overall station reliability via reliability block diagram analysis. Every design change, program change, or other input is reflected in the running tally to ensure that the design meets the requirement.Technical Rationale:Many previous NASA program development efforts have relied on specific design requirements such as redundancy to minimize risk and the likelihood of failure. Quantitative reliability requirements augment qualitative reliability analysis such as failure tolerance, but more importantly, gives teeth to a requirement that may otherwise slip from the design. Designers and contractors are held responsible for designing systems and to demonstrate analytically that the system or function will have a sufficient likelihood of failure-free mission operations.References:SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS),\" November 1, 1994, Contract NAS15-10000.NASA Risk Management Program Tools and Techniques Handbook, Draft, July 1988, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.NASA Safety Risk Management Program Plan, Sections 1-5, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.Reliability Preferred Practice PD-AP-1313, \"System Reliability Assessment Using Block Diagramming Methods.\"",

Early in the design process, the system developer will be required to consider how the design will provide the requisite reliability characteristics and must provide analyses to verify that the delivered hardware will meet the requirements. Assessment of the early design's ability to meet quantitative reliability requirements will support design trades, component selection, and maintainability design, and help assure that appropriate material strengths are used as well as the appropriate levels and types of redundancy.Implementation Method:The missions and scientific objectives of the subject space system are used to define quantitative reliability goals and objectives. In general, the quantitative reliability goals and objectives are stated as requisite probabilities of achieving specific missions or scientific objectives under stated operating conditions and environments. The probability values specified as being required are established through a process of trading off a desire for very high value against the cost and design constraints of achieving that value. The specified level will also determine an accepted level of risk or likelihood that the mission objective will not be met. Very often, the acceptable level may be negotiated between the science community or user, the contractor, and the various responsible NASA organizations.The use of quantitative performance-based reliability requirements does not supersede or negate the need for specifying fault tolerance or other classical reliability requirements. Fault tolerance requirements and reliability design criteria should also be levied to ensure the proper separation of redundancy, and the avoidance of failure propagation. Quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that the operational performance and missions can be met with an accepted probability level or likelihood. Table 1 shows examples of several different types of quantitative reliability requirements that can be levied on a space hardware program. The importance of using both types of requirements lies in the need to ensure that the system design is as robust as necessary and that it meets the verifiable performance goal. These types of requirements, if utilized correctly, will work hand in hand to provide the contractor direction on developing a more reliable product. The quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that operational needs can be met based on pre-set conditions.[D]Table 1: Examples of Quantitative Reliability RequirementsA quantitative reliability requirement by definition means that the reliability is expressed in a measurable quantity. Performance-based reliability requirements are generally stated in terms of the probability of properly performing a mission phase or objective without a failure (or sequence of failures) that will terminate the mission phase. An example is the International Space Station reliability requirement in SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS).\" The reliability requirement in SSP 41000 states that the Space Station shall provide an operational capability to provide a microgravity environment for 50 percent of the internal payload locations for at least 180 days per year in continuous periods of no less than 30 days with a reliability of 0.80 or better. This requirement holds the ISS prime contractor responsible for providing a vehicle design that will operate continuously for 30 days without suffering a system failure that would exceed the conditions necessary for microgravity science, and do so at least 4 out of 5 of the periods. The system reliability, given its associated components and redundancy configuration, can be measured against that quantitative requirement. Also, during design reviews, consideration must be given to reliability assessments of the design because of such requirements, thus heightening the awareness of program risks that may otherwise go uncovered.Other requirement statements might relate to the launch phase of a space system or simply to the normal operation phase. However, the specific elements of the requirement statement include the description of the desired performance, usually a direct or indirect reference to the amount of time involved, and the probability value needed. The mission/objective specified in a reliability requirement may deal with a major portion of the entire mission or may be a very specific portion of the mission. For instance, a reliability requirement may be specified for the ability to maintain attitude or perform a significant mission event.The specification values used for the reliability requirement depends on the criticality of the mission or objective and the consequences of failure. In the Space Station case, loss of the microgravity capability is not inherently catastrophic, and a repair capability is available. Four successful 30-day periods out of five was considered to be reasonably achievable, and was deemed to be acceptable to the scientific user community. In man-rated vehicles, determining an acceptable value for the likelihood of mission success (hence loss of mission) may be more difficult. However, specifications for the reliability may then address the probability of avoiding mission aborts or loss of function.

Within the accuracy of the measuring devices, one can directly measure performance attributes in the deterministic realm to verify compliance with requirements. No such measuring device exists for probabilistic parameters like reliability; it is usually estimated through comparison to similar components or systems through inference, analysis, and the use of statistics. Verification that quantitative requirements have been met also provides answers to questions such as \"how reliable is this system?\"[D]Table 2: Quantitative Reliability Requirement Verification TechniquesA reliability requirement specified without a probability value such as \"the vehicle shall perform xyz mission on-orbit without failure for 5 years\" is impossible to verify during qualification or acceptance testing. The likelihood, or probability, that the requirement will be met is assessable, and this activity is inherently equivalent to assessing the reliability. Without quantitative requirements, it is left to the certification assessor to evaluate an estimate of the probability of success and to decide if that is sufficient, which places the risk on the program.A great deal of preliminary analysis may be necessary in the requirement specification process that considers the capability of the technology to various levels of reliability. This preliminary analysis helps avoid setting quantitative requirements too high or too low. Development of quantitative reliability requirements must represent a balance between the operational performance requirements of the system and the ability to restore and maintain the system through maintenance and sparing.Establishment of quantitative requirements as high as possible is necessary to maximize the probability that the system will complete the mission without failure. However, achieving high reliability or probability of mission success increases cost by generally requiring redundant equipment and fail-safe devices as well as high margins of safety in the material properties used. Thus, meeting unrealistic and unnecessary reliability requirements can lead to program weight and volume problems as well as cost inflation Based on the stress-strength concept of failure, perfect reliability could be achieved by building a system whose strength is greater than any conceivable stress put on the system. In reality, weight, volume, and cost constraints usually limit the strength of the design. Although perfect reliability from space systems cannot be expected, consideration of the needs of the operational community as well as the budget of the program will help in determining a requirement level. Also, if reliability goals are not met, it may be necessary to initiate a reliability growth scenario in which failure modes are analyzed and designed out of the system. This may or may not cost the program extra money, as reliability growth testing may not have been part of the original life cycle plan.As mentioned above, the International Space Station Program has levied a quantitative performance requirement on the Prime Contractor. Arrival at that requirement came through rigorous coordination with operational elements of the program, including the Mission Operations Directorate and the Science and Utilization community. The actual benchmark of 0.8 was derived from analysis of the operational needs of the program, the number of failures that could be tolerated, and an early analysis of what the space station design concept could provide. This number was a mutual agreement between the product assurance community and the operations community. As a result of this requirement, the prime is undergoing an effort as part of it\u00eds reliability group to maintain a running tally of the overall station reliability via reliability block diagram analysis. Every design change, program change, or other input is reflected in the running tally to ensure that the design meets the requirement.Technical Rationale:Many previous NASA program development efforts have relied on specific design requirements such as redundancy to minimize risk and the likelihood of failure. Quantitative reliability requirements augment qualitative reliability analysis such as failure tolerance, but more importantly, gives teeth to a requirement that may otherwise slip from the design. Designers and contractors are held responsible for designing systems and to demonstrate analytically that the system or function will have a sufficient likelihood of failure-free mission operations.References:SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS),\" November 1, 1994, Contract NAS15-10000.NASA Risk Management Program Tools and Techniques Handbook, Draft, July 1988, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.NASA Safety Risk Management Program Plan, Sections 1-5, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.Reliability Preferred Practice PD-AP-1313, \"System Reliability Assessment Using Block Diagramming Methods.\"",

Early in the design process, the system developer will be required to consider how the design will provide the requisite reliability characteristics and must provide analyses to verify that the delivered hardware will meet the requirements. Assessment of the early design's ability to meet quantitative reliability requirements will support design trades, component selection, and maintainability design, and help assure that appropriate material strengths are used as well as the appropriate levels and types of redundancy.Implementation Method:The missions and scientific objectives of the subject space system are used to define quantitative reliability goals and objectives. In general, the quantitative reliability goals and objectives are stated as requisite probabilities of achieving specific missions or scientific objectives under stated operating conditions and environments. The probability values specified as being required are established through a process of trading off a desire for very high value against the cost and design constraints of achieving that value. The specified level will also determine an accepted level of risk or likelihood that the mission objective will not be met. Very often, the acceptable level may be negotiated between the science community or user, the contractor, and the various responsible NASA organizations.The use of quantitative performance-based reliability requirements does not supersede or negate the need for specifying fault tolerance or other classical reliability requirements. Fault tolerance requirements and reliability design criteria should also be levied to ensure the proper separation of redundancy, and the avoidance of failure propagation. Quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that the operational performance and missions can be met with an accepted probability level or likelihood. Table 1 shows examples of several different types of quantitative reliability requirements that can be levied on a space hardware program. The importance of using both types of requirements lies in the need to ensure that the system design is as robust as necessary and that it meets the verifiable performance goal. These types of requirements, if utilized correctly, will work hand in hand to provide the contractor direction on developing a more reliable product. The quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that operational needs can be met based on pre-set conditions.[D]Table 1: Examples of Quantitative Reliability RequirementsA quantitative reliability requirement by definition means that the reliability is expressed in a measurable quantity. Performance-based reliability requirements are generally stated in terms of the probability of properly performing a mission phase or objective without a failure (or sequence of failures) that will terminate the mission phase. An example is the International Space Station reliability requirement in SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS).\" The reliability requirement in SSP 41000 states that the Space Station shall provide an operational capability to provide a microgravity environment for 50 percent of the internal payload locations for at least 180 days per year in continuous periods of no less than 30 days with a reliability of 0.80 or better. This requirement holds the ISS prime contractor responsible for providing a vehicle design that will operate continuously for 30 days without suffering a system failure that would exceed the conditions necessary for microgravity science, and do so at least 4 out of 5 of the periods. The system reliability, given its associated components and redundancy configuration, can be measured against that quantitative requirement. Also, during design reviews, consideration must be given to reliability assessments of the design because of such requirements, thus heightening the awareness of program risks that may otherwise go uncovered.Other requirement statements might relate to the launch phase of a space system or simply to the normal operation phase. However, the specific elements of the requirement statement include the description of the desired performance, usually a direct or indirect reference to the amount of time involved, and the probability value needed. The mission/objective specified in a reliability requirement may deal with a major portion of the entire mission or may be a very specific portion of the mission. For instance, a reliability requirement may be specified for the ability to maintain attitude or perform a significant mission event.The specification values used for the reliability requirement depends on the criticality of the mission or objective and the consequences of failure. In the Space Station case, loss of the microgravity capability is not inherently catastrophic, and a repair capability is available. Four successful 30-day periods out of five was considered to be reasonably achievable, and was deemed to be acceptable to the scientific user community. In man-rated vehicles, determining an acceptable value for the likelihood of mission success (hence loss of mission) may be more difficult. However, specifications for the reliability may then address the probability of avoiding mission aborts or loss of function. An example might be \"the item shall perform its functions during the launch phase without losing any of the defined capabilities or functions with a probability of 0.98.\" The Federal Aviation Administration relates the consequence of failure and the probability of its occurrence in its consideration of risk, and is shown in Figure 1. By defining quantitative reliability requirements as those involving failure events throughout a flight leading to emergency procedures or immediate landings (mission aborts), the quantitative values for commercial vehicles would be specified in the 0.999 to 0.99999 range, (or conversely 1 out of a thousand to 1 out of 100 thousand).[D]Figure 1: An Illustration of the Relationship Between Consequence of Failure and the Probability of Its Occurrence (FAA, Updated)In non-man rated vehicles or systems, the emphasis is on specifying a requirement that is sufficient to ensure a high likelihood of mission success, but not so high as to drive cost and weight beyond reasonable bounds. The use of function and item redundancy for increasing the likelihood of mission success will likely be necessary to meet high quantitative reliability specifications, but redundancy can also add significant program costs. Again, trade studies may be necessary to balance requirements for the likelihood of meeting a mission objective against the reliability achieved with current manufacturing technologies and against various design options. For instance, it would be extremely difficult at current technology levels to meet a 0.999 reliability on a lengthy mission of high complexity without the use of functional redundancy. For quick-development, highly cost-restrictive programs with limited objectives, a performance-based reliability requirement of 0.9 or less may be appropriate to keep the acquisition costs within bounds.To verify the fulfillment of a quantitative requirement, reliability analysis such as reliability block diagram analysis (RBDA) is used.

Thus, meeting unrealistic and unnecessary reliability requirements can lead to program weight and volume problems as well as cost inflation Based on the stress-strength concept of failure, perfect reliability could be achieved by building a system whose strength is greater than any conceivable stress put on the system. In reality, weight, volume, and cost constraints usually limit the strength of the design. Although perfect reliability from space systems cannot be expected, consideration of the needs of the operational community as well as the budget of the program will help in determining a requirement level. Also, if reliability goals are not met, it may be necessary to initiate a reliability growth scenario in which failure modes are analyzed and designed out of the system. This may or may not cost the program extra money, as reliability growth testing may not have been part of the original life cycle plan.As mentioned above, the International Space Station Program has levied a quantitative performance requirement on the Prime Contractor. Arrival at that requirement came through rigorous coordination with operational elements of the program, including the Mission Operations Directorate and the Science and Utilization community. The actual benchmark of 0.8 was derived from analysis of the operational needs of the program, the number of failures that could be tolerated, and an early analysis of what the space station design concept could provide. This number was a mutual agreement between the product assurance community and the operations community. As a result of this requirement, the prime is undergoing an effort as part of it\u00eds reliability group to maintain a running tally of the overall station reliability via reliability block diagram analysis. Every design change, program change, or other input is reflected in the running tally to ensure that the design meets the requirement.Technical Rationale:Many previous NASA program development efforts have relied on specific design requirements such as redundancy to minimize risk and the likelihood of failure. Quantitative reliability requirements augment qualitative reliability analysis such as failure tolerance, but more importantly, gives teeth to a requirement that may otherwise slip from the design. Designers and contractors are held responsible for designing systems and to demonstrate analytically that the system or function will have a sufficient likelihood of failure-free mission operations.References:SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS),\" November 1, 1994, Contract NAS15-10000.NASA Risk Management Program Tools and Techniques Handbook, Draft, July 1988, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.NASA Safety Risk Management Program Plan, Sections 1-5, NASA Headquarters, Code QS.Reliability Preferred Practice PD-AP-1313, \"System Reliability Assessment Using Block Diagramming Methods.\"",

Early in the design process, the system developer will be required to consider how the design will provide the requisite reliability characteristics and must provide analyses to verify that the delivered hardware will meet the requirements. Assessment of the early design's ability to meet quantitative reliability requirements will support design trades, component selection, and maintainability design, and help assure that appropriate material strengths are used as well as the appropriate levels and types of redundancy.Implementation Method:The missions and scientific objectives of the subject space system are used to define quantitative reliability goals and objectives. In general, the quantitative reliability goals and objectives are stated as requisite probabilities of achieving specific missions or scientific objectives under stated operating conditions and environments. The probability values specified as being required are established through a process of trading off a desire for very high value against the cost and design constraints of achieving that value. The specified level will also determine an accepted level of risk or likelihood that the mission objective will not be met. Very often, the acceptable level may be negotiated between the science community or user, the contractor, and the various responsible NASA organizations.The use of quantitative performance-based reliability requirements does not supersede or negate the need for specifying fault tolerance or other classical reliability requirements. Fault tolerance requirements and reliability design criteria should also be levied to ensure the proper separation of redundancy, and the avoidance of failure propagation. Quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that the operational performance and missions can be met with an accepted probability level or likelihood. Table 1 shows examples of several different types of quantitative reliability requirements that can be levied on a space hardware program. The importance of using both types of requirements lies in the need to ensure that the system design is as robust as necessary and that it meets the verifiable performance goal. These types of requirements, if utilized correctly, will work hand in hand to provide the contractor direction on developing a more reliable product. The quantitative requirements are levied to ensure that operational needs can be met based on pre-set conditions.[D]Table 1: Examples of Quantitative Reliability RequirementsA quantitative reliability requirement by definition means that the reliability is expressed in a measurable quantity. Performance-based reliability requirements are generally stated in terms of the probability of properly performing a mission phase or objective without a failure (or sequence of failures) that will terminate the mission phase. An example is the International Space Station reliability requirement in SSP 41000, \"System Specification for the International Space Station (ISS).\" The reliability requirement in SSP 41000 states that the Space Station shall provide an operational capability to provide a microgravity environment for 50 percent of the internal payload locations for at least 180 days per year in continuous periods of no less than 30 days with a reliability of 0.80 or better. This requirement holds the ISS prime contractor responsible for providing a vehicle design that will operate continuously for 30 days without suffering a system failure that would exceed the conditions necessary for microgravity science, and do so at least 4 out of 5 of the periods. The system reliability, given its associated components and redundancy configuration, can be measured against that quantitative requirement. Also, during design reviews, consideration must be given to reliability assessments of the design because of such requirements, thus heightening the awareness of program risks that may otherwise go uncovered.Other requirement statements might relate to the launch phase of a space system or simply to the normal operation phase. However, the specific elements of the requirement statement include the description of the desired performance, usually a direct or indirect reference to the amount of time involved, and the probability value needed. The mission/objective specified in a reliability requirement may deal with a major portion of the entire mission or may be a very specific portion of the mission. For instance, a reliability requirement may be specified for the ability to maintain attitude or perform a significant mission event.The specification values used for the reliability requirement depends on the criticality of the mission or objective and the consequences of failure. In the Space Station case, loss of the microgravity capability is not inherently catastrophic, and a repair capability is available. Four successful 30-day periods out of five was considered to be reasonably achievable, and was deemed to be acceptable to the scientific user community. In man-rated vehicles, determining an acceptable value for the likelihood of mission success (hence loss of mission) may be more difficult. However, specifications for the reliability may then address the probability of avoiding mission aborts or loss of function. An example might be \"the item shall perform its functions during the launch phase without losing any of the defined capabilities or functions with a probability of 0.98.\" The Federal Aviation Administration relates the consequence of failure and the probability of its occurrence in its consideration of risk, and is shown in Figure 1. By defining quantitative reliability requirements as those involving failure events throughout a flight leading to emergency procedures or immediate landings (mission aborts), the quantitative values for commercial vehicles would be specified in the 0.999 to 0.99999 range, (or conversely 1 out of a thousand to 1 out of 100 thousand).[D]Figure 1: An Illustration of the Relationship Between Consequence of Failure and the Probability of Its Occurrence (FAA, Updated)In non-man rated vehicles or systems, the emphasis is on specifying a requirement that is sufficient to ensure a high likelihood of mission success, but not so high as to drive cost and weight beyond reasonable bounds. The use of function and item redundancy for increasing the likelihood of mission success will likely be necessary to meet high quantitative reliability specifications, but redundancy can also add significant program costs. Again, trade studies may be necessary to balance requirements for the likelihood of meeting a mission objective against the reliability achieved with current manufacturing technologies and against various design options. For instance, it would be extremely difficult at current technology levels to meet a 0.999 reliability on a lengthy mission of high complexity without the use of functional redundancy. For quick-development, highly cost-restrictive programs with limited objectives, a performance-based reliability requirement of 0.9 or less may be appropriate to keep the acquisition costs within bounds.To verify the fulfillment of a quantitative requirement, reliability analysis such as reliability block diagram analysis (RBDA) is used. The attribute of reliability, by definition, lies in the probabilistic realm while most performance attributes or parameters such as temperature, speed, thrust, voltage, or material strength contain more deterministic characteristics. Within the accuracy of the measuring devices, one can directly measure performance attributes in the deterministic realm to verify compliance with requirements. No such measuring device exists for probabilistic parameters like reliability; it is usually estimated through comparison to similar components or systems through inference, analysis, and the use of statistics. Verification that quantitative requirements have been met also provides answers to questions such as \"how reliable is this system?\"[D]Table 2: Quantitative Reliability Requirement Verification TechniquesA reliability requirement specified without a probability value such as \"the vehicle shall perform xyz mission on-orbit without failure for 5 years\" is impossible to verify during qualification or acceptance testing. The likelihood, or probability, that the requirement will be met is assessable, and this activity is inherently equivalent to assessing the reliability. Without quantitative requirements, it is left to the certification assessor to evaluate an estimate of the probability of success and to decide if that is sufficient, which places the risk on the program.A great deal of preliminary analysis may be necessary in the requirement specification process that considers the capability of the technology to various levels of reliability. This preliminary analysis helps avoid setting quantitative requirements too high or too low. Development of quantitative reliability requirements must represent a balance between the operational performance requirements of the system and the ability to restore and maintain the system through maintenance and sparing.Establishment of quantitative requirements as high as possible is necessary to maximize the probability that the system will complete the mission without failure. However, achieving high reliability or probability of mission success increases cost by generally requiring redundant equipment and fail-safe devices as well as high margins of safety in the material properties used.

Successful design and manufacturing of ablative composite materials for solid motor nozzles provides for proper transfer of the combustion gases from the burning propellant surface through the nozzle without damage to the metal structure. Use of a properly controlled manufacturing process will result in the proper density, percent resin content, compressive strength, interlaminar shear strength, thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and tensile strength.Implementation:The increased interest in carbon-phenolic composite materials at NASA is due to the use of these materials as the ablative materials in the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) nozzle of the Space Shuttle and potential follow-on solid rocket motor upgrades. The practices discussed here are the current industry standards, and, however successful, much work is yet to be done. Most of the manufacturing practices have evolved by the trial and error method and could benefit greatly from further scientific investigation. Almost all of the nozzle materials and processes need continued research and development efforts as NASA strives for optimal performance from advanced materials. In the design of ablative nozzle components, considerable attention should be given to thermo-structural, thermochemical, process modeling and other computer predictive and analysis codes. Various computer based analytical and simulation programs are available and have been used successfully in characterizing ablative materials and their erosion, char, and thermal protection characteristics. Typical programs that have been used for this purpose are: Charring Material Ablator (CMA), Aerothermal Chemical Equilibrium (ACE), Momentum and Energy Integral Techniques (MEIT) (ACE and MEIT are used in conjunction with the CMA program), and PATRAN (geometry of nozzle, a general model for structural and thermal analysis). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a discipline that is finding increasing usage in evaluating the exhaust flow in SRM nozzles and in determining potential heat transfer to nozzle components. These techniques are important tools for the designer who is applying ablative composites to solid rocket motor nozzles.[D]As shown on Figures 1 and 2, the aluminum structure of the SRM nozzle is protected from the heat of the expanding gasses by a series of carbon cloth phenolic rings backed up by glass or silica cloth phenolic rings. The glass and silica cloth phenolic backup rings are provided for structural, insulation, and galvanic corrosion protection. In lieu of one single ring, a series of rings is used for ease of manufacture and handling. Factors of safety for ablative carbon cloth phenolic vary between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 for erosion and are usually about 1.25 for char, depending upon the location of the ablative carbon cloth phenolic in the nozzle. Generally, the factors of safety in the entrance section of the nozzle are higher than in the exit section.The optimum angle between the plies and the flame surface in SRM nozzles using ablative carbon cloth phenolic has been proven to be between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, depending upon the location, contour and heating conditions at various sections of the nozzle.[D]Manufacture of Carbon Cloth:The carbon cloth used to fabricate composite solid rocket motor nozzles is impregnated with the binder or matrix prior to wrap and cure. This preimpregnated material is commonly called \"prepreg\" in the composite industry. The diversity of the manufacturing process requires six different vendors before final material is produced. These vendors: 1) produce rayon thread; 2) weave cloth; 3) carbonize cloth; 4) produce resin; 5) produce carbon fillers; and 6) impregnate carbon cloth with resin and filler (production of prepreg). Constant monitoring of all phases of the manufacturing process is required to ensure satisfactory quality. The rayon thread is manufactured, then woven into cloth 60 in. wide. The rayon cloth is carbonized by slowly heating to 1000 deg. to 1500 deg. C in an inert atmosphere. Critical factors to be controlled in this process are the rate of temperature increase, time, and maintenance of an inert atmosphere in the oven.After carbonization, the carbon-cloth is impregnated by drawing it through a heated container of phenolic resin and carbon filler to form prepreg. Critical factors that must be carefully controlled in the preimpregnation process are temperature of the resin/filler mixture, tension and speed of the cloth through the resin/filler mixture, pressure on the roller to ensure penetration of resin into the cloth, oven temperature after impregnation to remove volatiles, and control staging of the resin. The prepreg should meet the uncured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 1 and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 2. However, it should be pointed out that since the structural minimum - maximum properties shown on Table 2 vary by factors greater than 2 indicate that additional material, process and cure controls improvements are required to narrow the variation in material capabilities.Table 1.

Potential shelf life may be extended if the material meets the retest properties of Table 1. The prepreg tape rolls should be cut on a 45 deg. bias in widths of 3 in. and 12 in. The bias cut allows the cloth to stretch and conform to the different mandrels, and the narrow widths help avoid wrinkling and folding of the material during the wrapping process. The rolled prepreg is bagged with desiccant and stored in an environmentally controlled cold storage until it is required for processing.Glass Cloth Phenolic:The glass cloth phenolic shown in Figure 2 is used to provide structural integrity, a corrosion barrier, and insulation. It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 5.Table 2.

It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 6. The silica cloth phenolic is a higher purity material than the glass cloth phenolic, and is only used in the cowl ring.Nozzle Ablative Composites Fabrication:The fabrication process for the components of the nozzle includes two tape wrappings and two machining operations. Because of the sensitive variables occurring during tape wrapping of the prepreg tape, a highly skilled operator is required who understands what is required when one of the variables changes. The critical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, and tape tension. There are many other random variables that play a less significant role. The material is wrapped onto a mandrel which has been machined to the desired contour of the component as specified in the manufacturing plan. Depending upon the component location, the first wrap could be either bias-cut carbon cloth phenolic, glass cloth phenolic, or silica cloth phenolic tape wrapped on the mandrel at a specified angle (which depends upon the nozzle component) to the centerline of the nozzle. Enough tape should be wrapped to provide machining stock and tag ends after cure.The tape wrapping process places the tape at the proper angle and debulks the tape material to minimize movement of the tape during cure. Debulking of the tape should be achieved by applying heat and pressure at the point of contact with the mandrel or the previous ply. Heat should be applied prior to wrapping to make the tape tacky. The pressure roller forces the fibers to nest and compact (debulk) within the resin/fabric matrix. CO2 is used to cool the resin to stop further cure, and dimensionally and thermally stabilizes the billet for further processing. All ablative components are cured in a hydroclave except the aft exit cone, outer boot ring, and the cowl, which are cured in an autoclave.After wrapping, the billet and mandrel are vacuum bagged for waterproofing, then installed in a hydroclave for final cure. Curing of the carbon-cloth liner requires a pressure of 1000 psi at 310 deg. F for a minimum of five hours. After the cure cycle, a test ring should be removed and tested to verify the properties of the cured carbon cloth phenolic. The carbon cloth is then machined to configuration.In preparation for the second wrap, a coat of phenolic resin is applied to the machined surface of the first layer of phenolic. The second layer of phenolic tape is wrapped at the desired angle to the nozzle centerline using the same process as described for the carbon-cloth phenolic. The component is vacuum bagged and cured in an autoclave at 250 psi at a temperature of 310 deg. F for approximately four hours. Carbon and glass rings should be removed and tested to verify properties of the cure. The billet is final machined, removed from the mandrel and x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations and low density indications. Following x-ray, the machined component is ready for bonding to the metal housings. Bonding of the machined ablative component to the metal housing is accomplished in a clean environment and requires strict process control.Inspection, Destructive, And Non-Destructive Evaluation:A very important development in nondestructive testing that promises to help maintain the meticulous cleanliness required to ensure bonding of composites to adjacent metallic structures is computer controlled scanning of the metal surface with devices based on Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) principle. Computer controlled contamination scanning (CONSCAN) is a system developed by MSFC using the OSEE technique for automated scanning of metal surfaces prior to critical bonding operations. The CONSCAN system provides the sensitivity and spacial resolution necessary when scanning large areas to ensure that surfaces are sufficiently free of contaminants that reduce bond strength. Scanning the surface with CONSCAN provides a map of surface contamination levels, which clearly identifies those areas that require further cleaning. Rescanning after the additional cleaning operation provides results of that recleaning. These data provide a permanent record of surface cleanliness levels. The data records may be used at a later date to help identify the specific process during which contamination occurred and to correlate surface cleanliness levels with subsequent debond locations.The carbon cloth prepreg, glass cloth prepreg, and silica cloth prepreg should be visually inspected to ensure that there are no broken fibers, voids, or lack of resin or filler. Coupons of these materials should also be tested to verify uncured and cured properties. After final machining of both glass cloth and carbon cloth wraps, the materials should be x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations, and low density areas. Defects of this type may be cause for rejection and scrappage. An alcohol wipe may be performed on the finished surface. Collection of alcohol in a spot or line before drying, will indicate a crevice or void in the surface. The x-ray technician should be highly skilled in taking and reading the x-rays to avoid scrapping an expensive component due to erroneous low density indications. Low density indications could be caused by fiber ends not being flush with next butt end and the gap being filled with resin and filler, density variations, and interlaminar resin-rich areas.The tag ends and rings removed after curing should be used to verify mechanical properties. Tag ends and rings could also be used for plasma torch testing to verify the erosion rate and the factor of safety.Technical Rationale:Precision design and manufacturing procedures for ablative material for solid rocket motor nozzles have been developed over a period of 30 years. The design of the ablative material depends upon factors such as the solid propellant composition; combustion gas temperature, velocity and composition; and relative position of the material in the nozzle. Problems that have surfaced over the years were analyzed, improvements proposed; and, when approved through the NASA change board process, were designed, prototyped, ground tested and flown. Information for this practice was derived from a number of sources, including procurement specifications and manufacturing plans for the SRM and RSRM experimental studies, problem reporting and corrective action (PRACA) reports at MSFC, AIAA reports, and from personal interviews and telephone interviews with individuals from MSFC organizations and contractor organizations.References:Hall, William B.: \"Standardization of the Carbon-Phenolic Materials and Processes, Volume I, Experimental Studies,\" Professor of Chemical Engineering, Mississippi State University, August 31, 1988.Kelly, P. and Thompson, A.: \"AIAA 89-2661 Low Density Indications in Radiographs of Solid Rocket Motor Ablatives,\" 25th Joint Propulsion Conference, Morton Thiokol Inc., July 10-12, 1989.TWR-10341 (CD) Rev.

Factors of safety for ablative carbon cloth phenolic vary between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 for erosion and are usually about 1.25 for char, depending upon the location of the ablative carbon cloth phenolic in the nozzle. Generally, the factors of safety in the entrance section of the nozzle are higher than in the exit section.The optimum angle between the plies and the flame surface in SRM nozzles using ablative carbon cloth phenolic has been proven to be between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, depending upon the location, contour and heating conditions at various sections of the nozzle.[D]Manufacture of Carbon Cloth:The carbon cloth used to fabricate composite solid rocket motor nozzles is impregnated with the binder or matrix prior to wrap and cure. This preimpregnated material is commonly called \"prepreg\" in the composite industry. The diversity of the manufacturing process requires six different vendors before final material is produced. These vendors: 1) produce rayon thread; 2) weave cloth; 3) carbonize cloth; 4) produce resin; 5) produce carbon fillers; and 6) impregnate carbon cloth with resin and filler (production of prepreg). Constant monitoring of all phases of the manufacturing process is required to ensure satisfactory quality. The rayon thread is manufactured, then woven into cloth 60 in. wide. The rayon cloth is carbonized by slowly heating to 1000 deg. to 1500 deg. C in an inert atmosphere. Critical factors to be controlled in this process are the rate of temperature increase, time, and maintenance of an inert atmosphere in the oven.After carbonization, the carbon-cloth is impregnated by drawing it through a heated container of phenolic resin and carbon filler to form prepreg. Critical factors that must be carefully controlled in the preimpregnation process are temperature of the resin/filler mixture, tension and speed of the cloth through the resin/filler mixture, pressure on the roller to ensure penetration of resin into the cloth, oven temperature after impregnation to remove volatiles, and control staging of the resin. The prepreg should meet the uncured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 1 and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 2. However, it should be pointed out that since the structural minimum - maximum properties shown on Table 2 vary by factors greater than 2 indicate that additional material, process and cure controls improvements are required to narrow the variation in material capabilities.Table 1.

Potential shelf life may be extended if the material meets the retest properties of Table 1. The prepreg tape rolls should be cut on a 45 deg. bias in widths of 3 in. and 12 in. The bias cut allows the cloth to stretch and conform to the different mandrels, and the narrow widths help avoid wrinkling and folding of the material during the wrapping process. The rolled prepreg is bagged with desiccant and stored in an environmentally controlled cold storage until it is required for processing.Glass Cloth Phenolic:The glass cloth phenolic shown in Figure 2 is used to provide structural integrity, a corrosion barrier, and insulation. It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 5.Table 2.

It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 6. The silica cloth phenolic is a higher purity material than the glass cloth phenolic, and is only used in the cowl ring.Nozzle Ablative Composites Fabrication:The fabrication process for the components of the nozzle includes two tape wrappings and two machining operations. Because of the sensitive variables occurring during tape wrapping of the prepreg tape, a highly skilled operator is required who understands what is required when one of the variables changes. The critical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, and tape tension. There are many other random variables that play a less significant role. The material is wrapped onto a mandrel which has been machined to the desired contour of the component as specified in the manufacturing plan. Depending upon the component location, the first wrap could be either bias-cut carbon cloth phenolic, glass cloth phenolic, or silica cloth phenolic tape wrapped on the mandrel at a specified angle (which depends upon the nozzle component) to the centerline of the nozzle. Enough tape should be wrapped to provide machining stock and tag ends after cure.The tape wrapping process places the tape at the proper angle and debulks the tape material to minimize movement of the tape during cure. Debulking of the tape should be achieved by applying heat and pressure at the point of contact with the mandrel or the previous ply. Heat should be applied prior to wrapping to make the tape tacky. The pressure roller forces the fibers to nest and compact (debulk) within the resin/fabric matrix. CO2 is used to cool the resin to stop further cure, and dimensionally and thermally stabilizes the billet for further processing. All ablative components are cured in a hydroclave except the aft exit cone, outer boot ring, and the cowl, which are cured in an autoclave.After wrapping, the billet and mandrel are vacuum bagged for waterproofing, then installed in a hydroclave for final cure. Curing of the carbon-cloth liner requires a pressure of 1000 psi at 310 deg. F for a minimum of five hours. After the cure cycle, a test ring should be removed and tested to verify the properties of the cured carbon cloth phenolic. The carbon cloth is then machined to configuration.In preparation for the second wrap, a coat of phenolic resin is applied to the machined surface of the first layer of phenolic. The second layer of phenolic tape is wrapped at the desired angle to the nozzle centerline using the same process as described for the carbon-cloth phenolic. The component is vacuum bagged and cured in an autoclave at 250 psi at a temperature of 310 deg. F for approximately four hours. Carbon and glass rings should be removed and tested to verify properties of the cure. The billet is final machined, removed from the mandrel and x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations and low density indications. Following x-ray, the machined component is ready for bonding to the metal housings. Bonding of the machined ablative component to the metal housing is accomplished in a clean environment and requires strict process control.Inspection, Destructive, And Non-Destructive Evaluation:A very important development in nondestructive testing that promises to help maintain the meticulous cleanliness required to ensure bonding of composites to adjacent metallic structures is computer controlled scanning of the metal surface with devices based on Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) principle. Computer controlled contamination scanning (CONSCAN) is a system developed by MSFC using the OSEE technique for automated scanning of metal surfaces prior to critical bonding operations. The CONSCAN system provides the sensitivity and spacial resolution necessary when scanning large areas to ensure that surfaces are sufficiently free of contaminants that reduce bond strength. Scanning the surface with CONSCAN provides a map of surface contamination levels, which clearly identifies those areas that require further cleaning. Rescanning after the additional cleaning operation provides results of that recleaning. These data provide a permanent record of surface cleanliness levels. The data records may be used at a later date to help identify the specific process during which contamination occurred and to correlate surface cleanliness levels with subsequent debond locations.The carbon cloth prepreg, glass cloth prepreg, and silica cloth prepreg should be visually inspected to ensure that there are no broken fibers, voids, or lack of resin or filler. Coupons of these materials should also be tested to verify uncured and cured properties. After final machining of both glass cloth and carbon cloth wraps, the materials should be x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations, and low density areas. Defects of this type may be cause for rejection and scrappage. An alcohol wipe may be performed on the finished surface. Collection of alcohol in a spot or line before drying, will indicate a crevice or void in the surface. The x-ray technician should be highly skilled in taking and reading the x-rays to avoid scrapping an expensive component due to erroneous low density indications. Low density indications could be caused by fiber ends not being flush with next butt end and the gap being filled with resin and filler, density variations, and interlaminar resin-rich areas.The tag ends and rings removed after curing should be used to verify mechanical properties. Tag ends and rings could also be used for plasma torch testing to verify the erosion rate and the factor of safety.Technical Rationale:Precision design and manufacturing procedures for ablative material for solid rocket motor nozzles have been developed over a period of 30 years. The design of the ablative material depends upon factors such as the solid propellant composition; combustion gas temperature, velocity and composition; and relative position of the material in the nozzle. Problems that have surfaced over the years were analyzed, improvements proposed; and, when approved through the NASA change board process, were designed, prototyped, ground tested and flown. Information for this practice was derived from a number of sources, including procurement specifications and manufacturing plans for the SRM and RSRM experimental studies, problem reporting and corrective action (PRACA) reports at MSFC, AIAA reports, and from personal interviews and telephone interviews with individuals from MSFC organizations and contractor organizations.References:Hall, William B.: \"Standardization of the Carbon-Phenolic Materials and Processes, Volume I, Experimental Studies,\" Professor of Chemical Engineering, Mississippi State University, August 31, 1988.Kelly, P. and Thompson, A.: \"AIAA 89-2661 Low Density Indications in Radiographs of Solid Rocket Motor Ablatives,\" 25th Joint Propulsion Conference, Morton Thiokol Inc., July 10-12, 1989.TWR-10341 (CD) Rev.

Most of the manufacturing practices have evolved by the trial and error method and could benefit greatly from further scientific investigation. Almost all of the nozzle materials and processes need continued research and development efforts as NASA strives for optimal performance from advanced materials. In the design of ablative nozzle components, considerable attention should be given to thermo-structural, thermochemical, process modeling and other computer predictive and analysis codes. Various computer based analytical and simulation programs are available and have been used successfully in characterizing ablative materials and their erosion, char, and thermal protection characteristics.

These techniques are important tools for the designer who is applying ablative composites to solid rocket motor nozzles.[D]As shown on Figures 1 and 2, the aluminum structure of the SRM nozzle is protected from the heat of the expanding gasses by a series of carbon cloth phenolic rings backed up by glass or silica cloth phenolic rings. The glass and silica cloth phenolic backup rings are provided for structural, insulation, and galvanic corrosion protection. In lieu of one single ring, a series of rings is used for ease of manufacture and handling. Factors of safety for ablative carbon cloth phenolic vary between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 for erosion and are usually about 1.25 for char, depending upon the location of the ablative carbon cloth phenolic in the nozzle. Generally, the factors of safety in the entrance section of the nozzle are higher than in the exit section.The optimum angle between the plies and the flame surface in SRM nozzles using ablative carbon cloth phenolic has been proven to be between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, depending upon the location, contour and heating conditions at various sections of the nozzle.[D]Manufacture of Carbon Cloth:The carbon cloth used to fabricate composite solid rocket motor nozzles is impregnated with the binder or matrix prior to wrap and cure. This preimpregnated material is commonly called \"prepreg\" in the composite industry. The diversity of the manufacturing process requires six different vendors before final material is produced. These vendors: 1) produce rayon thread; 2) weave cloth; 3) carbonize cloth; 4) produce resin; 5) produce carbon fillers; and 6) impregnate carbon cloth with resin and filler (production of prepreg). Constant monitoring of all phases of the manufacturing process is required to ensure satisfactory quality. The rayon thread is manufactured, then woven into cloth 60 in. wide. The rayon cloth is carbonized by slowly heating to 1000 deg. to 1500 deg. C in an inert atmosphere. Critical factors to be controlled in this process are the rate of temperature increase, time, and maintenance of an inert atmosphere in the oven.After carbonization, the carbon-cloth is impregnated by drawing it through a heated container of phenolic resin and carbon filler to form prepreg. Critical factors that must be carefully controlled in the preimpregnation process are temperature of the resin/filler mixture, tension and speed of the cloth through the resin/filler mixture, pressure on the roller to ensure penetration of resin into the cloth, oven temperature after impregnation to remove volatiles, and control staging of the resin. The prepreg should meet the uncured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 1 and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 2. However, it should be pointed out that since the structural minimum - maximum properties shown on Table 2 vary by factors greater than 2 indicate that additional material, process and cure controls improvements are required to narrow the variation in material capabilities.Table 1.

Potential shelf life may be extended if the material meets the retest properties of Table 1. The prepreg tape rolls should be cut on a 45 deg. bias in widths of 3 in. and 12 in. The bias cut allows the cloth to stretch and conform to the different mandrels, and the narrow widths help avoid wrinkling and folding of the material during the wrapping process. The rolled prepreg is bagged with desiccant and stored in an environmentally controlled cold storage until it is required for processing.Glass Cloth Phenolic:The glass cloth phenolic shown in Figure 2 is used to provide structural integrity, a corrosion barrier, and insulation. It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 5.Table 2.

It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 6. The silica cloth phenolic is a higher purity material than the glass cloth phenolic, and is only used in the cowl ring.Nozzle Ablative Composites Fabrication:The fabrication process for the components of the nozzle includes two tape wrappings and two machining operations. Because of the sensitive variables occurring during tape wrapping of the prepreg tape, a highly skilled operator is required who understands what is required when one of the variables changes. The critical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, and tape tension. There are many other random variables that play a less significant role. The material is wrapped onto a mandrel which has been machined to the desired contour of the component as specified in the manufacturing plan. Depending upon the component location, the first wrap could be either bias-cut carbon cloth phenolic, glass cloth phenolic, or silica cloth phenolic tape wrapped on the mandrel at a specified angle (which depends upon the nozzle component) to the centerline of the nozzle. Enough tape should be wrapped to provide machining stock and tag ends after cure.The tape wrapping process places the tape at the proper angle and debulks the tape material to minimize movement of the tape during cure. Debulking of the tape should be achieved by applying heat and pressure at the point of contact with the mandrel or the previous ply. Heat should be applied prior to wrapping to make the tape tacky. The pressure roller forces the fibers to nest and compact (debulk) within the resin/fabric matrix. CO2 is used to cool the resin to stop further cure, and dimensionally and thermally stabilizes the billet for further processing. All ablative components are cured in a hydroclave except the aft exit cone, outer boot ring, and the cowl, which are cured in an autoclave.After wrapping, the billet and mandrel are vacuum bagged for waterproofing, then installed in a hydroclave for final cure. Curing of the carbon-cloth liner requires a pressure of 1000 psi at 310 deg. F for a minimum of five hours. After the cure cycle, a test ring should be removed and tested to verify the properties of the cured carbon cloth phenolic. The carbon cloth is then machined to configuration.In preparation for the second wrap, a coat of phenolic resin is applied to the machined surface of the first layer of phenolic. The second layer of phenolic tape is wrapped at the desired angle to the nozzle centerline using the same process as described for the carbon-cloth phenolic. The component is vacuum bagged and cured in an autoclave at 250 psi at a temperature of 310 deg. F for approximately four hours. Carbon and glass rings should be removed and tested to verify properties of the cure. The billet is final machined, removed from the mandrel and x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations and low density indications. Following x-ray, the machined component is ready for bonding to the metal housings. Bonding of the machined ablative component to the metal housing is accomplished in a clean environment and requires strict process control.Inspection, Destructive, And Non-Destructive Evaluation:A very important development in nondestructive testing that promises to help maintain the meticulous cleanliness required to ensure bonding of composites to adjacent metallic structures is computer controlled scanning of the metal surface with devices based on Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) principle. Computer controlled contamination scanning (CONSCAN) is a system developed by MSFC using the OSEE technique for automated scanning of metal surfaces prior to critical bonding operations. The CONSCAN system provides the sensitivity and spacial resolution necessary when scanning large areas to ensure that surfaces are sufficiently free of contaminants that reduce bond strength. Scanning the surface with CONSCAN provides a map of surface contamination levels, which clearly identifies those areas that require further cleaning. Rescanning after the additional cleaning operation provides results of that recleaning. These data provide a permanent record of surface cleanliness levels. The data records may be used at a later date to help identify the specific process during which contamination occurred and to correlate surface cleanliness levels with subsequent debond locations.The carbon cloth prepreg, glass cloth prepreg, and silica cloth prepreg should be visually inspected to ensure that there are no broken fibers, voids, or lack of resin or filler. Coupons of these materials should also be tested to verify uncured and cured properties. After final machining of both glass cloth and carbon cloth wraps, the materials should be x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations, and low density areas. Defects of this type may be cause for rejection and scrappage. An alcohol wipe may be performed on the finished surface. Collection of alcohol in a spot or line before drying, will indicate a crevice or void in the surface. The x-ray technician should be highly skilled in taking and reading the x-rays to avoid scrapping an expensive component due to erroneous low density indications. Low density indications could be caused by fiber ends not being flush with next butt end and the gap being filled with resin and filler, density variations, and interlaminar resin-rich areas.The tag ends and rings removed after curing should be used to verify mechanical properties. Tag ends and rings could also be used for plasma torch testing to verify the erosion rate and the factor of safety.Technical Rationale:Precision design and manufacturing procedures for ablative material for solid rocket motor nozzles have been developed over a period of 30 years. The design of the ablative material depends upon factors such as the solid propellant composition; combustion gas temperature, velocity and composition; and relative position of the material in the nozzle. Problems that have surfaced over the years were analyzed, improvements proposed; and, when approved through the NASA change board process, were designed, prototyped, ground tested and flown. Information for this practice was derived from a number of sources, including procurement specifications and manufacturing plans for the SRM and RSRM experimental studies, problem reporting and corrective action (PRACA) reports at MSFC, AIAA reports, and from personal interviews and telephone interviews with individuals from MSFC organizations and contractor organizations.References:Hall, William B.: \"Standardization of the Carbon-Phenolic Materials and Processes, Volume I, Experimental Studies,\" Professor of Chemical Engineering, Mississippi State University, August 31, 1988.Kelly, P. and Thompson, A.: \"AIAA 89-2661 Low Density Indications in Radiographs of Solid Rocket Motor Ablatives,\" 25th Joint Propulsion Conference, Morton Thiokol Inc., July 10-12, 1989.TWR-10341 (CD) Rev.

In the design of ablative nozzle components, considerable attention should be given to thermo-structural, thermochemical, process modeling and other computer predictive and analysis codes. Various computer based analytical and simulation programs are available and have been used successfully in characterizing ablative materials and their erosion, char, and thermal protection characteristics. Typical programs that have been used for this purpose are: Charring Material Ablator (CMA), Aerothermal Chemical Equilibrium (ACE), Momentum and Energy Integral Techniques (MEIT) (ACE and MEIT are used in conjunction with the CMA program), and PATRAN (geometry of nozzle, a general model for structural and thermal analysis). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a discipline that is finding increasing usage in evaluating the exhaust flow in SRM nozzles and in determining potential heat transfer to nozzle components. These techniques are important tools for the designer who is applying ablative composites to solid rocket motor nozzles.[D]As shown on Figures 1 and 2, the aluminum structure of the SRM nozzle is protected from the heat of the expanding gasses by a series of carbon cloth phenolic rings backed up by glass or silica cloth phenolic rings. The glass and silica cloth phenolic backup rings are provided for structural, insulation, and galvanic corrosion protection. In lieu of one single ring, a series of rings is used for ease of manufacture and handling. Factors of safety for ablative carbon cloth phenolic vary between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 for erosion and are usually about 1.25 for char, depending upon the location of the ablative carbon cloth phenolic in the nozzle. Generally, the factors of safety in the entrance section of the nozzle are higher than in the exit section.The optimum angle between the plies and the flame surface in SRM nozzles using ablative carbon cloth phenolic has been proven to be between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, depending upon the location, contour and heating conditions at various sections of the nozzle.[D]Manufacture of Carbon Cloth:The carbon cloth used to fabricate composite solid rocket motor nozzles is impregnated with the binder or matrix prior to wrap and cure. This preimpregnated material is commonly called \"prepreg\" in the composite industry. The diversity of the manufacturing process requires six different vendors before final material is produced. These vendors: 1) produce rayon thread; 2) weave cloth; 3) carbonize cloth; 4) produce resin; 5) produce carbon fillers; and 6) impregnate carbon cloth with resin and filler (production of prepreg). Constant monitoring of all phases of the manufacturing process is required to ensure satisfactory quality. The rayon thread is manufactured, then woven into cloth 60 in. wide. The rayon cloth is carbonized by slowly heating to 1000 deg. to 1500 deg. C in an inert atmosphere. Critical factors to be controlled in this process are the rate of temperature increase, time, and maintenance of an inert atmosphere in the oven.After carbonization, the carbon-cloth is impregnated by drawing it through a heated container of phenolic resin and carbon filler to form prepreg. Critical factors that must be carefully controlled in the preimpregnation process are temperature of the resin/filler mixture, tension and speed of the cloth through the resin/filler mixture, pressure on the roller to ensure penetration of resin into the cloth, oven temperature after impregnation to remove volatiles, and control staging of the resin. The prepreg should meet the uncured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 1 and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 2. However, it should be pointed out that since the structural minimum - maximum properties shown on Table 2 vary by factors greater than 2 indicate that additional material, process and cure controls improvements are required to narrow the variation in material capabilities.Table 1.

Potential shelf life may be extended if the material meets the retest properties of Table 1. The prepreg tape rolls should be cut on a 45 deg. bias in widths of 3 in. and 12 in. The bias cut allows the cloth to stretch and conform to the different mandrels, and the narrow widths help avoid wrinkling and folding of the material during the wrapping process. The rolled prepreg is bagged with desiccant and stored in an environmentally controlled cold storage until it is required for processing.Glass Cloth Phenolic:The glass cloth phenolic shown in Figure 2 is used to provide structural integrity, a corrosion barrier, and insulation. It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 5.Table 2.

It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 6. The silica cloth phenolic is a higher purity material than the glass cloth phenolic, and is only used in the cowl ring.Nozzle Ablative Composites Fabrication:The fabrication process for the components of the nozzle includes two tape wrappings and two machining operations. Because of the sensitive variables occurring during tape wrapping of the prepreg tape, a highly skilled operator is required who understands what is required when one of the variables changes. The critical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, and tape tension. There are many other random variables that play a less significant role. The material is wrapped onto a mandrel which has been machined to the desired contour of the component as specified in the manufacturing plan. Depending upon the component location, the first wrap could be either bias-cut carbon cloth phenolic, glass cloth phenolic, or silica cloth phenolic tape wrapped on the mandrel at a specified angle (which depends upon the nozzle component) to the centerline of the nozzle. Enough tape should be wrapped to provide machining stock and tag ends after cure.The tape wrapping process places the tape at the proper angle and debulks the tape material to minimize movement of the tape during cure. Debulking of the tape should be achieved by applying heat and pressure at the point of contact with the mandrel or the previous ply. Heat should be applied prior to wrapping to make the tape tacky. The pressure roller forces the fibers to nest and compact (debulk) within the resin/fabric matrix. CO2 is used to cool the resin to stop further cure, and dimensionally and thermally stabilizes the billet for further processing. All ablative components are cured in a hydroclave except the aft exit cone, outer boot ring, and the cowl, which are cured in an autoclave.After wrapping, the billet and mandrel are vacuum bagged for waterproofing, then installed in a hydroclave for final cure. Curing of the carbon-cloth liner requires a pressure of 1000 psi at 310 deg. F for a minimum of five hours. After the cure cycle, a test ring should be removed and tested to verify the properties of the cured carbon cloth phenolic. The carbon cloth is then machined to configuration.In preparation for the second wrap, a coat of phenolic resin is applied to the machined surface of the first layer of phenolic. The second layer of phenolic tape is wrapped at the desired angle to the nozzle centerline using the same process as described for the carbon-cloth phenolic. The component is vacuum bagged and cured in an autoclave at 250 psi at a temperature of 310 deg. F for approximately four hours. Carbon and glass rings should be removed and tested to verify properties of the cure. The billet is final machined, removed from the mandrel and x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations and low density indications. Following x-ray, the machined component is ready for bonding to the metal housings. Bonding of the machined ablative component to the metal housing is accomplished in a clean environment and requires strict process control.Inspection, Destructive, And Non-Destructive Evaluation:A very important development in nondestructive testing that promises to help maintain the meticulous cleanliness required to ensure bonding of composites to adjacent metallic structures is computer controlled scanning of the metal surface with devices based on Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) principle. Computer controlled contamination scanning (CONSCAN) is a system developed by MSFC using the OSEE technique for automated scanning of metal surfaces prior to critical bonding operations. The CONSCAN system provides the sensitivity and spacial resolution necessary when scanning large areas to ensure that surfaces are sufficiently free of contaminants that reduce bond strength. Scanning the surface with CONSCAN provides a map of surface contamination levels, which clearly identifies those areas that require further cleaning. Rescanning after the additional cleaning operation provides results of that recleaning. These data provide a permanent record of surface cleanliness levels. The data records may be used at a later date to help identify the specific process during which contamination occurred and to correlate surface cleanliness levels with subsequent debond locations.The carbon cloth prepreg, glass cloth prepreg, and silica cloth prepreg should be visually inspected to ensure that there are no broken fibers, voids, or lack of resin or filler. Coupons of these materials should also be tested to verify uncured and cured properties. After final machining of both glass cloth and carbon cloth wraps, the materials should be x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations, and low density areas. Defects of this type may be cause for rejection and scrappage. An alcohol wipe may be performed on the finished surface. Collection of alcohol in a spot or line before drying, will indicate a crevice or void in the surface. The x-ray technician should be highly skilled in taking and reading the x-rays to avoid scrapping an expensive component due to erroneous low density indications. Low density indications could be caused by fiber ends not being flush with next butt end and the gap being filled with resin and filler, density variations, and interlaminar resin-rich areas.The tag ends and rings removed after curing should be used to verify mechanical properties. Tag ends and rings could also be used for plasma torch testing to verify the erosion rate and the factor of safety.Technical Rationale:Precision design and manufacturing procedures for ablative material for solid rocket motor nozzles have been developed over a period of 30 years. The design of the ablative material depends upon factors such as the solid propellant composition; combustion gas temperature, velocity and composition; and relative position of the material in the nozzle. Problems that have surfaced over the years were analyzed, improvements proposed; and, when approved through the NASA change board process, were designed, prototyped, ground tested and flown. Information for this practice was derived from a number of sources, including procurement specifications and manufacturing plans for the SRM and RSRM experimental studies, problem reporting and corrective action (PRACA) reports at MSFC, AIAA reports, and from personal interviews and telephone interviews with individuals from MSFC organizations and contractor organizations.References:Hall, William B.: \"Standardization of the Carbon-Phenolic Materials and Processes, Volume I, Experimental Studies,\" Professor of Chemical Engineering, Mississippi State University, August 31, 1988.Kelly, P. and Thompson, A.: \"AIAA 89-2661 Low Density Indications in Radiographs of Solid Rocket Motor Ablatives,\" 25th Joint Propulsion Conference, Morton Thiokol Inc., July 10-12, 1989.TWR-10341 (CD) Rev.

Use of a properly controlled manufacturing process will result in the proper density, percent resin content, compressive strength, interlaminar shear strength, thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, and tensile strength.Implementation:The increased interest in carbon-phenolic composite materials at NASA is due to the use of these materials as the ablative materials in the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) nozzle of the Space Shuttle and potential follow-on solid rocket motor upgrades. The practices discussed here are the current industry standards, and, however successful, much work is yet to be done. Most of the manufacturing practices have evolved by the trial and error method and could benefit greatly from further scientific investigation. Almost all of the nozzle materials and processes need continued research and development efforts as NASA strives for optimal performance from advanced materials. In the design of ablative nozzle components, considerable attention should be given to thermo-structural, thermochemical, process modeling and other computer predictive and analysis codes. Various computer based analytical and simulation programs are available and have been used successfully in characterizing ablative materials and their erosion, char, and thermal protection characteristics. Typical programs that have been used for this purpose are: Charring Material Ablator (CMA), Aerothermal Chemical Equilibrium (ACE), Momentum and Energy Integral Techniques (MEIT) (ACE and MEIT are used in conjunction with the CMA program), and PATRAN (geometry of nozzle, a general model for structural and thermal analysis). Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a discipline that is finding increasing usage in evaluating the exhaust flow in SRM nozzles and in determining potential heat transfer to nozzle components. These techniques are important tools for the designer who is applying ablative composites to solid rocket motor nozzles.[D]As shown on Figures 1 and 2, the aluminum structure of the SRM nozzle is protected from the heat of the expanding gasses by a series of carbon cloth phenolic rings backed up by glass or silica cloth phenolic rings. The glass and silica cloth phenolic backup rings are provided for structural, insulation, and galvanic corrosion protection. In lieu of one single ring, a series of rings is used for ease of manufacture and handling. Factors of safety for ablative carbon cloth phenolic vary between approximately 1.5 and 2.0 for erosion and are usually about 1.25 for char, depending upon the location of the ablative carbon cloth phenolic in the nozzle. Generally, the factors of safety in the entrance section of the nozzle are higher than in the exit section.The optimum angle between the plies and the flame surface in SRM nozzles using ablative carbon cloth phenolic has been proven to be between 30 degrees and 60 degrees, depending upon the location, contour and heating conditions at various sections of the nozzle.[D]Manufacture of Carbon Cloth:The carbon cloth used to fabricate composite solid rocket motor nozzles is impregnated with the binder or matrix prior to wrap and cure. This preimpregnated material is commonly called \"prepreg\" in the composite industry. The diversity of the manufacturing process requires six different vendors before final material is produced. These vendors: 1) produce rayon thread; 2) weave cloth; 3) carbonize cloth; 4) produce resin; 5) produce carbon fillers; and 6) impregnate carbon cloth with resin and filler (production of prepreg). Constant monitoring of all phases of the manufacturing process is required to ensure satisfactory quality. The rayon thread is manufactured, then woven into cloth 60 in. wide. The rayon cloth is carbonized by slowly heating to 1000 deg. to 1500 deg. C in an inert atmosphere. Critical factors to be controlled in this process are the rate of temperature increase, time, and maintenance of an inert atmosphere in the oven.After carbonization, the carbon-cloth is impregnated by drawing it through a heated container of phenolic resin and carbon filler to form prepreg. Critical factors that must be carefully controlled in the preimpregnation process are temperature of the resin/filler mixture, tension and speed of the cloth through the resin/filler mixture, pressure on the roller to ensure penetration of resin into the cloth, oven temperature after impregnation to remove volatiles, and control staging of the resin. The prepreg should meet the uncured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 1 and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in Table 2. However, it should be pointed out that since the structural minimum - maximum properties shown on Table 2 vary by factors greater than 2 indicate that additional material, process and cure controls improvements are required to narrow the variation in material capabilities.Table 1.

Potential shelf life may be extended if the material meets the retest properties of Table 1. The prepreg tape rolls should be cut on a 45 deg. bias in widths of 3 in. and 12 in. The bias cut allows the cloth to stretch and conform to the different mandrels, and the narrow widths help avoid wrinkling and folding of the material during the wrapping process. The rolled prepreg is bagged with desiccant and stored in an environmentally controlled cold storage until it is required for processing.Glass Cloth Phenolic:The glass cloth phenolic shown in Figure 2 is used to provide structural integrity, a corrosion barrier, and insulation. It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 5.Table 2.

It is fabricated in a manner similar to that of carbon cloth phenolic. The product should conform to the uncured material acceptance test data properties and the cured material acceptance test data properties shown in reference 6. The silica cloth phenolic is a higher purity material than the glass cloth phenolic, and is only used in the cowl ring.Nozzle Ablative Composites Fabrication:The fabrication process for the components of the nozzle includes two tape wrappings and two machining operations. Because of the sensitive variables occurring during tape wrapping of the prepreg tape, a highly skilled operator is required who understands what is required when one of the variables changes. The critical manufacturing variables are heat input, cooling input, roller pressure, machine speed, and tape tension. There are many other random variables that play a less significant role. The material is wrapped onto a mandrel which has been machined to the desired contour of the component as specified in the manufacturing plan. Depending upon the component location, the first wrap could be either bias-cut carbon cloth phenolic, glass cloth phenolic, or silica cloth phenolic tape wrapped on the mandrel at a specified angle (which depends upon the nozzle component) to the centerline of the nozzle. Enough tape should be wrapped to provide machining stock and tag ends after cure.The tape wrapping process places the tape at the proper angle and debulks the tape material to minimize movement of the tape during cure. Debulking of the tape should be achieved by applying heat and pressure at the point of contact with the mandrel or the previous ply. Heat should be applied prior to wrapping to make the tape tacky. The pressure roller forces the fibers to nest and compact (debulk) within the resin/fabric matrix. CO2 is used to cool the resin to stop further cure, and dimensionally and thermally stabilizes the billet for further processing. All ablative components are cured in a hydroclave except the aft exit cone, outer boot ring, and the cowl, which are cured in an autoclave.After wrapping, the billet and mandrel are vacuum bagged for waterproofing, then installed in a hydroclave for final cure. Curing of the carbon-cloth liner requires a pressure of 1000 psi at 310 deg. F for a minimum of five hours. After the cure cycle, a test ring should be removed and tested to verify the properties of the cured carbon cloth phenolic. The carbon cloth is then machined to configuration.In preparation for the second wrap, a coat of phenolic resin is applied to the machined surface of the first layer of phenolic. The second layer of phenolic tape is wrapped at the desired angle to the nozzle centerline using the same process as described for the carbon-cloth phenolic. The component is vacuum bagged and cured in an autoclave at 250 psi at a temperature of 310 deg. F for approximately four hours. Carbon and glass rings should be removed and tested to verify properties of the cure. The billet is final machined, removed from the mandrel and x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations and low density indications. Following x-ray, the machined component is ready for bonding to the metal housings. Bonding of the machined ablative component to the metal housing is accomplished in a clean environment and requires strict process control.Inspection, Destructive, And Non-Destructive Evaluation:A very important development in nondestructive testing that promises to help maintain the meticulous cleanliness required to ensure bonding of composites to adjacent metallic structures is computer controlled scanning of the metal surface with devices based on Optically Stimulated Electron Emission (OSEE) principle. Computer controlled contamination scanning (CONSCAN) is a system developed by MSFC using the OSEE technique for automated scanning of metal surfaces prior to critical bonding operations. The CONSCAN system provides the sensitivity and spacial resolution necessary when scanning large areas to ensure that surfaces are sufficiently free of contaminants that reduce bond strength. Scanning the surface with CONSCAN provides a map of surface contamination levels, which clearly identifies those areas that require further cleaning. Rescanning after the additional cleaning operation provides results of that recleaning. These data provide a permanent record of surface cleanliness levels. The data records may be used at a later date to help identify the specific process during which contamination occurred and to correlate surface cleanliness levels with subsequent debond locations.The carbon cloth prepreg, glass cloth prepreg, and silica cloth prepreg should be visually inspected to ensure that there are no broken fibers, voids, or lack of resin or filler. Coupons of these materials should also be tested to verify uncured and cured properties. After final machining of both glass cloth and carbon cloth wraps, the materials should be x-rayed to verify absence of voids, delaminations, and low density areas. Defects of this type may be cause for rejection and scrappage. An alcohol wipe may be performed on the finished surface. Collection of alcohol in a spot or line before drying, will indicate a crevice or void in the surface. The x-ray technician should be highly skilled in taking and reading the x-rays to avoid scrapping an expensive component due to erroneous low density indications. Low density indications could be caused by fiber ends not being flush with next butt end and the gap being filled with resin and filler, density variations, and interlaminar resin-rich areas.The tag ends and rings removed after curing should be used to verify mechanical properties. Tag ends and rings could also be used for plasma torch testing to verify the erosion rate and the factor of safety.Technical Rationale:Precision design and manufacturing procedures for ablative material for solid rocket motor nozzles have been developed over a period of 30 years. The design of the ablative material depends upon factors such as the solid propellant composition; combustion gas temperature, velocity and composition; and relative position of the material in the nozzle. Problems that have surfaced over the years were analyzed, improvements proposed; and, when approved through the NASA change board process, were designed, prototyped, ground tested and flown. Information for this practice was derived from a number of sources, including procurement specifications and manufacturing plans for the SRM and RSRM experimental studies, problem reporting and corrective action (PRACA) reports at MSFC, AIAA reports, and from personal interviews and telephone interviews with individuals from MSFC organizations and contractor organizations.References:Hall, William B.: \"Standardization of the Carbon-Phenolic Materials and Processes, Volume I, Experimental Studies,\" Professor of Chemical Engineering, Mississippi State University, August 31, 1988.Kelly, P. and Thompson, A.: \"AIAA 89-2661 Low Density Indications in Radiographs of Solid Rocket Motor Ablatives,\" 25th Joint Propulsion Conference, Morton Thiokol Inc., July 10-12, 1989.TWR-10341 (CD) Rev.

    "lessons_learned": "Impact of Non-Practice:Not adhering to the proven practices for the design, manufacture, and testing of ablative composite materials could result in low material density, separation of fibers, and contamination. These defects could cause expensive scrappage and possible schedule delays. The ultimate impact of not adhering to precise in-process controls could be burn-through of the nozzle causing loss of mission, vehicle, and life.",
    "recomendations": "Practice:Fabrication of ablative composite materials for solid rocket motor nozzles requires a precision, integrated, multi-disciplinary, multivendor approach to design and manufacture. Creation of the material requires stringent process controls during manufacture of the rayon fiber, weaving the rayon fiber into cloth, carbonizing the rayon cloth, impregnation of carbon cloth with resin and filler, wrapping the carbon-phenolic onto a mandrel to the proper thickness, curing, nondestructive inspection and final machining to the designed configuration. Environmental conditions and cleanliness levels must be closely monitored when bonding the ablative material to the metal housing. The critical material properties for acceptance of carbon cloth-phenolic prepreg material are cloth content, dry resin solids content, volatile content, carbon filler content, and resin flow. Use of certified and highly skilled tape wrapping operators, bonding technicians, machinists, and destructive and nondestructive testing personnel, is a must.",

This requires a new choice of \"other\" part combinations in the circuit each time the stress on a new part is determined.

Therefore, it is essential that the conservative approach of using worst-case stresses be implemented as standard practice.Although average temperatures during a mission may be nominal, typical qualification test philosophy results in test temperatures that stress the design to assure margin against possible flight contingencies (typically 75 degrees C). It is essential that negligible aging of the parts be introduced during protoflight testing to assure mission reserve life.

    "driving_event": "This Lesson Learned is based on Reliability Practice number PD-AP-1303, from NASA Technical Memorandum 4322A, Reliability Preferred Practices for Design and Test.Part failure rates are proportional to their applied electrical and thermal stresses. By predicting the stress through analysis, and applying conservative stresses, the probability of mission success can be greatly enhanced.Electrical circuits are analyzed to determine the maximum stress on each part when all applied voltages or currents are maximized and when all variations of other parts in the circuit are set to that combination of minimum and maximum values that produce worst-case maximum stress. This requires a new choice of \"other\" part combinations in the circuit each time the stress on a new part is determined. The stresses are aggravated by imposing maximum operating temperature when comparing the part stress to its required derating. The initial analysis usually is made without benefit of a detailed part level thermal analysis; therefore, a conservative temperature assumption is made. Highly stressed parts are identified for possible replacement with more robust parts or for possible circuit changes. The final design is confirmed by analysis, with part temperatures based on a part level thermal analysis, and with voltages and currents derived from either specification limits or the results of worst-case circuit analysis.Numerous life tests have been performed on electrical parts that establish the relationship of part life to applied stresses. There is a very strong dependence. The life expectancy typically can be doubled or tripled by operating at half the manufacturers full rated (100 percent) stresses, which typically are commensurate with a 10,000-hour life expectancy. Complex, multiple year missions must achieve very low part failure rates to achieve mission goals; therefore, operation at derated conditions is mandatory. Although typical reliability predictions are based on nominal stresses, circuit nonlinearities and part and voltage variations can cause large operating point variations.

    "subject": "TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft Handling Anomaly Special Review Board Final Report of May 29, 1992",
    "abstract": "Support equipment was damaged during a lift because the fixture assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.The lesson provides 7 recommendations involving the need for stability analysis, formal mechanical GSE design reviews, peer review of lifting fixture design, high fidelity dry runs, and involvement of host center personnel.",
    "driving_event": "On Sunday March 8, 1992 the TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft was being prepared for thermal vacuum (T/V) testing by a test team in Building 10 of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As part of the procedure, the T/V Fixture Assembly consisting of the spacecraft, thermal test shrouding and instrumentation mounted on the Spacecraft Horizontal Support Structure (SHSS), suspended by four vertical cables from an H-frame spreader bar was lifted and positioned above the T/V chamber. At approximately 11:25 a.m., during final north / south crane positioning maneuvers, the suspended assembly began a slow overturning rotation. The assembly rotated approximately 135 degrees from horizontal before being halted by the entanglement of one of the four suspension cables with the SHSS. After some bouncing and jostling, it came to rest at approximately 115 degrees.While resting in this anomalous position (+X end up), the Test Team visually determined that the H frame spreader bar assembly had sustained considerable damage during the rotation and might fail. A decision was made by the Spacecraft Manager to remove the vertical load from the overstressed and damaged H frame spreader assembly as quickly as possible by lowering the spacecraft and test fixture to the chamber floor. Within ten minutes of the overturning incident the Test Team, augmented by personnel from a GSFC contractor, lowered the rotated assembly to the chamber floor where it was temporarily secured. During the subsequent visual inspection of the secured assembly it was noted that sections of the thermal test shroud and support fixturing had partially yielded. However, no apparent damage to the spacecraft or to the lower frame of the SHSS could be seen.An on site \"failure review board\" of civil servant and contractor personnel was convened to review and discuss the situation. A decision was made by the board that the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly should be removed and reoriented to a horizontal position outside of the chamber to minimize any further yielding of the supporting structures. A rigging crew was on the scene at this time, and was given the go ahead by the board to proceed with the removal of the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly from the chamber.The damaged H-frame spreader bar and the four suspension cables were removed. A pair of nylon slings were attached from the +X end of the SHSS to the crane hook and the Spacecraft/Thermal Shroud/SHSS assembly was raised vertically out of the T/V chamber and moved directly adjacent to it. The assembly remained there suspended a few inches above the floor while the team attached additional slings from the -X end of the SHSS to a forklift positioned on the -Z side of the load. By alternating operations of the crane and the forklift, the spacecraft and fixture were reoriented horizontally and lowered to the floor. At approximately 6:51 p.m. the operation was completed with the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly safely on the floor in the normal attitude. A video recording of both the anomaly and the recovery operation was made and is available from the TOPEX Project office for viewing.",
    "lessons_learned": "Root Cause of Problem:The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing Factors:A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T/V lift was not performed.The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied.A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber.Additional Observations:The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency.No precursor run through (dry run) of the T/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.)Just prior to the final crane move, the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test.Lessons Learned:GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations.Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation.Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration.Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention.Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them.Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved.The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result.An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use.Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle.Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered.Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded. The video recording of the overturning anomaly and the preceding and following activities was extremely helpful in the investigation and evaluation of this incident. Since mishaps may also occur during normal operations, consideration should be given to video recording all operations involving unique high value equipment. Use of inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras and recorders would permit very economical routine video recording of all activitiesThe TOPEX/POSEIDON overturning incident had the potential for being classified as a NASA Type A Mishap. Only a series of uncontrolled, but fortunate occurrences prevented this from initially being a much more serious anomaly with severe consequences.Major damage to both the spacecraft and the T/V chamber were avoided only because the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted higher than necessary to clear the lip of the chamber. This was done in the erroneous belief that the higher lift (shorter crane to assembly distance) would improve stability by reducing swaying of the load. If the lift had been at the same height as the dry run, the T/V Fixture Assembly might have struck the chamber lip during the rollover resulting in major damage to both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The H-Frame spreader bar was severely damaged, and probably would have failed completely if one of the suspension cables had not snagged on one of the upper SHSS clevis lugs. Complete failure of the spreader bar would have dropped the 8000 pound load approximately equal to 40 feet to the floor of the T/V chamber, destroying both the Spacecraft and the chamber.The Spacecraft fortuitously rolled with the -X side down, where a significant amount of GSE structure was mounted. If the Spacecraft had rotated with the +X side down (or if it had fully inverted) placing it on the floor of the T/V chamber to relieve the loads on the H-Frame spreader bar might not have been possible without significant additional damage to the spacecraft.Following the anomaly only the quick and professional response of the test team and contractor personnel prevented further (and potentially severe) damage to the Spacecraft and chamber facility.",
    "recomendations": "FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONSRoot Cause of Problem.- The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing CausesLack of Stability Analysis - A stability analysis of the total T/V Fixture Assembly (T/V Lift Fixture, Cables, SHSS, Satellite, supporting thermal shrouds, and instrumentation) was not performed, reviewed, or approved prior to the overturning incident.Recommendation: A Stability analysis must be performed on all lifting devices in all lift configurations and must be repeated with each new application assigned. A stability factor of 1.5 or greater should be analytically demonstrated to cover possible differences between analysis and the actual lifted assembly. The stability analysis should be treated as a formal mandatory item in the same manner that stress analysis is addressed.Inadequate Stability Testing - Stability testing was done during the proof loading tests of the lifting fixture, and again with the complete T/V Fixture Assembly. Because the impact of clevis friction was not taken into account, neither of these tests revealed the underlying instability. The two \"rocking\" tests were not analyzed for their adequacy in determining fixture instability.Recommendation: Detailed review of all elements of planned testing must be done to assure the testing will accomplish the goals of the test. Stability analysis of lifted assemblies should be done whether or not stability testing is planned. This analysis is essential to determine the need for and the adequacy of any stability testing.Continued Postponement of GSE Review - A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V Fixture Assembly was repeatedly Postponed, and not held prior to use of the Assembly for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber. (In preparation for thermal vacuum testing an Environmental Test Readiness Review was held November 20-21, 1991. There was one page that addressed the entire mechanical GSE in the review documentation. This page was simply a listing of the mechanical GSE and its status.) A supplemental handout available at the November 20, 1991, Environmental Test Readiness Review (ETRR) included an assembly drawing of the lift configuration, but the drawing reproduction did not clearly show the cable attach points. A viewgraph of the lift configuration drawing was not shown at the ETRR. However, it was shown at the previous Monthly Status Review (MSR).Recommendation: Formal mechanical GSE design reviews must be held to assure adequate design evaluation of the proposed lifting configurations. Discussions must include a detailed review of the proposed drawings and procedures for specific attach points, stability analyses, direction of motion, and expected accelerations for all moves.Lack of Designer Experience and Peer Reviews - The Principal Engineer was not familiar with stability analysis of lifting fixtures for loads lifted below the C.G. and did not follow the lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook. Furthermore, no peer review, internal contractor review, or project review of the total T/V Fixture Assembly occurred. The review process failed.Recommendation: Accepted guidelines should be followed in the design of all lifting fixtures. This is especially true when the designer has not designed a lifting fixture before and is unfamiliar with the shortfalls of various lifting fixture configurations. In all cases, a review of the design and margins should be held with peers and supervision to assure the design meets all requirements. A checklist which includes all aspects of the design e.g., stability, loads analysis, proof loading, etc. should be developed.GSE Project reviews should be held and attended by personnel who are capable of assessing the adequacy of the design being reviewed.Lack of Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration (dry run) of the chamber lift activities was not performed prior to the incident. However, a lift of the T/V Fixture Assembly (without the spacecraft) was done earlier for a form fit of the SHSS and thermal shrouds. There were significant, differences in C.G., fixture alignment, and personnel assignments between this lift and the actual spacecraft lift.Recommendation: A high fidelity dry run, using the lifting fixture with the proper mass and C.G. simulator and following the procedures that will be used for the actual lift should be conducted. A formal briefing before the dry run and debriefing after the dry run of the personnel involved should be made for all high value one of a kind spacecraft and equipment.On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Lack of Host Center Review of Hazardous Operations Procedures - The host center (GSFC) did not review the hazardous procedures/operations planned by the outside user organizations. Also the GSFC did not require advance notification of the Center Code 205 or 302 safety organizations of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation.Recommendation: Host center personnel should be required to review all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organization. Host center personnel are much more familiar with the characteristics (and quirks, if any) of their equipment and facilities. Also, they are more likely than the visiting organization to be highly experienced in the type of operations involved. A requirement for formal Host Center \"Buy-Off\" (signature of concurrence) would help ensure proper visibility and attention to hazardous procedures/operations.In addition, the development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Advance notification would allow the safety organization the option of monitoring or witnessing selected hazardous activities and ensuring that all internal and external safety requirements are being satisfied.Remaining Spacecraft Handling Operations: At this time the T/V spacecraft handling equipment has been redesigned, tested, analyzed, reviewed and used to move the spacecraft back into the T/V Chamber.Recommendation: The TOPEX Project must examine and approve the stability analysis for all remaining handling configurations, including those at the launch site. A GSE review should be conducted for all remaining handling operations as soon as possible.",

    "abstract": "Support equipment was damaged during a lift because the fixture assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.The lesson provides 7 recommendations involving the need for stability analysis, formal mechanical GSE design reviews, peer review of lifting fixture design, high fidelity dry runs, and involvement of host center personnel.",
    "driving_event": "On Sunday March 8, 1992 the TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft was being prepared for thermal vacuum (T/V) testing by a test team in Building 10 of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As part of the procedure, the T/V Fixture Assembly consisting of the spacecraft, thermal test shrouding and instrumentation mounted on the Spacecraft Horizontal Support Structure (SHSS), suspended by four vertical cables from an H-frame spreader bar was lifted and positioned above the T/V chamber. At approximately 11:25 a.m., during final north / south crane positioning maneuvers, the suspended assembly began a slow overturning rotation. The assembly rotated approximately 135 degrees from horizontal before being halted by the entanglement of one of the four suspension cables with the SHSS. After some bouncing and jostling, it came to rest at approximately 115 degrees.While resting in this anomalous position (+X end up), the Test Team visually determined that the H frame spreader bar assembly had sustained considerable damage during the rotation and might fail. A decision was made by the Spacecraft Manager to remove the vertical load from the overstressed and damaged H frame spreader assembly as quickly as possible by lowering the spacecraft and test fixture to the chamber floor. Within ten minutes of the overturning incident the Test Team, augmented by personnel from a GSFC contractor, lowered the rotated assembly to the chamber floor where it was temporarily secured. During the subsequent visual inspection of the secured assembly it was noted that sections of the thermal test shroud and support fixturing had partially yielded. However, no apparent damage to the spacecraft or to the lower frame of the SHSS could be seen.An on site \"failure review board\" of civil servant and contractor personnel was convened to review and discuss the situation. A decision was made by the board that the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly should be removed and reoriented to a horizontal position outside of the chamber to minimize any further yielding of the supporting structures. A rigging crew was on the scene at this time, and was given the go ahead by the board to proceed with the removal of the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly from the chamber.The damaged H-frame spreader bar and the four suspension cables were removed. A pair of nylon slings were attached from the +X end of the SHSS to the crane hook and the Spacecraft/Thermal Shroud/SHSS assembly was raised vertically out of the T/V chamber and moved directly adjacent to it. The assembly remained there suspended a few inches above the floor while the team attached additional slings from the -X end of the SHSS to a forklift positioned on the -Z side of the load. By alternating operations of the crane and the forklift, the spacecraft and fixture were reoriented horizontally and lowered to the floor. At approximately 6:51 p.m. the operation was completed with the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly safely on the floor in the normal attitude. A video recording of both the anomaly and the recovery operation was made and is available from the TOPEX Project office for viewing.",
    "lessons_learned": "Root Cause of Problem:The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing Factors:A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T/V lift was not performed.The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied.A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber.Additional Observations:The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency.No precursor run through (dry run) of the T/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.)Just prior to the final crane move, the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test.Lessons Learned:GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations.Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation.Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration.Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention.Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them.Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved.The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result.An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use.Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle.Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered.Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded.

Complete failure of the spreader bar would have dropped the 8000 pound load approximately equal to 40 feet to the floor of the T/V chamber, destroying both the Spacecraft and the chamber.The Spacecraft fortuitously rolled with the -X side down, where a significant amount of GSE structure was mounted. If the Spacecraft had rotated with the +X side down (or if it had fully inverted) placing it on the floor of the T/V chamber to relieve the loads on the H-Frame spreader bar might not have been possible without significant additional damage to the spacecraft.Following the anomaly only the quick and professional response of the test team and contractor personnel prevented further (and potentially severe) damage to the Spacecraft and chamber facility.",
    "recomendations": "FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONSRoot Cause of Problem.- The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing CausesLack of Stability Analysis - A stability analysis of the total T/V Fixture Assembly (T/V Lift Fixture, Cables, SHSS, Satellite, supporting thermal shrouds, and instrumentation) was not performed, reviewed, or approved prior to the overturning incident.Recommendation: A Stability analysis must be performed on all lifting devices in all lift configurations and must be repeated with each new application assigned. A stability factor of 1.5 or greater should be analytically demonstrated to cover possible differences between analysis and the actual lifted assembly. The stability analysis should be treated as a formal mandatory item in the same manner that stress analysis is addressed.Inadequate Stability Testing - Stability testing was done during the proof loading tests of the lifting fixture, and again with the complete T/V Fixture Assembly. Because the impact of clevis friction was not taken into account, neither of these tests revealed the underlying instability. The two \"rocking\" tests were not analyzed for their adequacy in determining fixture instability.Recommendation: Detailed review of all elements of planned testing must be done to assure the testing will accomplish the goals of the test. Stability analysis of lifted assemblies should be done whether or not stability testing is planned. This analysis is essential to determine the need for and the adequacy of any stability testing.Continued Postponement of GSE Review - A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V Fixture Assembly was repeatedly Postponed, and not held prior to use of the Assembly for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber. (In preparation for thermal vacuum testing an Environmental Test Readiness Review was held November 20-21, 1991. There was one page that addressed the entire mechanical GSE in the review documentation. This page was simply a listing of the mechanical GSE and its status.) A supplemental handout available at the November 20, 1991, Environmental Test Readiness Review (ETRR) included an assembly drawing of the lift configuration, but the drawing reproduction did not clearly show the cable attach points. A viewgraph of the lift configuration drawing was not shown at the ETRR. However, it was shown at the previous Monthly Status Review (MSR).Recommendation: Formal mechanical GSE design reviews must be held to assure adequate design evaluation of the proposed lifting configurations. Discussions must include a detailed review of the proposed drawings and procedures for specific attach points, stability analyses, direction of motion, and expected accelerations for all moves.Lack of Designer Experience and Peer Reviews - The Principal Engineer was not familiar with stability analysis of lifting fixtures for loads lifted below the C.G. and did not follow the lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook. Furthermore, no peer review, internal contractor review, or project review of the total T/V Fixture Assembly occurred. The review process failed.Recommendation: Accepted guidelines should be followed in the design of all lifting fixtures. This is especially true when the designer has not designed a lifting fixture before and is unfamiliar with the shortfalls of various lifting fixture configurations. In all cases, a review of the design and margins should be held with peers and supervision to assure the design meets all requirements. A checklist which includes all aspects of the design e.g., stability, loads analysis, proof loading, etc. should be developed.GSE Project reviews should be held and attended by personnel who are capable of assessing the adequacy of the design being reviewed.Lack of Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration (dry run) of the chamber lift activities was not performed prior to the incident. However, a lift of the T/V Fixture Assembly (without the spacecraft) was done earlier for a form fit of the SHSS and thermal shrouds. There were significant, differences in C.G., fixture alignment, and personnel assignments between this lift and the actual spacecraft lift.Recommendation: A high fidelity dry run, using the lifting fixture with the proper mass and C.G. simulator and following the procedures that will be used for the actual lift should be conducted. A formal briefing before the dry run and debriefing after the dry run of the personnel involved should be made for all high value one of a kind spacecraft and equipment.On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Lack of Host Center Review of Hazardous Operations Procedures - The host center (GSFC) did not review the hazardous procedures/operations planned by the outside user organizations. Also the GSFC did not require advance notification of the Center Code 205 or 302 safety organizations of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation.Recommendation: Host center personnel should be required to review all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organization. Host center personnel are much more familiar with the characteristics (and quirks, if any) of their equipment and facilities. Also, they are more likely than the visiting organization to be highly experienced in the type of operations involved. A requirement for formal Host Center \"Buy-Off\" (signature of concurrence) would help ensure proper visibility and attention to hazardous procedures/operations.In addition, the development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Advance notification would allow the safety organization the option of monitoring or witnessing selected hazardous activities and ensuring that all internal and external safety requirements are being satisfied.Remaining Spacecraft Handling Operations: At this time the T/V spacecraft handling equipment has been redesigned, tested, analyzed, reviewed and used to move the spacecraft back into the T/V Chamber.Recommendation: The TOPEX Project must examine and approve the stability analysis for all remaining handling configurations, including those at the launch site. A GSE review should be conducted for all remaining handling operations as soon as possible.",

    "abstract": "Support equipment was damaged during a lift because the fixture assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.The lesson provides 7 recommendations involving the need for stability analysis, formal mechanical GSE design reviews, peer review of lifting fixture design, high fidelity dry runs, and involvement of host center personnel.",
    "driving_event": "On Sunday March 8, 1992 the TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft was being prepared for thermal vacuum (T/V) testing by a test team in Building 10 of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As part of the procedure, the T/V Fixture Assembly consisting of the spacecraft, thermal test shrouding and instrumentation mounted on the Spacecraft Horizontal Support Structure (SHSS), suspended by four vertical cables from an H-frame spreader bar was lifted and positioned above the T/V chamber. At approximately 11:25 a.m., during final north / south crane positioning maneuvers, the suspended assembly began a slow overturning rotation. The assembly rotated approximately 135 degrees from horizontal before being halted by the entanglement of one of the four suspension cables with the SHSS. After some bouncing and jostling, it came to rest at approximately 115 degrees.While resting in this anomalous position (+X end up), the Test Team visually determined that the H frame spreader bar assembly had sustained considerable damage during the rotation and might fail. A decision was made by the Spacecraft Manager to remove the vertical load from the overstressed and damaged H frame spreader assembly as quickly as possible by lowering the spacecraft and test fixture to the chamber floor. Within ten minutes of the overturning incident the Test Team, augmented by personnel from a GSFC contractor, lowered the rotated assembly to the chamber floor where it was temporarily secured. During the subsequent visual inspection of the secured assembly it was noted that sections of the thermal test shroud and support fixturing had partially yielded. However, no apparent damage to the spacecraft or to the lower frame of the SHSS could be seen.An on site \"failure review board\" of civil servant and contractor personnel was convened to review and discuss the situation. A decision was made by the board that the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly should be removed and reoriented to a horizontal position outside of the chamber to minimize any further yielding of the supporting structures. A rigging crew was on the scene at this time, and was given the go ahead by the board to proceed with the removal of the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly from the chamber.The damaged H-frame spreader bar and the four suspension cables were removed. A pair of nylon slings were attached from the +X end of the SHSS to the crane hook and the Spacecraft/Thermal Shroud/SHSS assembly was raised vertically out of the T/V chamber and moved directly adjacent to it. The assembly remained there suspended a few inches above the floor while the team attached additional slings from the -X end of the SHSS to a forklift positioned on the -Z side of the load. By alternating operations of the crane and the forklift, the spacecraft and fixture were reoriented horizontally and lowered to the floor. At approximately 6:51 p.m. the operation was completed with the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly safely on the floor in the normal attitude. A video recording of both the anomaly and the recovery operation was made and is available from the TOPEX Project office for viewing.",
    "lessons_learned": "Root Cause of Problem:The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing Factors:A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T/V lift was not performed.The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied.A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber.Additional Observations:The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency.No precursor run through (dry run) of the T/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.)Just prior to the final crane move, the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test.Lessons Learned:GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations.Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation.Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration.Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention.Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them.Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved.The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result.An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use.Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle.Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered.Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded. The video recording of the overturning anomaly and the preceding and following activities was extremely helpful in the investigation and evaluation of this incident. Since mishaps may also occur during normal operations, consideration should be given to video recording all operations involving unique high value equipment. Use of inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras and recorders would permit very economical routine video recording of all activitiesThe TOPEX/POSEIDON overturning incident had the potential for being classified as a NASA Type A Mishap. Only a series of uncontrolled, but fortunate occurrences prevented this from initially being a much more serious anomaly with severe consequences.Major damage to both the spacecraft and the T/V chamber were avoided only because the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted higher than necessary to clear the lip of the chamber. This was done in the erroneous belief that the higher lift (shorter crane to assembly distance) would improve stability by reducing swaying of the load. If the lift had been at the same height as the dry run, the T/V Fixture Assembly might have struck the chamber lip during the rollover resulting in major damage to both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The H-Frame spreader bar was severely damaged, and probably would have failed completely if one of the suspension cables had not snagged on one of the upper SHSS clevis lugs.

A stability factor of 1.5 or greater should be analytically demonstrated to cover possible differences between analysis and the actual lifted assembly. The stability analysis should be treated as a formal mandatory item in the same manner that stress analysis is addressed.Inadequate Stability Testing - Stability testing was done during the proof loading tests of the lifting fixture, and again with the complete T/V Fixture Assembly. Because the impact of clevis friction was not taken into account, neither of these tests revealed the underlying instability. The two \"rocking\" tests were not analyzed for their adequacy in determining fixture instability.Recommendation: Detailed review of all elements of planned testing must be done to assure the testing will accomplish the goals of the test. Stability analysis of lifted assemblies should be done whether or not stability testing is planned. This analysis is essential to determine the need for and the adequacy of any stability testing.Continued Postponement of GSE Review - A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V Fixture Assembly was repeatedly Postponed, and not held prior to use of the Assembly for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber. (In preparation for thermal vacuum testing an Environmental Test Readiness Review was held November 20-21, 1991. There was one page that addressed the entire mechanical GSE in the review documentation. This page was simply a listing of the mechanical GSE and its status.) A supplemental handout available at the November 20, 1991, Environmental Test Readiness Review (ETRR) included an assembly drawing of the lift configuration, but the drawing reproduction did not clearly show the cable attach points. A viewgraph of the lift configuration drawing was not shown at the ETRR. However, it was shown at the previous Monthly Status Review (MSR).Recommendation: Formal mechanical GSE design reviews must be held to assure adequate design evaluation of the proposed lifting configurations. Discussions must include a detailed review of the proposed drawings and procedures for specific attach points, stability analyses, direction of motion, and expected accelerations for all moves.Lack of Designer Experience and Peer Reviews - The Principal Engineer was not familiar with stability analysis of lifting fixtures for loads lifted below the C.G. and did not follow the lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook. Furthermore, no peer review, internal contractor review, or project review of the total T/V Fixture Assembly occurred. The review process failed.Recommendation: Accepted guidelines should be followed in the design of all lifting fixtures. This is especially true when the designer has not designed a lifting fixture before and is unfamiliar with the shortfalls of various lifting fixture configurations. In all cases, a review of the design and margins should be held with peers and supervision to assure the design meets all requirements. A checklist which includes all aspects of the design e.g., stability, loads analysis, proof loading, etc. should be developed.GSE Project reviews should be held and attended by personnel who are capable of assessing the adequacy of the design being reviewed.Lack of Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration (dry run) of the chamber lift activities was not performed prior to the incident. However, a lift of the T/V Fixture Assembly (without the spacecraft) was done earlier for a form fit of the SHSS and thermal shrouds. There were significant, differences in C.G., fixture alignment, and personnel assignments between this lift and the actual spacecraft lift.Recommendation: A high fidelity dry run, using the lifting fixture with the proper mass and C.G. simulator and following the procedures that will be used for the actual lift should be conducted. A formal briefing before the dry run and debriefing after the dry run of the personnel involved should be made for all high value one of a kind spacecraft and equipment.On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Lack of Host Center Review of Hazardous Operations Procedures - The host center (GSFC) did not review the hazardous procedures/operations planned by the outside user organizations. Also the GSFC did not require advance notification of the Center Code 205 or 302 safety organizations of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation.Recommendation: Host center personnel should be required to review all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organization. Host center personnel are much more familiar with the characteristics (and quirks, if any) of their equipment and facilities. Also, they are more likely than the visiting organization to be highly experienced in the type of operations involved. A requirement for formal Host Center \"Buy-Off\" (signature of concurrence) would help ensure proper visibility and attention to hazardous procedures/operations.In addition, the development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Advance notification would allow the safety organization the option of monitoring or witnessing selected hazardous activities and ensuring that all internal and external safety requirements are being satisfied.Remaining Spacecraft Handling Operations: At this time the T/V spacecraft handling equipment has been redesigned, tested, analyzed, reviewed and used to move the spacecraft back into the T/V Chamber.Recommendation: The TOPEX Project must examine and approve the stability analysis for all remaining handling configurations, including those at the launch site. A GSE review should be conducted for all remaining handling operations as soon as possible.",

    "abstract": "Support equipment was damaged during a lift because the fixture assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.The lesson provides 7 recommendations involving the need for stability analysis, formal mechanical GSE design reviews, peer review of lifting fixture design, high fidelity dry runs, and involvement of host center personnel.",
    "driving_event": "On Sunday March 8, 1992 the TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft was being prepared for thermal vacuum (T/V) testing by a test team in Building 10 of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As part of the procedure, the T/V Fixture Assembly consisting of the spacecraft, thermal test shrouding and instrumentation mounted on the Spacecraft Horizontal Support Structure (SHSS), suspended by four vertical cables from an H-frame spreader bar was lifted and positioned above the T/V chamber. At approximately 11:25 a.m., during final north / south crane positioning maneuvers, the suspended assembly began a slow overturning rotation. The assembly rotated approximately 135 degrees from horizontal before being halted by the entanglement of one of the four suspension cables with the SHSS. After some bouncing and jostling, it came to rest at approximately 115 degrees.While resting in this anomalous position (+X end up), the Test Team visually determined that the H frame spreader bar assembly had sustained considerable damage during the rotation and might fail. A decision was made by the Spacecraft Manager to remove the vertical load from the overstressed and damaged H frame spreader assembly as quickly as possible by lowering the spacecraft and test fixture to the chamber floor. Within ten minutes of the overturning incident the Test Team, augmented by personnel from a GSFC contractor, lowered the rotated assembly to the chamber floor where it was temporarily secured. During the subsequent visual inspection of the secured assembly it was noted that sections of the thermal test shroud and support fixturing had partially yielded. However, no apparent damage to the spacecraft or to the lower frame of the SHSS could be seen.An on site \"failure review board\" of civil servant and contractor personnel was convened to review and discuss the situation. A decision was made by the board that the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly should be removed and reoriented to a horizontal position outside of the chamber to minimize any further yielding of the supporting structures. A rigging crew was on the scene at this time, and was given the go ahead by the board to proceed with the removal of the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly from the chamber.The damaged H-frame spreader bar and the four suspension cables were removed. A pair of nylon slings were attached from the +X end of the SHSS to the crane hook and the Spacecraft/Thermal Shroud/SHSS assembly was raised vertically out of the T/V chamber and moved directly adjacent to it. The assembly remained there suspended a few inches above the floor while the team attached additional slings from the -X end of the SHSS to a forklift positioned on the -Z side of the load. By alternating operations of the crane and the forklift, the spacecraft and fixture were reoriented horizontally and lowered to the floor. At approximately 6:51 p.m. the operation was completed with the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly safely on the floor in the normal attitude. A video recording of both the anomaly and the recovery operation was made and is available from the TOPEX Project office for viewing.",
    "lessons_learned": "Root Cause of Problem:The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing Factors:A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T/V lift was not performed.The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied.A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber.Additional Observations:The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency.No precursor run through (dry run) of the T/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.)Just prior to the final crane move, the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test.Lessons Learned:GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations.Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation.Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration.Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention.Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them.Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved.The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result.An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use.Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle.Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered.Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded. The video recording of the overturning anomaly and the preceding and following activities was extremely helpful in the investigation and evaluation of this incident. Since mishaps may also occur during normal operations, consideration should be given to video recording all operations involving unique high value equipment. Use of inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras and recorders would permit very economical routine video recording of all activitiesThe TOPEX/POSEIDON overturning incident had the potential for being classified as a NASA Type A Mishap. Only a series of uncontrolled, but fortunate occurrences prevented this from initially being a much more serious anomaly with severe consequences.Major damage to both the spacecraft and the T/V chamber were avoided only because the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted higher than necessary to clear the lip of the chamber. This was done in the erroneous belief that the higher lift (shorter crane to assembly distance) would improve stability by reducing swaying of the load. If the lift had been at the same height as the dry run, the T/V Fixture Assembly might have struck the chamber lip during the rollover resulting in major damage to both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The H-Frame spreader bar was severely damaged, and probably would have failed completely if one of the suspension cables had not snagged on one of the upper SHSS clevis lugs. Complete failure of the spreader bar would have dropped the 8000 pound load approximately equal to 40 feet to the floor of the T/V chamber, destroying both the Spacecraft and the chamber.The Spacecraft fortuitously rolled with the -X side down, where a significant amount of GSE structure was mounted. If the Spacecraft had rotated with the +X side down (or if it had fully inverted) placing it on the floor of the T/V chamber to relieve the loads on the H-Frame spreader bar might not have been possible without significant additional damage to the spacecraft.Following the anomaly only the quick and professional response of the test team and contractor personnel prevented further (and potentially severe) damage to the Spacecraft and chamber facility.",

Stability analysis of lifted assemblies should be done whether or not stability testing is planned. This analysis is essential to determine the need for and the adequacy of any stability testing.Continued Postponement of GSE Review - A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V Fixture Assembly was repeatedly Postponed, and not held prior to use of the Assembly for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber. (In preparation for thermal vacuum testing an Environmental Test Readiness Review was held November 20-21, 1991. There was one page that addressed the entire mechanical GSE in the review documentation. This page was simply a listing of the mechanical GSE and its status.) A supplemental handout available at the November 20, 1991, Environmental Test Readiness Review (ETRR) included an assembly drawing of the lift configuration, but the drawing reproduction did not clearly show the cable attach points. A viewgraph of the lift configuration drawing was not shown at the ETRR. However, it was shown at the previous Monthly Status Review (MSR).Recommendation: Formal mechanical GSE design reviews must be held to assure adequate design evaluation of the proposed lifting configurations. Discussions must include a detailed review of the proposed drawings and procedures for specific attach points, stability analyses, direction of motion, and expected accelerations for all moves.Lack of Designer Experience and Peer Reviews - The Principal Engineer was not familiar with stability analysis of lifting fixtures for loads lifted below the C.G. and did not follow the lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook. Furthermore, no peer review, internal contractor review, or project review of the total T/V Fixture Assembly occurred. The review process failed.Recommendation: Accepted guidelines should be followed in the design of all lifting fixtures. This is especially true when the designer has not designed a lifting fixture before and is unfamiliar with the shortfalls of various lifting fixture configurations. In all cases, a review of the design and margins should be held with peers and supervision to assure the design meets all requirements. A checklist which includes all aspects of the design e.g., stability, loads analysis, proof loading, etc. should be developed.GSE Project reviews should be held and attended by personnel who are capable of assessing the adequacy of the design being reviewed.Lack of Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration (dry run) of the chamber lift activities was not performed prior to the incident. However, a lift of the T/V Fixture Assembly (without the spacecraft) was done earlier for a form fit of the SHSS and thermal shrouds. There were significant, differences in C.G., fixture alignment, and personnel assignments between this lift and the actual spacecraft lift.Recommendation: A high fidelity dry run, using the lifting fixture with the proper mass and C.G. simulator and following the procedures that will be used for the actual lift should be conducted. A formal briefing before the dry run and debriefing after the dry run of the personnel involved should be made for all high value one of a kind spacecraft and equipment.On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Lack of Host Center Review of Hazardous Operations Procedures - The host center (GSFC) did not review the hazardous procedures/operations planned by the outside user organizations. Also the GSFC did not require advance notification of the Center Code 205 or 302 safety organizations of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation.Recommendation: Host center personnel should be required to review all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organization. Host center personnel are much more familiar with the characteristics (and quirks, if any) of their equipment and facilities. Also, they are more likely than the visiting organization to be highly experienced in the type of operations involved. A requirement for formal Host Center \"Buy-Off\" (signature of concurrence) would help ensure proper visibility and attention to hazardous procedures/operations.In addition, the development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered. Advance notification would allow the safety organization the option of monitoring or witnessing selected hazardous activities and ensuring that all internal and external safety requirements are being satisfied.Remaining Spacecraft Handling Operations: At this time the T/V spacecraft handling equipment has been redesigned, tested, analyzed, reviewed and used to move the spacecraft back into the T/V Chamber.Recommendation: The TOPEX Project must examine and approve the stability analysis for all remaining handling configurations, including those at the launch site. A GSE review should be conducted for all remaining handling operations as soon as possible.",

    "abstract": "Support equipment was damaged during a lift because the fixture assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.The lesson provides 7 recommendations involving the need for stability analysis, formal mechanical GSE design reviews, peer review of lifting fixture design, high fidelity dry runs, and involvement of host center personnel.",
    "driving_event": "On Sunday March 8, 1992 the TOPEX/POSEIDON Spacecraft was being prepared for thermal vacuum (T/V) testing by a test team in Building 10 of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As part of the procedure, the T/V Fixture Assembly consisting of the spacecraft, thermal test shrouding and instrumentation mounted on the Spacecraft Horizontal Support Structure (SHSS), suspended by four vertical cables from an H-frame spreader bar was lifted and positioned above the T/V chamber. At approximately 11:25 a.m., during final north / south crane positioning maneuvers, the suspended assembly began a slow overturning rotation. The assembly rotated approximately 135 degrees from horizontal before being halted by the entanglement of one of the four suspension cables with the SHSS. After some bouncing and jostling, it came to rest at approximately 115 degrees.While resting in this anomalous position (+X end up), the Test Team visually determined that the H frame spreader bar assembly had sustained considerable damage during the rotation and might fail. A decision was made by the Spacecraft Manager to remove the vertical load from the overstressed and damaged H frame spreader assembly as quickly as possible by lowering the spacecraft and test fixture to the chamber floor. Within ten minutes of the overturning incident the Test Team, augmented by personnel from a GSFC contractor, lowered the rotated assembly to the chamber floor where it was temporarily secured. During the subsequent visual inspection of the secured assembly it was noted that sections of the thermal test shroud and support fixturing had partially yielded. However, no apparent damage to the spacecraft or to the lower frame of the SHSS could be seen.An on site \"failure review board\" of civil servant and contractor personnel was convened to review and discuss the situation. A decision was made by the board that the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly should be removed and reoriented to a horizontal position outside of the chamber to minimize any further yielding of the supporting structures. A rigging crew was on the scene at this time, and was given the go ahead by the board to proceed with the removal of the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly from the chamber.The damaged H-frame spreader bar and the four suspension cables were removed. A pair of nylon slings were attached from the +X end of the SHSS to the crane hook and the Spacecraft/Thermal Shroud/SHSS assembly was raised vertically out of the T/V chamber and moved directly adjacent to it. The assembly remained there suspended a few inches above the floor while the team attached additional slings from the -X end of the SHSS to a forklift positioned on the -Z side of the load. By alternating operations of the crane and the forklift, the spacecraft and fixture were reoriented horizontally and lowered to the floor. At approximately 6:51 p.m. the operation was completed with the Spacecraft/SHSS assembly safely on the floor in the normal attitude. A video recording of both the anomaly and the recovery operation was made and is available from the TOPEX Project office for viewing.",
    "lessons_learned": "Root Cause of Problem:The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the thermal vacuum chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing Factors:A stability analysis of the total lifted assembly that was used in the T/V lift was not performed.The lifting fixture guidelines contained in JPL900-501, Ground Handling Equipment Design Notebook were not adequately applied.A GSE Review which would have included a review of the T/V handling fixture assembly, was repeatedly postponed, and not held prior to its use for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber.Additional Observations:The overall review process, at all levels (peer review to formal review) failed to identify the lifting fixture deficiency.No precursor run through (dry run) of the T/V lifting exercise, using either the actual or a high fidelity simulation of the lifted assembly, was run prior to the lift with the flight spacecraft. There was a low fidelity dry run with the TOPEX/POSEIDON handling fixture, but it was performed without a spacecraft mass simulation and at different locations and orientations than the flight spacecraft handling. (The stated purpose for the dry run was to check the SHSS and thermal shroud interfaces and clearances to the T/V chamber, not to dry run the actual spacecraft lift.)Just prior to the final crane move, the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted by the crane and a \"rocking test\" was performed on the assembly by the test team to assess its stability. The T/V Fixture Assembly appeared to be stable at that time because the lifting clevis friction was not exceeded during the rocking test.Lessons Learned:GSE Review - Ground support handling equipment should always be reviewed/approved by experienced designers and handling personnel prior to handling operations.Review material - Released drawings, analysis, and procedures for handling equipment should be available for review at least 60 days before a test to permit adequate evaluation.Lifting Equipment Stability Analysis - No lifting equipment should ever be used without a complete stability analysis of the equipment with the load in its complete configuration.Precursor Handling Experience - On protoflight spacecraft, the only precursor handling experience is with a dry run and mass mockups. The mass mockups handling dynamics, geometries, and sequences used for the dry run should simulate the protoflight spacecraft. Analysis and procedural checks are not always adequate to ensure surprises won't occur.Project overview of contract - Project support from the cognizant JPL (or other NASA Center) divisions should ensure, for the area of overview of their organization, that the contractor is adhering to all applicable requirements. All contractual documents (such as JPL 900-501) relating to potentially hazardous operations should be clearly identified and should receive special attention.Dedicated Briefing - A detailed and dedicated briefing structured to review the wording, text, diagrams, etc. is also a mandatory part of any functional demonstration. This briefing serves to inform the personnel who may not have had the opportunity to read or review the written material or see the diagrams, etc. More importantly it is an opportunity for anyone who does not understand his assignment to have a clarification. If there are any reservations with regard to the technical approach of the upcoming activity this forum is the place to discuss them.Functional Demonstration - A functional demonstration of all critical lifts, handling or maneuvers should be performed just prior to any event involving flight hardware. It may be judged too costly or redundant to a detailed procedure, but the value of such an exercise is particularly worthwhile if a high value item such as a one of a kind spacecraft is involved.The actual demonstration (dry run), will reveal discrepancies in the written procedure. When the procedure lacks detail, the demonstration affords the opportunity to try out, or practice, different variations to the step-by-step approach. The unwritten or unspoken, yet implied instruction must be practiced and executed by the actual personnel involved. Where coordinated actions are required the exercise will help assure that everyone has the same response and timing to obtain the same end result.An exact physical and mass mock up would be an ideal item to use for the demonstration, but it is rarely a possibility because of resource or other limitations. The importance of the duplication of the center of gravity with a mass mock up is self evident. The interface points or pickup points of the load can usually be replicated or borrowed from the flight article. However, in no case should they be overloaded or mispositioned from the designated lifting pattern. All shackles, rings, slings, chains, and everything in the load line should be assembled from a sketch or a pictorial equivalent in the procedure which identifies each item as to capacity, size or other details. All parts should carry a dated tag stating the level of proof load sustained, and witnessed by the appropriate project official. Loadlines should not be torn down after a proof or demonstration load test to the levels and conditions stated in the procedure. If a partial tear down is required, the exact reassembly must be assured. This is particularly important with multiple joint assemblies using what appears to be identical hardware, but may have different loadings. Clevis pins must never be mixed from assembly to assembly. One final note on the load line drawings. It has been shown on numerous occasions that the facility does not fit the load line or vice versa even though everyone's opinion was to the contrary. It is prudent to include key dimensions on the load line sketch for later use.Tilt Angle Requirements - Although it did not contribute to the TOPEX overturning incident, the yielding of the spreader bar at a tilt angle of only 8 degrees to 10 degrees raises an important point. Historically, there has been no design requirement for lifting equipment to tolerate a specified tilt angle. Lifting equipment requirements should be revised so the usual safety factors must be met at a specified, tilt angle.Host Center Review of Hazardous Procedures - Host center personnel should perform a review of all hazardous procedures/operations planned by outside user organizations. In addition, development of requirements for advance notification of the host center safety organization of the expected date and time of the actual performance of each hazardous operation should be considered.Video Recording of Hazardous Operations - All hazardous operations should be video recorded. The video recording of the overturning anomaly and the preceding and following activities was extremely helpful in the investigation and evaluation of this incident. Since mishaps may also occur during normal operations, consideration should be given to video recording all operations involving unique high value equipment. Use of inexpensive, off-the-shelf video cameras and recorders would permit very economical routine video recording of all activitiesThe TOPEX/POSEIDON overturning incident had the potential for being classified as a NASA Type A Mishap. Only a series of uncontrolled, but fortunate occurrences prevented this from initially being a much more serious anomaly with severe consequences.Major damage to both the spacecraft and the T/V chamber were avoided only because the T/V Fixture Assembly was lifted higher than necessary to clear the lip of the chamber. This was done in the erroneous belief that the higher lift (shorter crane to assembly distance) would improve stability by reducing swaying of the load. If the lift had been at the same height as the dry run, the T/V Fixture Assembly might have struck the chamber lip during the rollover resulting in major damage to both the Spacecraft and the chamber. The H-Frame spreader bar was severely damaged, and probably would have failed completely if one of the suspension cables had not snagged on one of the upper SHSS clevis lugs. Complete failure of the spreader bar would have dropped the 8000 pound load approximately equal to 40 feet to the floor of the T/V chamber, destroying both the Spacecraft and the chamber.The Spacecraft fortuitously rolled with the -X side down, where a significant amount of GSE structure was mounted. If the Spacecraft had rotated with the +X side down (or if it had fully inverted) placing it on the floor of the T/V chamber to relieve the loads on the H-Frame spreader bar might not have been possible without significant additional damage to the spacecraft.Following the anomaly only the quick and professional response of the test team and contractor personnel prevented further (and potentially severe) damage to the Spacecraft and chamber facility.",
    "recomendations": "FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONSRoot Cause of Problem.- The T/V Fixture Assembly used for lifting the spacecraft into the T/V chamber was unstable in the TOPEX/POSEIDON configuration.Contributing CausesLack of Stability Analysis - A stability analysis of the total T/V Fixture Assembly (T/V Lift Fixture, Cables, SHSS, Satellite, supporting thermal shrouds, and instrumentation) was not performed, reviewed, or approved prior to the overturning incident.Recommendation: A Stability analysis must be performed on all lifting devices in all lift configurations and must be repeated with each new application assigned. A stability factor of 1.5 or greater should be analytically demonstrated to cover possible differences between analysis and the actual lifted assembly. The stability analysis should be treated as a formal mandatory item in the same manner that stress analysis is addressed.Inadequate Stability Testing - Stability testing was done during the proof loading tests of the lifting fixture, and again with the complete T/V Fixture Assembly. Because the impact of clevis friction was not taken into account, neither of these tests revealed the underlying instability. The two \"rocking\" tests were not analyzed for their adequacy in determining fixture instability.Recommendation: Detailed review of all elements of planned testing must be done to assure the testing will accomplish the goals of the test.

    "driving_event": "During functional test of the Qualification Model of the Mobile Transporter (MT) Linear Drive Unit (LDU), mounted on the Functional Test Fixture (FTF) a power surge followed by a facility power outage occurred. A sequence of events began that resulted in two incidents.Incident #1: When power was restored, the Special Test Equipment (STE) console and data acquisition systems (computers) were restarted. For the STE, the operator selected the appropriate program to power up the fixture motors to warm them up, in preparation for the start of the Fixture Characterization Procedure.

    "abstract": "None",
    "driving_event": "At approximately 4 p.m. on June 7, 1996, a liquid oxygen fire occurred in the \"A\" Leg of the LOX feed system for the 750k lb. position of Test Stand 116 located in the East Test Area of MSFC. The fire occurred as the \"A\" Leg engine shutoff valve reached the \"20T open\" position while closing after completion of the fourth of a series of six planned set point tests. These test were being conducted to provide data for establishing the correct throttle valve setting for subsequent planned hot fire testing of a 650k lb. Thrust Chamber Assembly provided by Rocketdyne. At the time of ignition, the \"A\" Leg shutoff valve had closed far enough to permit it to take control of the LOX flow from the venturi. The LOX fire started in the seat region of the valve, progressed from the engine shutoff valve outlet to the test article within 120 ms, and burned for approximately 25 seconds. For the first 8 seconds, the fire was fed by high pressure LOX. The fire partially consumed the lower part of the engine shutoff valve body, the two elbows and straight pipe section that connected the engine shutoff valve and the test article. The test article, all instrumentation devices, hydraulic fluid lines, control wires and cables on the stand were destroyed. The hydraulic fluid fire primarily charred pipe insulation and coated the test stand and its equipment with soot.",

In addition, improvements in other processes are also pointed out.

The board, in most cases, related the lessons learned to their findings and recommendations where applicable, however, they did not feel constrained by them. The lessons learned are as follows:All components proposed for use in high pressure systems should have demonstrated functionally in an application and environments comparable to their intended use. If the above is not feasible, the component design drawing should be fully assessed or the system should be tested under appropriate conditions in an inert environment and disassembled and inspected prior to use in oxygen environments.Chairpersons of Design Reviews, ORIs, etc., should make sure that review documentation accurately reflects the hardware under review.Prospective suppliers should be required to provide historical data to verify their qualification to supply components for the specified environment and intended use.Performance Specifications for purchases of high pressure components must include requirements for demonstrated capability in the media and environment in which the component is to be used.Extreme caution should be exercised when a significant discrepancy exists between expected and actual test data. Testing should not proceed until the discrepancy has been explained to the satisfaction of appropriate discipline experts, and the test team deems it acceptable to proceed.",

Exposure to the NTO oxidizer for 28 days caused substantial corrosion of the ball, and a surface roughness corresponding to a 42% increase in surface area. Another regulator design was therefore installed on Cassini; use of the original design would have caused serious pressurant leakage and possible system contamination problems.Flow Restrictor Braze Material: The pressure sensing ports in the pressure regulators contain flow restrictors which allow the regulator to sense and respond to downstream pressure changes. During the Cassini and MGS regulator heritage reviews, it was discovered that the MO restrictors contained a copper-bearing (AMS-4774) braze and a wax lubricant, neither of which are compatible with NTO propellant vapor. Neither of these materials were listed on the materials list for the regulator. Long term exposure to this vapor could potentially produce enough corrosion products to plug the restrictor orifice, which would likely lead to an inability to sense the downstream pressure and failure to regulate tank pressure. Such extensive exposure of the same regulator to propellant vapors would not normally occur on an Earth-orbital mission where pressurization is only required for a short period immediately following launch. These materials were eliminated in the MGS and Cassini regulator design.One of the credible hypotheses which had earlier been posed for the loss of the MO spacecraft was the plugging of identical flow restrictors due to long term reactions of propellant vapors with an unspecified incompatible material.Teflon Swelling: When the Galileo spacecraft executed 3 large delta V maneuvers with the main 400 Newton engine, restricted helium flow through the check valves caused significant pressure drops in the propellant tanks.

    "driving_event": "Incompatible materials in propulsion systems have posed a major risk to recent missions:Tungsten Carbide Ball Material: During JPL qualification test of the original candidate Cassini pressure regulator, the tungsten carbide/nickel regulator ball was tested for compatibility with nitrogen tetroxide (NTO) and monomethyl hydrazine (MMH). Exposure to the NTO oxidizer for 28 days caused substantial corrosion of the ball, and a surface roughness corresponding to a 42% increase in surface area. Another regulator design was therefore installed on Cassini; use of the original design would have caused serious pressurant leakage and possible system contamination problems.Flow Restrictor Braze Material: The pressure sensing ports in the pressure regulators contain flow restrictors which allow the regulator to sense and respond to downstream pressure changes. During the Cassini and MGS regulator heritage reviews, it was discovered that the MO restrictors contained a copper-bearing (AMS-4774) braze and a wax lubricant, neither of which are compatible with NTO propellant vapor. Neither of these materials were listed on the materials list for the regulator. Long term exposure to this vapor could potentially produce enough corrosion products to plug the restrictor orifice, which would likely lead to an inability to sense the downstream pressure and failure to regulate tank pressure. Such extensive exposure of the same regulator to propellant vapors would not normally occur on an Earth-orbital mission where pressurization is only required for a short period immediately following launch. These materials were eliminated in the MGS and Cassini regulator design.One of the credible hypotheses which had earlier been posed for the loss of the MO spacecraft was the plugging of identical flow restrictors due to long term reactions of propellant vapors with an unspecified incompatible material.Teflon Swelling: When the Galileo spacecraft executed 3 large delta V maneuvers with the main 400 Newton engine, restricted helium flow through the check valves caused significant pressure drops in the propellant tanks. The pressurization system is designed to hold the tank pressures constant during propellant flow. Pressure regulator performance was found to be nominal, but the flight propellant tank pressure data indicated significant degradation of both the fuel and oxidizer check valves.

Subsequent examination of test data from the previous flight engine acceptance tests revealed that the \"hot start\" phenomena had also been present in those tests. JPL did not witness, or request detailed data from, these earlier tests.The \"hot start\" phenomena was eliminated by moving the engine trim orifices downstream of the engine valve and changing the flight operating mode of the thrusters.

The overall benefit are the validation of technology, improved system performance, high system reliability, and mission safety.Implementation Method:Experience in the planning and conduct of propulsion technology tests using the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) has resulted in a systematic and methodical procedure for planning, testing, data analysis, and reporting the results of test bed activities. As seen in Table 1, the testing has ranged from evaluation of new engine components and features, to advanced diagnostic and sensor techniques, to the development of systems for anomaly and failure detection. A key to the continued success of this program has been a technology integration process that places emphasis on integration requirements and costs at an early point in the process. Figure 1 is a flow diagram that depicts the technology integration process. Once an engine technology item has proceeded through the concept evaluation process to a point where a decision is made to pursue test bed evaluation, it is presented by the principal investigator to the Test Bed project manager for prescreening review and then a technology item screening review.[D]Table 1. Typical Types of Technology Test Bed Testing[D]Fig. 1. Technology Test Bed Technology Integration ProcessIn the screening review, an engine technology candidate is judged by its technical merit and potential benefit, the risk of testing the item on the Technology Test Bed engine, and the cost of integrating the item into the engine or facility. Key milestones in the process are Technology Item Screening, the Technology Item Final Design Review, the Integration Design Review, and Hot Fire Testing.Technology Item Final Design Review:Once the technology item is accepted as an output of Technology Item Screening, technology item development proceeds with the conduct of analytical studies, component testing, and the incorporation of design revisions, if required. Then a Technology Item Final Design Review is conducted in which four subject areas are presented and discussed: (1) Technology Item Design Description; (2) Technology Item Design Verification; (3) System Issues; and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The Technology Item Design Description includes the design configuration and characteristics; the design intent or function; the design requirements; materials and processes, drawings and an integrated design configuration. The Technology Item Design Verification consists of the qualification approach, test and verification plans and results, supporting analysis and assurance that the design and performance meets the intent of the requirements. System Issues include system requirements, system compatibility issues, integration plans and issues, constraints, and Technology Test Bed test operational requirements. Safety/Quality Issues include quality assurance provisions such as fabrication processes and controls, traceability, vendor qualification, and nondestructive evaluation techniques; technology item life; risk assessment; hazards analysis; failure modes and effects analysis; risk mitigation; materials certification; and supporting analyses. When the technology item final design review is successfully completed, fabrication can proceed and readiness certified upon acceptance.Technology Item Integration Design Review:The integration review is conducted to verify that the technology item can be accommodated safely and effectively into the TTB. It consists of: (1) an Integration Design Description; (2) Integrated Design Verification; (3) System Issues, and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The subject areas covered in the Technology Item Integration Design Review are similar to those for the Technology Item Final Design Review except that all factors are viewed from the standpoint of interaction of the technology item with the Test Bed and its related subsystems, facilities, instrumentation, software and data.Hot Fire Testing and Results:A test plan is prepared for each test series, and it is reviewed at a pretest readiness review before each test. Instrumentation is configured in accordance with an Instrumentation Program and Command List (IP&CL). A test results review is held after each test and a test report is prepared. When two or more tests are combined into a test series, a test series report is prepared. Examples of these documents are included in the list of References for this practice.Technical Rationale:In the conduct and analysis of over fifty tests conducted in the Technology Test Bed program by MSFC since September 1988, the SSME TTB program has proven to be an indispensable tool in the validation of propulsion technology advances for large liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engines. The program has also yielded numerous advances in measurement and diagnostic methods that are continuing to be used in the TTB program and are applicable to other similar test and evaluation scenarios. The TTB's highly instrumented engine employs over five times the number of measurements used for an acceptance test of a flight engine. This in-depth instrumentation using flow meters, steady state pressure transducers, high frequency pressure measurements, thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, and sophisticated laser and optics techniques has provided an unprecedented amount of detailed knowledge of the performance subtleties of large O2/H2 engines under widely varying conditions. The program has yielded results that have permitted the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology advances without compromising engine reliability.References:\"SSME Improved Characterization Using Highly Instrumented Engine Test Data,\" B.

The overall benefit are the validation of technology, improved system performance, high system reliability, and mission safety.Implementation Method:Experience in the planning and conduct of propulsion technology tests using the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) has resulted in a systematic and methodical procedure for planning, testing, data analysis, and reporting the results of test bed activities. As seen in Table 1, the testing has ranged from evaluation of new engine components and features, to advanced diagnostic and sensor techniques, to the development of systems for anomaly and failure detection. A key to the continued success of this program has been a technology integration process that places emphasis on integration requirements and costs at an early point in the process. Figure 1 is a flow diagram that depicts the technology integration process. Once an engine technology item has proceeded through the concept evaluation process to a point where a decision is made to pursue test bed evaluation, it is presented by the principal investigator to the Test Bed project manager for prescreening review and then a technology item screening review.[D]Table 1. Typical Types of Technology Test Bed Testing[D]Fig. 1. Technology Test Bed Technology Integration ProcessIn the screening review, an engine technology candidate is judged by its technical merit and potential benefit, the risk of testing the item on the Technology Test Bed engine, and the cost of integrating the item into the engine or facility. Key milestones in the process are Technology Item Screening, the Technology Item Final Design Review, the Integration Design Review, and Hot Fire Testing.Technology Item Final Design Review:Once the technology item is accepted as an output of Technology Item Screening, technology item development proceeds with the conduct of analytical studies, component testing, and the incorporation of design revisions, if required. Then a Technology Item Final Design Review is conducted in which four subject areas are presented and discussed: (1) Technology Item Design Description; (2) Technology Item Design Verification; (3) System Issues; and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The Technology Item Design Description includes the design configuration and characteristics; the design intent or function; the design requirements; materials and processes, drawings and an integrated design configuration. The Technology Item Design Verification consists of the qualification approach, test and verification plans and results, supporting analysis and assurance that the design and performance meets the intent of the requirements. System Issues include system requirements, system compatibility issues, integration plans and issues, constraints, and Technology Test Bed test operational requirements. Safety/Quality Issues include quality assurance provisions such as fabrication processes and controls, traceability, vendor qualification, and nondestructive evaluation techniques; technology item life; risk assessment; hazards analysis; failure modes and effects analysis; risk mitigation; materials certification; and supporting analyses. When the technology item final design review is successfully completed, fabrication can proceed and readiness certified upon acceptance.Technology Item Integration Design Review:The integration review is conducted to verify that the technology item can be accommodated safely and effectively into the TTB. It consists of: (1) an Integration Design Description; (2) Integrated Design Verification; (3) System Issues, and (4) Safety/Quality Issues. The subject areas covered in the Technology Item Integration Design Review are similar to those for the Technology Item Final Design Review except that all factors are viewed from the standpoint of interaction of the technology item with the Test Bed and its related subsystems, facilities, instrumentation, software and data.Hot Fire Testing and Results:A test plan is prepared for each test series, and it is reviewed at a pretest readiness review before each test. Instrumentation is configured in accordance with an Instrumentation Program and Command List (IP&CL). A test results review is held after each test and a test report is prepared. When two or more tests are combined into a test series, a test series report is prepared. Examples of these documents are included in the list of References for this practice.Technical Rationale:In the conduct and analysis of over fifty tests conducted in the Technology Test Bed program by MSFC since September 1988, the SSME TTB program has proven to be an indispensable tool in the validation of propulsion technology advances for large liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen rocket engines. The program has also yielded numerous advances in measurement and diagnostic methods that are continuing to be used in the TTB program and are applicable to other similar test and evaluation scenarios. The TTB's highly instrumented engine employs over five times the number of measurements used for an acceptance test of a flight engine. This in-depth instrumentation using flow meters, steady state pressure transducers, high frequency pressure measurements, thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, and sophisticated laser and optics techniques has provided an unprecedented amount of detailed knowledge of the performance subtleties of large O2/H2 engines under widely varying conditions. The program has yielded results that have permitted the incorporation of state-of-the-art technology advances without compromising engine reliability.References:\"SSME Improved Characterization Using Highly Instrumented Engine Test Data,\" B.
