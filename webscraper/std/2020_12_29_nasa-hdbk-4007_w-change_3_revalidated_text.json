SPACECRAFT HIGH-VOLTAGE PASCHEN  AND CORONA DESIGN HANDBOOK  his NASA Technical Handbook presents an overview of the current understanding of the  electrical design techniques that can mitigate deleterious effects (such as Paschen and corona  discharges) resulting from operation of a high-voltage system in space, references common  design practices that have been successful in mitigating these effects in the past, and  recommends standard practices to eliminate or mitigate such effects in the future.   he purpose of this NASA Technical Handbook is to present an overview of high-voltage  electrical/electronic design techniques required to specify and apply electrical insulation to  spacecraft high-voltage parts, components, and systems. Of particular interest are spacecraft  system designs that are needed to meet stringent fault-free operation for a period of days to years  in space without maintenance. The first objective is to develop an understanding of electrical  insulation characteristics and the influence of aging. A second objective is to capture decades of  lessons learned and present recommended design, analysis, and test methodologies that have  been applied to the many successful space vehicle electronic programs during their development,  manufacture, final assembly, test, and flight.   his NASA Technical Handbook is applicable to all high-voltage power systems that operate in  space. It is not intended to replace the following low Earth orbit or geosynchronous Earth orbit  spacecraft charging standards or handbooks: NASA-STD-4005, Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft  Charging Design Standard; NASA-HDBK-4006, Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Charging Design  Handbook; ISO-11221, Space Systems\u2013Space Solar Panels\u2013Spacecraft Charging Induced  Electrostatic Discharge Test Methods; and NASA HDBK 4002A, Mitigating In-Space Charging  Effects\u2014A Guideline. Rather, this NASA Technical Handbook is to complement them to  provide for better interior spacecraft high-voltage designs that would prevent Paschen and/or  corona discharges, not to deal with plasma interactions that are the purview of other documents.

The resistivity is therefore the quotient of the potential gradient, in V/m,  and the current per unit of electrode length, A/m. Since the four ends of the electrodes define a  square, the lengths in the quotient cancel and surface resistivities are most accurately reported in  ohms, although it is common to see the more descriptive unit of ohms per square.

The trend is toward more advanced systems operating at higher  voltages in compact, economical packages that have been submitted to a battery of controls to  ensure a high-quality assembly. If materials are to be operated under much more demanding  specifications, better information is required on the limits of these materials and on their design  and manufacturing techniques.  lthough section 3.2 gives definitions of many terms used in this NASA Technical Handbook,  for better clarification, it is important to provide additional explanation for the following major  terms:    above which electrical breakdown phenomena are likely to occur. The absolute voltage for a  breakdown event, however, is dependent upon the electrical parameters (frequency and  magnitude) and structural, geometric, and environmental constraints. Breakdown voltages can  range from tens of volts in microwave systems to thousands of volts in utility systems.  . \u201cElectrical insulation\u201d is a generic term given to vacuum, or to gaseous, liquid, and  solid materials exhibiting high electric resistivity that may be used to electrically isolate two or  more conducting surfaces.                    as internal discharges in the cavities within the solid dielectric, surface discharges along the  surface of insulator, and corona discharges around a sharp edge (usually around the electrode  surface). Usually, the magnitude of such discharges is small; however, they may cause  progressive deterioration of the insulation and lead to ultimate failure.  . \u201cPure air\u201d: The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its  components (e.g. CH4, CO2, H2O) so 'pure' air has no precise meaning. The composition of the  major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084;  oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane,  0.00016; krypton, 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087. The  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons and some  other species of anthropogenic origin are increasing measurably with time. For purposes of this  document, \u201cpure air\u201d is assumed to consist of such a mixture that is free of any contaminant that  could possibly alter its electrical or dielectric behavior.  For early spacecraft missions, techniques were developed for the detection of partial discharges  in spacecraft electronic equipment. Use of these techniques clearly showed that the reduction of  partial discharges enhanced equipment life, and thereafter testing incorporating such techniques  made mandatory to eliminate faulty insulation and flawed workmanship. Some examples of  representative instrumentation and test techniques, both of which have matured and improved  over time, are described later in this NASA Technical Handbook.  n the modern spacecraft electronics industry, dense packaging is required to make the  equipment fit within a restricted volume. Likewise, weight is restricted to economize on fuel and  maximize space for the payload. Consequently, high electrical field stresses, which enhance  partial discharge activity, are often present. Such partial discharge activities can be a contributing  factor in insulation degradation.  insulation degradation, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and the upset of poorly protected  sensitive circuits without proper shielding or noise suppression. Insulated conductors may be  highly susceptible to continuous corona or partial discharges when operated at very low pressure  gaseous environments, because the corona, or breakdown initiation voltage, is a function of both  the density and content of the gaseous environment. For example, helium has a much lower  breakdown voltage at low pressures than air or nitrogen. The insulated and non-insulated  conductors, terminations, and other electrical/electronic parts may be susceptible to this  phenomenon in the high field stresses caused by the dense population of parts within the system  design. Some insulation systems, however, can endure partial discharge or corona activities for  microseconds to milliseconds, for thousands of repetitive occurrences, as experienced with pulse  power applications.            lectrical and electronic equipment used in space applications should be designed to operate  over a range of pressures and temperatures from sea level conditions to the space environment.  Most terrestrial low-voltage equipment can be designed to meet the sea-level requirement by  using conformal coatings on all parts and boards and by using properly spaced parts and circuits.  However, at low-pressure or vacuum conditions, these techniques may not be applicable. Hence,  spacecraft equipment designs should consider rarefied gas or air as an essential packaging design  criterion. Lightweight, small volume packaging dictates that circuitry operating in rarefied air  may require special consideration, such as pressurization or encapsulation. Gas-filled packages  require conformal coatings to prevent corrosion, voltage breakdown, and flashover between  closely spaced electrodes when operated at higher voltages. Furthermore, many equipment  failures are caused by corroding circuitry related to exposure to wide temperature ranges, humid  environments (manned spacecraft), contamination (collection and deposition of debris, oils, and  dirt), or a very dry, hot environment (unmanned spacecraft) while operating. Additionally,  delamination of insulating materials has also caused problems. When designing high-voltage  systems for space applications, these issues also should be addressed.  continuing process for applications in manned and unmanned spacecraft. The initial studies and  test evaluations began following World War II and continue for modern aerospace equipment.  All of the testing techniques and procedures for the data presented herein were initiated in the  early 1950s and should continue well into the 21st century.    ome of the better insulation compositions containing asbestos were deleted from use in space  programs in the 1960s but may be reinstated for very special applications in the future. Although  mica is a material with excellent electrical, temperature, and chemical characteristics, it is  difficult to apply to long, thin conductors at present; therefore, most electrical insulating  materials consist of organic, inorganic, and glass fiber composite insulation systems. Among  these, most organic composite materials have an upper long-life temperature limit of less than  260 \u00b0C. While this temperature range is adequate for some space applications (e.g. avionics), for  many others their use may be limited. The electrical and electronics industries have been making  concerted efforts to reduce the weight and size of parts in their various systems, as time and  technology progress. Along with this, the insulation on flat and round conductors has been  reduced to a minimum that can provide the necessary mechanical, chemical, thermal, and  electrical characteristics.   a high-voltage system in space would be a challenging task and systems insulation should have  life similar to the spacecraft itself. The true rating for an insulation system is the voltage at which  the insulation life becomes infinite on a voltage-time curve as determined experimentally. If an  excessively high voltage is applied to the insulation system repeatedly, the life will be shortened.  There is a much lower voltage at which the life becomes infinite. This is the voltage at which the  curve becomes asymptotic to the lifetime axis. In some insulation systems, it is often noted that             the rated voltage, as determined by the lifetime curve, is also the corona inception (or initiation)  voltage (CIV). System operation above the CIV seriously degrades the insulation life. This  implies that to ensure maximum life, there must be no corona or partial discharges in the system.   important secondary factors related to corona and transients include radiated and conducted EMI,  production of ozone and other noxious gases, and power loss associated with the partial  discharge energy. This implies that a calculation of the corona inception voltage for a given  insulation system is a logical approach in determining a maximum voltage rating for a given  system.  bridging the electrodes is termed partial discharge. Potential sites of such discharges are voids or  gaseous inclusions in the bulk of solid insulation or in bubbles in liquid dielectric material (e.g.  transformer oil), which could be distributed randomly either because of natural defects or by way  of manufacturing. A partial discharge is the breakdown of such a void between two surfaces with  a voltage difference between them.    hen an electric field is applied in a gas-filled region, no current flows, apart from capacitive  current, unless there are free electric charges present. When the applied electric field strength is  low, the current flow is usually related to external sources and is not sufficient to cause any  partial discharges. However, at higher applied electric field strengths, the free charged particles  can gain energies from the field, resulting in ionization of the gaseous species by elastic or  inelastic collisions. In gaseous environments and uniform fields, buildup of charge leads to an  unstable situation, in which the current increases very rapidly while the applied voltage  collapses. This usually results in a discharge bridging the electrode gap. However, in a highly  non-uniform field, the charges can form a kind of electrostatic shield around the electrode where  the electric field strength is greater and, therefore, causes quenching of the self-sustained  discharge. The resulting discharge does not bridge the gap and usually is called the corona  discharge. Further, this discharge may be either pulsating or continuous, and the average current  may be relatively low (in the milliampere range).  n practice, the term \u201ccorona\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term \u201cpartial discharge.\u201d  However, corona is local ionization of a gaseous medium caused by a high electric field stress  around a point or wire, whereas partial discharge occurs in a void or bubble in the dielectric  material or insulation.                      of the dielectric material but on the stress in the cavity (shape dependent) and the breakdown  strength of the cavity (type of the gas species; density dependent). Since cavity shape and  characteristics of the gas inside it cannot be predicted precisely, the partial discharge initiation  voltage predictions are relatively more difficult than corona initiation predictions.  vessels, effectively isolating the system from the external environment. In this case, the  environment is part of the system design and accounts for high voltages present. Pressurization is  often considered impractical because it requires heavy, tight enclosures with special high-quality  seals. Nevertheless, when this approach is taken, one can assume that significant high-voltage  interactions will not occur; therefore, this case is not considered further in this NASA Technical  Handbook.   n general, a spacecraft\u2019s interaction with its environment is of paramount concern for spacecraft  design and operation. High-voltage systems require special precautions because of the  ever-present possibility of gas discharge phenomena. The following are outlined in this section:      he dominant environment between 100 and 1000 km altitude is the neutral atmosphere. In this  essentially collisionless regime, the gases are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Below about 100 km,  where the atmosphere is homogeneous, the composition is approximately 80 percent nitrogen  (N2) and 18 percent oxygen (O2) with traces of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), argon (Ar), and other  gases. Above 100 km, atomic oxygen, which is made from the photo dissociation of molecular                            oxygen (O2), comes to dominate. Above about 800 km, the atmosphere is largely atomic  hydrogen (H). At a 500-km altitude, the number density of neutral species varies from 2\uf0b4106 to  3\uf0b4108 cm-3, depending on the level of solar activity and position in the orbit. The kinetic  temperature of the gas is usually between 500 and 2000 K, and the ambient pressure is in the  range of 10-10 to 5\uf0b410-8 Torr.   in situ neutral composition and satellite drag measurements have evolved over the years into  reliable predictors of the average composition and thermal structure of the thermosphere. The  most notable of these models are the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (MSIS) model  (Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)) based on in situ satellite observations of neutral  concentrations, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) version of the Jacchia model derived  from satellite drag measurements, and the United States (U.S.) Standard Atmosphere (National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)). These models provide good estimates of the  thermosphere environment as functions of altitude, longitude, latitude, local time, magnetic  activity, and solar activity and are continually updated as new information becomes available. Of  particular interest is AIAA standard Guide to Reference and Standard Atmosphere Models,  which provides guidelines for selected reference and standard atmospheric models including  consideration of their content, uncertainties, and limitations.   spacecraft never operates in a clean environment. The environment in which a spacecraft  operates is a combination of the ambient and various gaseous components originating from  outgassing and other contamination sources from the vehicle itself. Outgassing from the  spacecraft structure and its subsystems begins to rapidly increase from the moment of launch,  while the ambient pressure quickly decreases from sea-level atmospheric pressure (760 Torr) to  that of orbit ambient pressure (less than 10-6 Torr). This external pressure change takes only a  few minutes, whereas the pressure next to the spacecraft surface and the spacecraft interior  pressure will remain at a higher pressure throughout the life of the spacecraft, because of the  outgassing of electrical, structural, and purging systems aboard the spacecraft.     of dry air at a pressure of 10-6 Torr is greater than 5\uf0b4105 V/cm, a value 16 times the dielectric  strength of air at sea level. This is because there are few charge carriers, and the mean free path  of electrons exceeds the gap length between closely spaced electrodes. For internal volumes of a  spacecraft and even for external adjacent spaces, such vacuum conditions are seldom achieved.  The designer should assume, therefore, that the environment is characterized by a low-pressure  gaseous environment.  n a typical case, a system can be described as a vented enclosure within which sources of gas  production will reach equilibrium with venting. Sources include the following:                  t has been observed in the past that these sources are capable of maintaining a spacecraft  pressure of about 0.01 Torr for several minutes to hours even though the external pressure is less  than 10-6 Torr. Figure 1, Spacecraft Internal Pressure, shows data for a particular spacecraft  (Sutton and Stern, 1975).   uring the boost phase, most of the gas escapes rapidly from the spacecraft interior for the first  30 km into space, while continuum flow exists. During this interval, the interior pressure of the  spacecraft is nearly the same as the external pressure. As the spacecraft continues on its projected  course, its internal pressure will be greater than the external pressure. This is because of slow  outgassing and venting through small orifices, tubes, and cracks for gases entrapped in electrical  and thermal insulation and structural materials.   here are several ways to calculate the internal gas pressure and flow rates through the openings,  cracks, or orifices for a spacecraft. Depending on the gas density, these calculations can be in the  and voltage breakdown at low gas pressures. Enclosed electronic equipment with restricted  venting, which delays outgassing, may be a cause of faults within high-voltage equipment.            molecular flow region, viscous flow region, or transition region (Dushman and Lafferty, 1965).  For a spacecraft with small amounts of outgassing products and operating in a low-pressure  environment, the flow can be characterized as molecular flow because the mean free path of the  molecules is much larger than the dimensions of the orifice or the openings. Then, the gas flow  can be calculated by the Clausing equation (Dushman and Lafferty, 1965).   1/2  )    C is the flow conductance of the orifices in cm3/s  A is the total area of the orifices in cm2  T is the internal temperature in K  M is the molecular weight of the gas in g/mole  K is a dimensionless function of orifice (tube) length over diameter and is tabulated in (Dushman  and Lafferty, 1965).    nd accounts for the Botzmann constant, the conversion from mass to molecular weight, and  absorbs several dimensionless integers. This equation can be used for estimating the flow of gas  from chamber to chamber in a multiple chamber vacuum system.  rates. He showed that the depressurization time constant \uf074 is V/C, where \uf074 is the time for the  pressure to decrease to 36 percent of its initial pressure, V is the volume in cubic centimeters, and  C is the flow conductance for the orifices in cubic centimeters per second, given by        1/2  )       Ak is the area of the k orifices in square centimeters  m = mass of the gas molecule in grams  k is the Boltzmann constant  Air and nitrogen have a time constant of approximately 0.4 s when bled through a 1-cm2 opening  in a steel sphere (Scialdone, 1969). NASA experience (Sutton and Stern, 1975) has shown that a  0.1 time constant ensures adequate outgassing around high-voltage circuits.                   electrically insulated parts, semi-shielded boxes, and boxes within modules. In addition,  compressed gases for orbit adjustment are carried and released. With these complexities, it is  more appropriate to qualify the design by testing the completely assembled spacecraft. This can  be done in a thermal vacuum chamber to measure the real internal and external spacecraft  pressures and the outgassing rate, instead of relying on calculated outgassing values for the  system integrity.    should be taken, because the outgassing rates for multilayer insulation are different from the  outgassing (or venting) through orifices. This can be seen in an experiment performed using 100  layers of super insulation across the center of a vacuum chamber. The chamber was pumped only  from the side labeled Volume A in figure 2, Effects of Thermal Insulation on Outgassing Rate  (Dunbar, 1988), while Volume B was isolated by the layered insulation. During the initial  pumpdown, gas exhibited bulk flow through interstitial spaces in the insulation. As a result,  during the first 15 min of pumpdown, the pressure in the chamber dropped from sea-level  pressure to 0.1 Torr, with the gauge on the thermally insulated side of the chamber following  pump pressure within 5 percent. As the pump pressure dropped further, entering the high vacuum  regime, the pressure on the insulated side of the chamber decreased very slowly as gas was  released into the chamber by purging and outgassing from the many layers of insulation. This  experiment shows clearly that designers who specify such insulation to control radiative transfer  need to be aware of the lengthy time required to eliminate both trapped and adsorbed gas. Should  high voltage be present in the affected part of the system, such gas might pose a breakdown  threat during the purging process.            n the Apollo telescope mount of the Skylab spacecraft, the area of the outgassing ports was  approximately 1 sq. cm per liter volume, the value recommended for adequate spacecraft  outgassing for high-voltage experiments and equipment onboard Skylab. The resulting pressures  are summarized in figure 3, Gas Pressure Inside the Apollo Telescope Mount (Dunbar, 1973).  The Apollo telescope mount volume included several hundred feet of Teflon\u00ae-insulated  instrumentation and low power wiring, plus the telescopes and ancillary electronic equipment.  Wiring requires significant time for purging since the entrapped gas has to travel up to half the  length of the wire to escape from each end. Clamping can further restrict the gas flow within the  electrical strands.              he Skylab space vehicle had several separate modules, including the airlock module (AM),  multiple-docking adapter (MDA), and the payload shroud/fixed airlock shroud/instrument unit  (PS/FAS/IU). During launch, the vent valves were purposely left open to allow modules to  outgas freely. The module internal pressure was allowed to outgas to a minimum pressure of  25 Torr. At that time, the multiple docking adapter vent was closed; the remaining vent valves  remained open as shown in figure 3. As the Skylab proceeded toward space, at time 600 s after  lift-off, the external (space) pressure was 1.07\uf0b410-8 Torr, but the internal pressures remained  above 10-3 Torr for 20 min. The module internal pressure as a function of time is shown in figure  4, Pressure in Airlock Module Truss Compartment. The sublimator pressure pulses shown in  figure 4 had a flow rate of 0.01156 lbm/s for 300 s per pulse.              oams can be used in electrical and electronic equipment as dielectric material or supporting  (cushioning) material. These foams are very porous, however, and contain large volumes of  captured gas. Since outgassing is very slow and becomes a constant contamination source in  vacuum, use of these foam materials should be avoided in high-voltage systems. The equation to  calculate the diffusion coefficient (D) for a foam can be found in work by Cuddihy and  Moacanin (1965) when needed. They also found that the calculated values for outgassing rates in  polyurethane foam used for electrical/electronic insulation were within a factor of 2 of  experimentally measured values (Cuddihy and Moacanin, 1965). Furthermore, Scannapieco  (1970) gives the outgassing rates of spacecraft materials as a function of temperature and effects  of outgassing on voltage breakdown.  show that the spacecraft internal pressure may be significantly greater than the external pressure  for several days after orbital insertion. Furthermore, outgassing products within a high-voltage  module may keep the pressure near the minimum breakdown potential region for safe, reliable  operation of high-voltage circuits, making it advisable to delay their turn on. Likewise, the  outgassing products of the spacecraft and reaction control propellants increase the pressure in the  vicinity of the spacecraft as shown in figure 1.              uborbital spacecraft have all the short-time outgassing problems of orbital spacecraft, except  that the electronics have to operate from Earth\u2019s surface, to apogee, and back to Earth\u2019s surface.  For example, the X-33 experimental spacecraft was designed for a flight profile commencing at  Earth\u2019s surface, progressing to a maximum apogee of 150,000 ft altitude, and returning to Earth.  Maximum external pressure of the vehicle would be as great as 760 Torr at launch (Earth\u2019s sea-  level average pressure). Minimum external airframe pressure would be that of maximum apogee  or less than 0.01 Torr.    Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) spacecraft is reported by Nunz (1990). An example of outgassing is  shown for the BEAR space orbiter electronics compartment in figure 5, Payload Pressure for a  Vented Payload During Launch. The curve designated as region 2 in figure 5 was for an  electronic component facing space with the side of the spacecraft open to space. In 10 min time,  the pressure remained at 0.05 Torr, that is, BEAR had a large outgassing area compared to the  total surface area. The curve designating the diagnostic region, containing wiring and many  components inside a semi-enclosed compartment, is shown to have had pressure greater than  0.5 Torr for the full 10 min flight time. In addition, there were no purge gases supporting the  pressurization of BEAR. Some suborbital vehicles will have purge gases. Based on the BEAR  pressure profile and continuous outgassing, it is estimated that the pressure around all  components and wiring within the confines of the air frame will have pressure greater than  0.1 Torr for a suborbital flight duration. Figure 5 can be found in Nanevicz and Hilbers (1973).                voltage rocket launch (SPEAR 3). The series tested a variety of very high voltage methods for  using the vacuum as an insulator.

Helium has also been used as a purge gas; however, compared to other  gases, it has a very low breakdown voltage when depressurized and exacerbates the corona  problem. When helium gas is chosen as the purge gas, a significant amount of residual helium  will be trapped in the porous insulation, such as fiberglass, and inside some electronic  components and parts, such as transformers and power conversion equipment, during the first  flight. Subsequent flights will commence with a higher helium content in the air-helium gas  mixture. This can result in continual corona inside or between components following initiation  for the duration of the flight.  compartments that escape by laminar gas flow, continuous leakage of hydrogen or helium  through tank walls, nitrogen purges of the electronics bay, and the outgassing of parts and  components.   breakdown voltage similar to that of air, which is higher than the helium breakdown voltage. A  small amount of air mixed with nitrogen (less than 5 percent air) gives the mixture  approximately the same breakdown and corona inception characteristic as that of pure air. It is  impossible, therefore, to completely void the airframe with a single nitrogen purge. From a  voltage breakdown or CIV initiation characteristic, a purge with nitrogen is recommended. The  voltage breakdown characteristics of air, helium, hydrogen, and nitrogen are shown in table 1,  Paschen Law Breakdown Voltages at the Critical Pressure-Spacing Dimension for Select Gases  at dc and 400 Hz.

As an example, it was observed in a sensitive  photomultiplier circuit that a mere increase in temperature from 0 to 15 \u00b0C raised the ambient gas  pressure to the extent that the partial discharge counts increased from 10 to 1000 times normal  (Dunbar, 1973). This is shown in figure 6, Partial Discharge Counts Measured in a Sensitive  Photomultiplier Circuit (Dunbar, 1973), where corona-pulse count increases with temperature.    eglecting these partial discharges is a risk to design. All circuits should be tested at operating  temperatures and pressures with sensitive instruments. When signals from high-voltage circuits  show unexplained or unpredicted noise, especially if the noise is temperature dependent, the  engineer should carefully investigate possible partial discharge activities within the circuitry.  Such partial discharge will initially produce only noise, but in time, the conformal coating may  crack or debond, exposing a bare electrode that would then provide a supply of free electrons,  resulting in system failure.  encapsulated circuits. An example of an improperly bonded surface on a capacitor is shown in  figure 7, Delaminated High-Voltage Capacitors (Dunbar, 1983). Applying high voltage to the  capacitor will ionize the gas in the crack, heating the gas and the insulation surfaces, and further  increasing the outgassing rate. Gas escaping from the cracks alters the pressure-spacing  dimension, generating circuit noise. Continuous partial discharges eventually overheat the  insulation, enlarge cracks, and ultimately can produce voltage breakdown.             illers are sometimes added to an encapsulant to enhance structural strength. For example, if the  filled encapsulant is poured over a coil winding or over the end of a stranded wire, voids will be  created, usually either between windings or between the windings and metal core where partial  discharges can occur. Figure 8, Insulation Deterioration on the Coil Winding, shows the resulting  deteriorated insulation on the coil winding. The figure shows a cut away view of an encapsulated  coil at three different magnifications. The clear region around the coils indicates that the potting  compound merely covered the wires without penetrating the regions between them, creating a  void chamber in which the charged conductors can interact through Paschen discharge. The outer  surface of the insulation is only slightly pervious to the products of internal outgassing and will  allow the internal pressure to rise toward the Paschen minimum for the spacing involved.  Initially, most voids are between 1\uf0b410-3cm (0.4 mil) and 5\uf0b410-2 cm (20 mil). The pressure at the  Paschen minimum for these voids is between 20 and 750 Torr. This pressure can be sustained  with continuous outgassing through infinitesimal outgassing ports.                   development test should be made to prove that the encapsulation process has successfully  precluded voids, cracks, and improperly bonded regions. For transparent encapsulants, it is  recommended that sample discs of the potting material be poured. Cracks, voids, and  delaminations are easily detected through a polarizing lens. Translucent and opaque materials  require either a destructive examination or a very sensitive measurement of partial discharges.  hile the chief concern for the designer is usually the contamination that results in a system-  induced environment, there is another concern that, in many cases, will be more important. It is  generally assumed that circuit and surface potentials present throughout the system at all times  are known in advance because of design. Electromagnetic effects on systems and spacecraft  surfaces can dramatically alter these potentials, leading to achievement of CIV and subsequent  breakdown. In this section, we review electromagnetic effects on systems and spacecraft  surfaces.                  riboelectric charging occurs whenever two dissimilar materials come in contact with each other  and then separate. One material pulls charges (mainly electrons) from the other, leaving the first  one (the one with the excess electrons) with a positive charge and the second with a negative  charge. An example of this occurs when a space vehicle flies through moisture containing ice  crystals. The ice crystals lose electrons to the spacecraft. As a result, the spacecraft ends up with  a large negative potential because of the accumulation of this negative charge (Tanner and  Nanevicz, 1961). As more ice particles impinge upon the surface of the spacecraft, charge will  accumulate until the corona threshold is exceeded. Then, corona may initiate, with the corona  discharge current equaling the charging current. It is a good approximation to regard triboelectric  charging as a constant current source.  composed of dielectric or dielectric-coated sections, in contrast to a metal skin. Charge  accumulated on a dielectric material cannot easily flow away from the point of deposition.  Charge thus accumulates on the surface until the electric field along the surface is large enough  to support a streamer discharge over the dielectric surface to a nearby metal structure. If the  dielectric strength of the insulator is exceeded before the streamer occurs, however, then the  charge may be relieved by a spark discharge that punctures the dielectric and travels to an  underlying conductor. Streamer discharges, like spark discharges, seek the lowest impedance  path to the vehicle structure. During the course of its operational life, a spacecraft may encounter  a number of sources of triboelectric charging. Natural sources include cosmic dust and  micrometeoroids while manmade sources arise from materials spalled by cosmic dust impacts  with spacecraft surfaces, outgassing products, and small particles arising from various orbital  debris interactions.  effects occur with them as with other dielectric materials. Streamer discharges from windshields  and windows are a source of radio frequency (RF) noise (Rupke, 2002).  xhaust from the rocket motors and jet engines may not be considered a detrimental effect.  Before any conclusive measurements on rockets were made, it was assumed that the rocket  engine could have one of three effects on the electrostatic potential of the spacecraft:    ase a.\u2014If the engines were capable of charging the vehicle to the potentials above the vehicle  threshold potential, then corona discharges and EMI would accompany each launch. (This is the  worst-case scenario.)  ase b.\u2014When the conductivity of the exhaust is sufficient to limit the vehicle to some value  below the corona threshold potential, then there will be no corona discharges or associated EMI  related to engine charging. Other charging sources, however, still could cause corona discharge.             Case c.\u2014If the rocket engine exhaust was so effective a discharger that the vehicle would be  held below the corona threshold even when other charging sources were present, then the rocket  engine would tend to alleviate, rather than aggravate, the vehicle charging problem. (This is a  positive effect.)   exhaust is an excellent discharger (Case c) (Nanevicz and Hilbers, 1973). Similarly on Voyager  (and many other spacecraft) it was reported that the rocket exhaust could be \u201cheard\u201d in the VHF  antenna experiment due to a global discharge of the spacecraft when the engines were fired.  Jet engine exhaust, being at a lower temperature, corresponds to the second possibility (Case b).   and rapid rise time related to turbulence are able to produce RF noise over a broad spectrum.  This interference may disable radio receiving systems and, in some cases, may induce spurious  pulses in the electronic systems controlling stage sequencing and vehicle guidance.   ne other place where the effect of vehicle charging can be damaging is where the conducting  sections of the vehicle are not properly connected together. For example, when a rocket vehicle  is charged triboelectrically on the forward surfaces and discharged from the skirt at the aft end  and the forward section is not electrically connected to the aft section, then charge acquired on  the forward section cannot flow to the aft section freely. Thus, the vehicle is differentially  charged, unless the potential difference between the sections becomes large enough for a spark  discharge to occur. This electrical isolation occurs as a result of improper electrical connection at  the interface of two sections. When a spark or arc discharge event takes place between  differentially charged sections, it may be destructive, depending on the magnitude of the  discharge.  hese spark discharges can be quite energetic, since the capacitance between the sections may be  several thousand picofarads and the sparkover voltage may be several kilovolts. Furthermore, the  spark discharges will seek the easiest electrical path between the sections. If there is some  electrical wiring routed across this gap, it is possible that the spark will travel through a shorter  gap from the front section to the wiring and then through another short gap to the aft section.  This, of course, would put a tremendous noise pulse on any data line. Also, there is the  possibility that these spark discharges could fire electro-explosive devices when they are onboard  and in the vicinity of the sparkover site. In the past, electro-explosive devices on rockets have  occasionally been initiated by corona or streamer discharge (Bennett, 1968). The development of  the current NASA Standard Initiator (NSI-2) included prevention of such initiation as a priority  design goal (Roberts Research Laboratory, June 1988). This effort was successful as more than  20 years of experience with this NSI has shown no problems with electrostatic discharge  initiation. For other electro-explosive devices, discharges between unbonded sections especially  present a real danger; therefore, proper connection between sections of the spacecraft is essential.           t had been conjectured that electrostatic discharges could occur between stages as they are  separated. In fact, it was shown that the separation of two dissimilar objects could cause  substantial voltage difference between the bodies (Haffner, 1966). Experiments by Nanevicz and  Vance (1966) have shown, however, that the two parts of the staging vehicle will be electrically  connected through the conductive exhaust plume as long as the motor plume is in contact with  the expended stage. It does not seem conceivable that significant differences in potential, that is,  more than a few tens of volts, can be developed between separating sections during a staging  event in which the upstage motor is ignited at or before the time of stage separation. For launch  vehicle designs where tens of seconds can pass between stage separation and upper stage ignition  (e.g., Saturn 5), engineers must be aware of the electrostatic risk.   t has been found that a high-resistance conductive coating over the dielectric surface is quite  effective in eliminating streamers and the noise they cause. The conductive coating drains away  the charge as rapidly as it arrives and prevents the electrostatic potential buildup, which can  produce streamer discharges. The coatings (Schmitt, 1972) used for nontransparent dielectrics  are usually opaque and have a surface conductivity (the inverse of surface resitivity) on the order  of a 1 M\uf057-1. Most windshields are made of either glass or acrylic plastics. Glass has a lower  surface resistivity (1\uf0b41012 \uf057) than the acrylics (1\uf0b41016 \uf057). This is attributed to the open silica  network in glass that allows hydration. It has been shown that a surface resistivity of 1\uf0b4108 \uf057 is  sufficient to bleed off accumulating charge (Schmitt, 1972).   fused into the glass exterior surface to sufficient depth that erosion should not seriously reduce  the conductivity of the external surface coating during the life of the windshield.    corona-generated noise. In one case involving a loop antenna on an aircraft, it was shown that  correct placement reduced the noise factor by 25 dB (Tanner and Nanevicz, 1961). It was further  shown that at least 25 dB of noise suppression can be obtained with dipole antennas if two of  them are correctly placed and balanced.                               unbar, William G.

In  this section, we will characterize the interactions that result when high-voltage systems are  exposed to these environments. In the following sections, we will review electromagnetic fields  within materials, break-down phenomenon in gaseous and solid media, and cover interactions of  high-voltage systems with a plasma environment typical of Earth orbits.  density, high-power packaging design. For high-voltage equipment, additional emphasis should  be placed on electromagnetic field stress and material selection and application. The following  section gives an overview of electromagnetic field calculations for common geometry in electric  power system construction.    o select and design insulation for electrical equipment properly, it is often essential to make  plots of the field distribution. As technology advances, the structures become more and more  complicated and analytical methods to calculate the electric field lines and potential gradients  become less effective. Therefore, numerical methods are being developed to calculate field lines  and potential gradients. Currently, there are many computer package programs to simulate  electromagnetic fields for a given structure. These programs operate based on either finite-  element or finite-difference techniques. Also researchers have developed in-house computer  programs to meet specific applications.  hese field-plotting techniques are used to determine the maximum stress value in the  configuration for both operating and test voltages. From the breakdown field (Es) for an  insulating medium, the breakdown voltage (Vs) can be approximately calculated from the  relationship (Ryan, 1967 and Ryan and Walley, 1967):     n practice, for the breakdown voltage calculation, \uf068 is numerically equal to the required voltage  de-rating, because it is equal to the ratio of the field stress between parallel plates and the  maximum field at the smaller electrode of a non-uniform configuration with identical spacing.  For the breakdown voltage calculation, Es is usually taken as the breakdown field in the uniform  field case.  g is the electrode separation  \uf068 is the utilization factor, defined as the ratio of average to maximum gradient in the gap.                         a function of electrode spacing are shown in figure 9, Utilization Factor for Various Electrode  Configurations (Dunbar, 1988), for several electrode geometries.    configuration, can also be used to estimate the minimum electrode radius for a given spacing  when the electrical stress capability of the dielectric is known. The utilization factor is  numerically equal to the required voltage de-rating of a configuration. In equation form, it is           example, in kV/mm)  Em is the maximum electric field strength within the space between two conductors spaced at  some distance apart (for example, in kV/mm).   treatise on electric field theory can be found in most texts on electricity and magnetism or  fields and waves. Von Hippel (1954), Greenfield (1972), and Schwaiger and Sorensen (1932)  have written texts on dielectrics that explain the basic principles from field theory. A small  sample of the many relevant texts describing field plotting and analysis are those by Moore  (1927a and 1927b) Bewley (1948), Smythe (1968), Stratton (1941), and Weber (1950).                   or electrodes of any given shape, the variation in potential as a function of the distance from  one electrode to the other electrode can be calculated by solving the differential equations for the  electrostatic field. For simple geometries, such as parallel plates, concentric spheres, and coaxial  cylinders, the equations for the field strength (Schwaiger and Sorensen, 1932) are given below:   Ex is the voltage gradient at a distance x between the electrodes in V/cm  V is potential at the electrodes in volts  s is the spacing between the electrodes in cm   2  1+2      r1 is the inner sphere radius  r2 is the outer sphere radius both in cm        1  2  r1 is the inner cylinder radius  r2 is the outer cylinder radius both in cm  Em is the maximum field gradient at the inner conductor surface in V/cm                                   r is the radius of the spheres (cm)  x is the distance between them (cm)  This is the case where two spheres are located side by side with a gap between them.     1  (/2)\u2212  )          r is the radius of the cylinders  s is the distance between them   n empirical field equation or formula is the shortened, simplified form of a complex equation.  Complex equations, manageable with computers, have traditionally been viewed as difficult and  time consuming to use in everyday design work, especially if the design has to be assembled  piecewise. This is changing with the availability of considerable computing power even in  mobile devices suitable for field work. It is still sometimes advantageous to use empirical  equations for first-order estimations. Furthermore, maximum stress is often the only value  needed in a design, and the plotting of the complete field using a complicated equation is not  necessary. Empirical equations for the maximum field stresses at the smaller electrode spacing  for several electrode configurations are given in table 2, Maximum Field Strength (Em) with a  Potential Difference (V) Between the Electrode Configurations (Bowers and Cath, 1941).

Empirical equations for sparkover gradients in air and sulfur hexafluoride  are published by Mattingley and Ryan (1973) for the configurations shown in figure 9. As an  example, the sparkover electric field for parallel cylinders, at atmospheric pressure in air, was  found to be equal to:       ar  \uf02b  r     ar  \uf02b  r        \uf02b  a/  r    \uf0d7     r   ar  \uf02b  r      \uf0d7    r.  32   ar  \uf02b  r      \uf0d7   r.  32  2  V/  \uf02b  r  a/  r        \uf0d7  V/  r   2  \uf02b  a/  r                ;   where          \uf065   V  1  a  \uf065\uf02b\uf065 a    21  12       0.605  a                                                           where  r is the radius of the cylinders (same for both cylinders) and is 0.098 \uf0a3 r \uf0a3 4.64 mm.       n solids, as in gases, the start of repetitive ionization is the beginning of dielectric breakdown.  Since solid insulation generally has much greater dielectric strength than gaseous insulation,  corona is expected to occur first in the gas surrounding a homogeneous solid dielectric  supporting the electrodes. The CIV in gases can be determined by using established breakdown  curves for various gap distances and electrode configurations because the measurements in the  literature show that the breakdown voltage of a gas in a uniform field is the same as the CIV for  that gas. However, an electrical system is composed of gaps or voids, dielectric material  supporting the electrodes, and electrode material, forming various shapes and electric field  distribution within. Then, the problem is establishing the applied voltage distribution between the  gas and solid portions of the dielectric to predict breakdown threshold voltages. This complex  structure can be modeled in terms of capacitors in series with different dielectric constants to  evaluate the overall system\u2019s dielectric strength. Table 2 shows the potential of two dielectrics  between parallel plates. The potential of capacitors in series can be determined using this  information.   each wire\u2019s insulation and the voltage across the space between the insulation. This voltage  distribution is unlike that encountered in series capacitors where the voltage across the air  capacitor is proportional to the voltage across the solid-insulation capacitor for all applied  voltages. With parallel wires, the thickness of the insulation is constant around the wire, but the  thickness of the gap between wires varies from a minimum in the space between the wires to a  maximum from the far side of one conductor to the far side of the other conductor. This results in  a nonlinear electric field as shown in figure 10, Typical Field Plot of Conductors Showing  Curvilinear Squares from Intersecting Equipotential and Field Lines (MSFC-STD-531).   Figure 10\u2014Typical Field Plot of Conductors Showing Curvilinear Squares From  Intersecting Equipotential and Field Lines                 ound, solid-insulated conductors have a unique field stress, which depends upon the insulated  conductor\u2019s construction and its position with respect to a ground plane. In the case where there  is an air spacing between two solid-insulated round conductors, the electric field configuration is  more complicated, especially as the gas density decreases to a value where the Paschen  minimum is reached. For example, for an insulated wire next to a ground plane, the minimum  spacing will be the thickness of the insulation to the ground plane; for a twisted pair  configuration, the minimum spacing will be twice the thickness of the insulation. Depending on  the operating pressure, the possible breakdown paths, which correspond to the Paschen  minimum, are shown in figure 11, Cross-Sectional View of Twisted-Pair Wire and Wire-to-  Ground Configurations Showing Possible Corona Sites at High Pressure (shorter path) and Low  Pressure (longer path) (MSFC-STD-531, High Voltage Criteria).   Figure 11\u2014Cross Sectional View of (a) Twisted-Pair Wire and (b) Wire-to-Ground  Configurations Showing Possible Corona Sites at High Pressure  (Shorter Path) and Low Pressure (Longer Path)  molecules in the presence of an electric field. After the primary collisions produce new electrons  and ions, these charged particles will gain energy from the field. If the field exceeds some  threshold potential, a fully developed discharge will be established within the electrodes as  electrons multiply through collisions with the molecular gas. Additional electrons are produced  from charged particles colliding with the electrode surfaces. The result will be a fully developed  gaseous discharge. The initiation of this discharge is usually referred to as \u201cthe electrical  breakdown\u201d or \u201cgaseous breakdown.\u201d    aschen\u2019s Law states that the breakdown voltage of a gas in a uniform field is constant if the  product (pd) (where p is the gas pressure, and d is the distance between spaced parallel plate  electrodes), is held constant (Paschen, 1889; Meek and Craggs, 1978). Paschen's Law dictates  that for all gases, the function V = f (pd) has a typical form with a distinct minimum. Gas  breakdown voltage has been shown to also be affected by electrode material and configuration,  and by operating temperature. Paschen\u2019s Law is valid over a wide pressure region, except  pressures beyond 2 to 3 atm and pressures below 10-7 Torr (Von Hippel, 1954). Note for highest                accuracy, at an absolute temperature T (in K) differing from room temperature (T0 = 293 K), the  breakdown voltage should be read at the abscissa value of (pd)\uf0b4(T0/T) (Kind and Karner, 1985).  As gas pressure is increased from standard temperature and pressure, the breakdown voltage is  increased because at higher gas densities the molecules are closer together, and a higher electric  field is required to accelerate the electrons to ionizing energies within the mean free path. The  breakdown voltage decreases as gas density is decreased from standard temperature and pressure  because the longer mean free path permits the electrons to gain more energy before a collision.  As density is further decreased, the voltage decreases until it reaches a minimum value. When  the density is further decreased, the breakdown voltage starts to increase because the density of  the gas is not sufficient to sustain a chain reaction of any ionization at that potential. Finally, the  pressure (therefore, the density) becomes so low that most electrons travel from one electrode to  the other without colliding with a molecule. Examples of Paschen curves for several gases are  shown in figure 12, Breakdown Voltage of Several Gases as a Function of pd at Room  Temperature (Dunbar, 1988).   n some cases, there will be a gas other than pure air surrounding the wire, cables, parts, and  components. Pure air has a relatively high CIV characteristic for either coated or insulated  conductors that allows transients of 320 to 350 V-peak to exist in a corona-free region,  depending on insulation thickness and dielectric properties. Other pure gases such as helium,  hydrogen, and nitrogen or mixtures of one or more of these gases with air during a purge may  result in a lower breakdown voltage characteristic, since the breakdown characteristic is also a  function of the gas composition as well as the pd values. The breakdown voltage of helium as a  function of the product pd is shown in figure 13, Paschen Curve of Helium as a Function of pd at  Room Temperature. A mixture of 10 percent hydrogen in air will have a breakdown voltage of             0.91 times that of pure air, as shown in figure 14, Breakdown Voltage of Hydrogen-Air Mixture  as a Function of Hydrogen Percentage in Air.   Figure 14\u2014Breakdown Voltage of Hydrogen-Air Mixture as a Function of Hydrogen  Percentage in Air  he Paschen minimum voltage for air, which is 327 Vdc, occurs at a pd dimension of 0.7 Torr-  cm at room temperature (23 \uf0b0C). Wires and parts may have spacing from less than 0.1 mm to a  few centimeters, depending upon the construction, application, location, and shielding  requirements. This implies that some parts within the electrical system may be subjected to either  voltage breakdown, corona, partial discharges, or glow discharges when the space vehicle is at  altitudes greater than approximately 12.19 km (40,000 ft) during launch and approximately 9.15  km (30,000 ft) during reentry. The reason for the lower altitude during reentry is the higher  temperature and inhibited airflow into the compartments during reentry.  here possible, it is advisable to design high voltage systems so that the separation between  high voltage surfaces is smaller than the electron mean free path for a collision. The pressure               corresponding to minimum CIV depends on the spacing of the electrodes. For a 1-cm spacing in  air at room temperature, this pressure occurs between 0.5 and 1.0 Torr. A representative  minimum CIV for air is 327 Vdc. In comparison, the CIV for the same contact configuration at  760 Torr (1 atm) is 31.2 kV.  n general, for each electrode spacing there is a unique pressure at which minimum CIV occurs  as shown in figure 15, Corona Onset Voltage Between Parallel Plates at Several Spacings  (Dunbar, 1966). Thus, the minimum CIV will occur over a wide range of altitudes in the  electrical system on a space vehicle having many components with a variety of spacing between  conductors, contacts, and terminations. The minimum pd dimension is constant for a wide  pressure variation and for many spacings inside a space vehicle. Since the CIV and breakdown  voltage of a gas are functions of gas density and spacing (pd), the corona or breakdown can start  when the pressure between closely spaced (2 mils or 5.1x10-3 cm) electrodes is as high as 125  Torr and continues through to the longest distance between an energized electrode and a ground  plane, until a pressure of less than 0.02 Torr (spacing = 20 cm) is obtained (Dunbar, 1966).  Initially this appears extreme until the designer can visually observe the length of the breakdown  path between an electrode on a card and the furthest metal ground plane.   t should be noted that the pressure between electrodes is different from the external pressure and  would be greatly reduced through ventilation as the vehicle is traveling between Earth and space.  In some instances, the time lag can exist until well after the vehicle reaches orbit altitude because  of outgassing of insulation and containers within the vehicle.              depend on an external source of ionization as well. There is generally a time delay between the  application of voltage and corona. This time delay varies statistically and is a function of the  difference between the applied voltage and the critical voltage. Ultraviolet (UV) and high-energy  radiations reduce the time delay considerably.   hen radioactive cobalt-60 or a gamma emitter is used as an ionizer, it affects corona in three  ways. First, it lowers the CIV of the gaseous environment slightly; second, it raises the intensity  of the intermittent corona; and third, it may alter the mechanical and electrical properties of the  insulation to make the material either more or less corona resistant. Irradiated polyethylene is an  example of a material that is changed by radiation to be more corona resistant. Its increased  corona resistance after irradiation results from an increase in ability to shrink and bond to itself  to form a structure with fewer voids (Von Hippel, 1954). Radiation effects on dielectric materials  are investigated by Stojadinovic et al. (2001); Mackersie et al. (2001); Amjadi (2000); Krieg et  al. (2000); Given et al. (2000); and Lee et al. (2000).  sustaining, hence are extinguished. The region from Vg to the critical voltage is called the  Geiger-counter regime (Loeb, 1965). The frequency of the pulses in this region generally  depends on the intensity of the external ionizing agents present.    n the space environment, the ambient temperature variation can be large because of solar  heating effects. The onboard instrumentation and power systems are designed to operate in this  wide ambient temperature range, typically from negative 55 \uf0b0C to positive 155 \uf0b0C for vehicles in  low Earth orbit. In addition to this ambient temperature variation, the instruments can see local  temperature changes related to dielectric losses, partial discharges, corona discharges, electrical  breakdown, or fully developed arc or glow discharges. This section discusses testing needed to  ensure that high voltage systems can operate under conditions of significant temperature  excursion. Failure to do so is potentially catastrophic since the physical effects discussed with  respect to test will also occur in operations.         0   where  T0 is room temperature in K (293K)  Tt is operating temperature of the equipment in K (maximum temperature of the equipment)  P0 is nominal operating pressure in Torr  Pt is test chamber pressure in Torr               lso, the breakdown voltage may be related to temperature and altitude by using the U.S.  Standard Atmosphere\u2014Pressure chart, which gives the air-density factor as a function of  altitude. Thus, for corona test purposes, it is possible to simulate any altitude and temperature in  a room-temperature chamber containing gas at an appropriate pressure. However, this simulated  test environment ignores higher order effects from chemical and thermal dielectric deterioration,  which would occur at a temperature other than room temperature.  likelihood of corona, glow discharge, or electrical breakdown. Any sustained discharge will heat  the gas locally (around conductors) as well as in enclosed spaces (voids). The resulting  temperature rise will change the extinction voltage, thus giving inconsistent results. This effect  has less impact in the vicinity of the Paschen minimum. Readings at higher pd values will be  influenced by temperature rise during the test. When testing for partial discharges in voids of  solid dielectrics, internal temperature rises because of sustained discharges affecting CIV and  CEV. When the walls of the void are heated by dielectric losses, the insulation outgases,  changing the gas pressure and possibly the gas mixture inside the void. This affects the voltage  difference between the CIV and CEV across a simple void in a solid dielectric, resulting in test  results that are not representative of operational conditions. When testing for pd or corona, test  engineers must keep in mind that testing itself can temporarily alter the sample. Caution should  be taken to obtain valid data.    having two different fixed spacings are shown in figure 16, Corona Between Nichrome Wires in  Heated Chamber (Dunbar, 1988), and figure 17, Corona Initiation Voltage as a Function of  Temperature and Pressure for Parallel Wires in a Heated Chamber (Dunbar, 1988). The test data  indicate a small variation in the minimum CIV at temperatures between 500 and 1100 \u00b0C but little  or no change from 23 to 500 \u00b0C.

In addition, when  molybdenum materials are located in an oxidizing atmosphere they should be isolated to prevent  molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) formation from evaporating and depositing on cooler parts. The  CIV data, as a function of temperature and pressure, obtained between two MoO3-contaminated  titanium wires spaced in a depressurized air-filled chamber is shown in figure 18, Corona Onset  Voltage of Nickel-Clad Wires in a Molybdenum-Contaminated Oven. The wires did not corrode  or show signs of evaporation at temperature less than 500 \u00b0C. As the temperature was increased,  MoO3 evaporated and deposited on the cooled vacuum chamber walls. The multitude of MoO3  molecules between the conductors carried the conduction current when a voltage exceeding the  CIV was applied to the wires (Harwood, 1958).            that can interfere with the operation of other equipment. In one study, when the frequency  spectrum of the noise generated by discharges between parallel wires was measured at three  pressure-spacing (pd) dimensions, the following results were obtained (Dunbar, 1983).    . As pressure is decreased to 30 Torr, the higher frequencies are attenuated  significantly as shown in figure 19, Frequency Spectrum at Corona Pressure (Dunbar, 1983).  . Two situations exist for the low-pressure region. For glow discharge inception, the  frequency range is from 15 to 30 kHz as shown in figure 20, Frequency Spectrum at 0.75 Torr,  647 Volts for #16 AWG Solid Copper Wires Spaced 4.8 cm (Dunbar, 1983). The data were  taken between parallel wires using EMI test requirements and equipment. However, if the  voltage is raised to include streamers (sparking) within the glow discharge region, which is an  over-voltage of at least 30 V-peak above glow discharge initiation, the frequency spectrum  increases to the values shown in figure 21, Frequency Spectrum at Glow Discharge Pressure  (Dunbar, 1983).  Figure 18\u2014Corona Onset Voltage of Nickel-Clad Wires in a  Molybdenum-Contaminated Oven                 Figure 20\u2014Frequency Spectrum at 0.75 Torr, 647 Volts for #16 AWG  Solid Copper Wires Spaced 4.8 cm                  These data are important when measuring corona discharges at low pressure with corona system  test equipment. As an example, test equipment that has a low-frequency cut-off at 40 kHz will  not detect the lower frequencies of glow discharge at initiation. The low-intensity radiated  emissions spectra produced by a glow discharge may not be considered detrimental to electrical  and electronic system hardware, but this should be confirmed by comparison with the  certification performance data for the hardware under consideration.   a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Although nitrogen has a much lower breakdown  characteristic than oxygen, a highly electro-negative gas, the presence of oxygen in nitrogen will  raise the breakdown voltage as shown in figure 22, Onset Voltage of Gases and Gas Mixtures  between 0.25-in. Round Rods (Dunbar, 1966). Other outgassing products and gases will also  combine with the nitrogen-oxygen mixture, but the small quantity will not have any significant  effect on the total breakdown characteristic.                 he breakdown voltage between a pair of 5.0-cm diameter parallel plate circular electrodes  spaced 0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 cm apart was determined for pure helium, pure oxygen, and helium-  oxygen mixtures. The data shown in figure 23, Parallel Plates in Helium-Oxygen (Dunbar,  1966), imply that corona and voltage breakdown can appear on the bare or very thinly insulated  conductors of a 200 V-rms ac electrical system when the mixture contains more than 80 percent  helium by volume. Such a system would require special corona and voltage breakdown  precautions.   the helium-oxygen gases. The test results are shown in figure 24, Round Rods in Nitrogen-  Oxygen Gas Mixture (Dunbar, 1966). These curves show that the CIV cannot be determined by a  linear interpolation of the component gases. For some gas mixtures, there are pressures and  spacings where the CIV is less than that of either component gas. Either neon or argon when  mixed with oxygen shows this characteristic.                    lights to keep the starting or initiation voltage within acceptable limits for display purposes.  These gases, if used in spacecraft hardware, should be kept away from high voltage to avoid  corona issues.   ost high-voltage breakdown and partial discharge information available in the literature has  been developed for 60-Hz utility power system equipment. In spite of the lack of information for  systems operating above 60 Hz, spacecraft electrical and electronic designers have used  published power system partial discharge and corona testing techniques and data for power  conversion designs with reasonable success. However, it was determined early in the space  program that the use of very low frequency partial discharge criteria leads to failures when  applied to high-frequency, high-density packaging, specifically when non-sinusoidal frequencies  greater than 20 kHz were introduced for weight and volume saving (Bunker, 1970). Fortunately,  many of the early designs used vacuum tube technology, which included reasonably slow rise  times compared to today\u2019s high-speed switching devices. Instead of determining the cause of the  failures for the early power conversion components, it was agreed among engineers that  spacecraft high-voltage packages should have average electric field stresses less than 2000  V/mm and maximum field stresses less than 5000 V/mm. This field stress limitation reduced the  failure rates to acceptable limits.  ater, experimental data published in August et al. (1967) and August and Chown (1970)  showed that the high-frequency breakdown between conductors spaced greater than 0.04 cm              apart was considerably less than the breakdown voltage at very low frequencies for pd values  greater than 50 Torr-cm. For very closely spaced electrodes (less than 0.04 cm), the breakdown  voltage was the same for frequencies from 50 Hz to 2 MHz for pd values greater than 50 Torr-  cm. At pd values greater than Paschen minimum, Paschen\u2019s Law does not hold for high  frequencies (figure 25, Breakdown at High Frequency in Air in Inhomogeneous Field (Prowse,  1950 and Lassen, 1931), and figure 26, Breakdown at High Frequency in Air (Smaller Values of  (d/mm)) in Inhomogeneous Field (Pim, 1949).              Figure 26\u2014Breakdown at High Frequency in Air (Smaller Values of d (mm))  in Inhomogeneous Field  During the first reported spacecraft high-frequency electronic failure (Bunker, 1965 and Bunker,  1970), it was assumed that the breakdown phenomenon that occurred at pressures between  1 Torr and vacuum were related to high-frequency effects. This led to the development of the  voltage breakdown versus high-frequency breakdown curve shown in figure 27, Variation of RF  Breakdown Voltage With Pressure Illustrating the Pressure Transition Region From Gas  Discharge to Multipactor (August and Chown, 1969, and August and Chown, 1970). This curve  was based on the limited information published in the book by Meek and Craggs (1978) plus the  high-frequency and multipactor voltage breakdown reports given in Prowse (1950); Lassen  (1931); Pim (1949); Labrum (1947); Hughes Aircraft Company (July 1966); Vaughn (1968);  Mohr and Putz (1966); Lewis and McCarty (1966); Wachowski (1964); Woo (1968a); Ishamaru  and Woo (1967); MacDonald and Brown (1949); and Herlin and Brown (1948). The subject of  multipactor is developed more fully in section 6.3.5.                 Figure 27\u2014Variation of RF Breakdown Voltage With Pressure Illustrating the Pressure  Transition Region From Gas Discharge to Multipactor  he breakdown voltage for very low RF frequencies is the same as the dc value; however, at  high frequencies, the breakdown mechanism is complicated by electron resonances resulting in  cumulative ionization. Hence, lower breakdown voltages are experienced relative to those  predicted on the basis of dc (Bunker, 1966).  igure 28, Breakdown Voltage for a 0.4-mm Gap in Air at Atmospheric Pressure as a Function  of Frequency (Prowse, 1950), is a plot of data in the literature and is limited to pressure-spacing  dimensions greater than 30 Torr-cm for frequencies where multipaction is not an issue. This  curve is presented based on available data in the literature: region A is by Lassen (1931), B is by  Pim (1949), and C is by Labrum (1947). The curve intends to illustrate main features only, since  continuous observations over the whole range of frequency do not exist.  Figure 28\u2014Breakdown Voltage for a 0.4-mm Gap in Air  at Atmospheric Pressure as a Function of Frequency                 As solid-state devices developed, switching speeds increased. Also, improved magnetic material  development led to power conversion repetition rates ranging from 20 kHz to over 100 kHz.  Further, high-density packaging development progressed through the selection of higher  frequencies. With these developments, physically smaller electrical parts reduced the spacing  between small rounded surfaces and part volumes and weights, forcing designers to pay more  attention to the electrical field stresses within the insulation system.   Configuration and Spacing, shows the results of an experiment (Dunbar et al., 1998) to  determine the corona initiation of a long antenna in a very large diameter vacuum chamber.  Measured parameters were the CIV and CEV at frequencies from 60 Hz to over 60 kHz at  pressures of 10 to 50 Torr. The results of these experiments concluded that the corona initiation  in air was reasonably stable from 60 Hz to 40 kHz. As seen in the curve labeled \u201cantenna,\u201d the  CIV decreased above 40 kHz to 85 percent of the 60 Hz value. This was a significant finding,  implying very small conductors or square-edged conductors, as used on printed circuit boards,  surrounded by an air gap will have lower CIV when the frequency exceeds 40 kHz for pd  dimensions greater than 50 Torr-cm. The data in figure 29 are taken from published literature.  Dotted lines are expected (or extrapolated) curves, and the large dots are the data in the literature.  Figure 29\u2014Frequency De-rating of Paschen\u2019s Law at High Frequencies for Different  Electrode Configuration and Spacing   the same EMI detection equipment with little modification to the EMI specification. Normally,  the EMI test is determined in a \u201croom ambient\u201d environment. For the partial discharge part of the  test, the test article should be placed in a vacuum chamber, if viable, to simulate the operational  environment. For spacecraft equipment, the test pressure should be adjusted to assure coverage  of the Paschen minimum pd dimensions for the test article while conducting EMI measurements.  By comparison of the radiated emissions signature at one atmosphere pressure with those at             lower operational pressures, differences in the frequency spectra can be identified that may be  attributed to glow discharges and partial discharges. The discharge frequencies to be assessed are  well defined by Pfeiffer (1991a and 1991b) and Pfeiffer et al. (1987). Note that published data  indicate the breakdown voltage in air between parallel plates spaced less than 1 mm apart is  constant from 20 Hz to 100 kHz (Prowse, 1950; Lassen, 1931; Pim, 1949; Labrum, 1947;  Dunbar et al., 1998; Pfeiffer, 1991a; and Buchalla, et al., 1992).   little change in the Paschen minimum from 50 Hz to 2 MHz for breakdown between parallel  plates. Above 2 MHz, there is a drastic drop to the multipactor breakdown region, which  continues up to 200 MHz. Above 5 GHz, the minimum breakdown voltage rises again, because  the multipactor phenomena are not observed since the resonant electrons cannot keep up with  this high frequency of the field. (Walter and Hershberger, 1946; Herlin and Brown, 1948;  Prowse, 1950; He and Hall, 1984; Sato and Haydon, 1984a and 1984b; Damas and Robiscoe,  1988; Seebok and Koehler, 1988; Suganomata et al., 1989; Vlieks et al., 1989; Bourat and Joly,  1989; Saito, 1995; and Galstjan and Ravaev, 1995).  s more data become available, it is recommended that a plot of voltage breakdown as a  function of frequency be made available to engineers developing high-density packaging for  spacecraft. In the meantime, designers are encouraged to use the following partial discharge  initiation voltage information shown in table 3, High-Frequency Voltage Breakdown Criteria  (Woo, 1968a).    0.06 to 980 kHz  0.06 to 40 kHz  60 kHz to 1.0 MHz  950 MHz to 3 GHz  60 GHz  VOLTAGE  (V-PEAK)  327  327  260  39  327   Parallel plate (spaced: 0.01 to 0.04 cm)  Antenna  Antenna and sharp edges  Waveguide (all metal)  Waveguide  handbook, Graves (2014), captures much of the work done in the past ten years and will prove an  invaluable reference.    is a resonant RF discharge, sustained by the emission of secondary electrons from the walls of  the RF devices such as waveguides and RF connectors. Multipactor breakdown may occur when  secondary electrons are produced on an electrode surface and are accelerated in a gap toward  another electrode surface so that they reach the second electrode in a half-period of the applied  RF field. Upon striking the second electrode, the electrons create new secondary electrons, which  are accelerated back across the gap toward the primary electrode during the next half-period,            producing more electrons there, as shown in figure 30, Multipactor Discharge: Electron  Resonance in an RF Field With Discharge Sustained by Secondary Emission (Dunbar, 1983).  These electrons accelerated across the gap gain their energy from the applied RF field (Hughes  Aircraft Company, 1966; Wachowski, 1964; Woo, 1968a and 1968b; and Galan et al., 1988). For  most materials, the secondary electron emission yield, that is, the ratio of emitted secondary  electrons to the number of incident electrons becomes greater than unity if the impact energy is  sufficiently high. Thus, the number of electrons participating in a discharge increases when the  coefficient of secondary emission is greater than 1.0 and multipactor breakdown occurs.  Occurrence of a multipactor discharge depends primarily on the RF voltage and frequency levels,  gap spacing, electrode surface condition (roughness and cleanliness), secondary electron  emission coefficient of the electrode material, and the operating pressure (vacuum environment).  Since the multipactor discharge is an electron resonance phenomenon, it is independent of the  nature of the gaseous environment under which the RF system is operating.  n practical systems, operating pressure is usually very low such that the mean-free-path of  electrons for collision with molecules is much larger than the gap length, (d), and the voltage  level is in a range such that the accelerated free electrons can gain the right amount of kinetic  energy from the field to be in resonance.  Figure 30\u2014Multipactor Discharge: Electron Resonance in an RF Field  with Discharge Sustained by Secondary Emission  enerally speaking, the existence of multipaction does not imply an immediate component  failure. However, long-term effects, such as erosion or physical damage of the cables and other  component surfaces, may lead to an eventual failure. For instance, it is possible for multipaction  to occur in a transmitting antenna in which only a small percentage of the transmitted power is  dissipated in the multipactor, resulting in localized heating. The result in decreased or increased  radiated power and an increase in the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) may be negligible,  and the system may continue to operate with no other adverse effects. On the other hand, if the  antenna were used in a duplex system where transmitting and receiving occurred simultaneously  on different channels, the antenna noise caused by the multipactor may blank out the receiving  channel and thus make the system partially inoperable. The total system should be considered to  estimate the effects of multipaction with respect to system performance.  multipaction will not occur. Frequency-temperature-pressure testing should be required to ensure  product multipactor-free acceptability.              Although a multipacting breakdown is a resonance phenomenon, it is not required that a unique  set of operating conditions occur (Nanevicz and Vance, 1967; Hughes Aircraft Company, 1966;  and Galan et al., 1988). There is a wide range of combinations of gap spacing, operating  frequency, and voltage over which multipacting may be observed. However, there is a lower  threshold voltage below which the discharge does not occur. In addition, for a given electrode  spacing, there exists a cut-off frequency below which the discharge does not occur. Multipactor  discharges can occur over a wide range of frequencies above the cut-off frequency. Furthermore,  in a configuration where more than one path length is available, less frequency selectivity would  be experienced.  Multipaction is usually experienced at frequencies greater than 70 MHz. The effect of  multipacting on the Paschen curve over a range of pressures is illustrated in figure 27.  Multipaction does not occur until the mean free path is larger than the gap, that is, below the  Paschen minimum. Most communications between a spacecraft and a ground station take place  at frequencies in the 20 MHz to 30 GHz range. The design and fabrication practices for this  frequency range are different than for 60 Hz-ac or dc systems.  he transmitting system is affected in many different ways by multipaction (Hughes Aircraft  Company, 1966). There is some RF power lost in exciting the electrons. When sufficient gas  molecules are present, ionization can occur, which can cause corona with the resultant  breakdown between plates. The impact of the electrons on the surface can cause heating and  outgassing. When the load on the RF source is reactive, it causes detuning of the output circuits.  Multipaction would usually generate higher order harmonics in the output of the transmitter.  Also, RF noise is generated by multipactor effects, which can interfere with nearby receiving  equipment. All these effects may not happen at the same time, and the antenna may be perfectly  useful as a radiator after a breakdown. However, its efficiency with respect to total radiated  power will be drastically reduced as shown in figure 31, Power Decrease Caused by Multipactor  (Dunbar, 1983), for an RF coupler with intermittent multipaction. These symptoms of  multipactor effects should not be interpreted as indication for other failure modes.   lectrode spacing, frequency, electrode configuration, and the applied voltage are all to be  considered when evaluating design parameters for the elimination of multipaction. Figure 32,  Possible Regions of Multipacting Between Parallel Plates (Dunbar, 1983), displays one set of  relationships among those parameters. The top scale is electrode separation divided by  wavelength, both in the same units. The three regions indicated by 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 are where  multipacting can occur. The electrons that correspond to the region marked 1/2 have a transit             time of T/2, where T =1/f. Those in region 3/2 have a transit time of 3T/2, and 5/2 is 5T/2.  Unfortunately, a general plot of this sort cannot be relied upon for design data, because the  values depend on factors such as the number of electrodes, electrode material, surface conditions,  and geometry, for example, parallel plates, coaxial, or edges. The designer is forced to test each  design at various stages of fabrication to be certain that multipacting does not occur.          When considering the use of foam, the designer is to consider the density of the foam, its  application, the gas enclosed in the cells, and the cellular breakdown of the foam. For some  applications, the foam may be ineffective or detrimental as a function of time in the presence of  temperature cycling.  xamples of breakdown discharge data for parallel plate electrode configuration are shown in  figure 33, Multipactor Discharge Characteristics of Various Surface Materials as a Function of fd  for Two Different Operating Frequencies (430 and 100 MHz) for Parallel Plate Electrode  Configuration, Hughes Aircraft Company (1966), for several electrode materials as a function of           fd, the operating frequency (f) times electrode separation (d) for two frequencies. These data may  be used to closely estimate the minimum breakdown voltage for a particular fd dimension and a  particular electrode material. Specifically, the data show that dielectric materials have higher  multipactor initiation voltage than the metallic electrodes (Hughes Aircraft Company, 1966).  Therefore, using an anti-corrosion coating (dielectric material) on waveguide internal metallic  surface improves the multipactor initiation voltage. The anti-corrosion material needs to be only  a few microns thick, but it must be well bonded to the waveguide metallic surface (100 percent  bonding).         Figure 33\u2014Multipactor Discharge Characteristics of Various Surface Materials as a  Function of fd for Two Different Operating Frequencies (430 and 100 MHz) for Parallel  Plate Electrode Configuration           Multipactor effect and breakdown can also be seen in coaxial transmission lines or coaxial  electrode geometries operating in the space environment (Woo 1968a; and Ishimaru and Woo  (1967). Figure 34, Multipacting Region for Coaxial Electrodes With Varying Values of b/a  (Woo, 1968a), shows the RF breakdown voltage data as a function of fd obtained for coaxial  electrodes in vacuum where b and a are the radius of the outer and inner conductors,  respectively.   n summary, multipactor breakdown is a hazard that may occur in RF equipment subjected to  low-pressure space environments. Components such as printed circuit boards, conventional  wiring, multi-pin connectors, and variable capacitors have all experienced multipaction in space.  Failure experience usually initiates with multipaction, followed by dielectric heating, materials  outgassing, and finally gaseous breakdown. Potting, foaming, or dielectric coatings tend to  reduce the risk of multipactor breakdown phenomena; however, small open voids between  electrodes within a foam or improper coating may result in multipaction. As a rule, foam  products are considered a poor choice because there is a high probability of open pores between  closely spaced electrodes. Using a solid dielectric is the best way to eliminate multipaction.  However, joints and connectors with very small spacings between mated surfaces can result in  multipaction. Printed circuit board and component cleanliness is mandatory. Dust particles or  small setae will result in lowered multipactor voltage breakdown. Pressurization of RF             containing a conductive contaminant may produce enough heat to generate a track of carbon.  This conductive path tends to reduce the capability of the insulator to hold off the voltage and  may result in electrical breakdown. The surface erodes without producing a track in some  materials. Fillers effectively reduce the tracking tendency of organic materials. Eroding  materials, such as acrylics, do not require filler protection. To lengthen the surface creepage path,  tracking can also be controlled by reducing the voltage stress on the surface by applying petticoat  insulation configurations. A bibliography on surface flashover, surface creepage, and tracking on  or within solid insulation is cited in Bashara et al. (1965); Billings and Humphreys (1968);  Billings et al. (1967); Billings et al. (1971); Chapman et al. (1955); Dakin and Mullen (1972);  Frisco and Chapman (1956); Kurtz (1971); Mason (1960); Orbeck and Niemi (1973); Toriyama  et al. (1971); Wallace and Bailey (1967); Wu and Cheng (1978).    filler. The finished product will then be able to withstand higher voltage stress than the original  porcelain. In time, surface erosion and exposure to UV radiation will degrade the epoxy-based  laminate to a level inferior to the porcelain.  igure 35, Flashover Test Fixture (Dunbar, 1988), shows the test fixture used to evaluate the  flashover voltage measured between 1.9 cm-diameter washers mounted on an uncoated glass  epoxy-bond laminate. The flashover voltage initiation as a function of spacing is shown at three  frequencies in figure 36, Effect of Spacing on the Initial Values of Strength for Fixture Shown in  figure 35 (Dunbar, 1988). The impulse and steady-state flashover voltage stresses are shown for  the same configuration in table 4, Comparison of Steady and Impulse Flashover Stress V/cm  (peak) for Glass Epoxy-Bond Laminates (Dunbar 1988).  equipment is a positive method for multipactor elimination when viable. Finally, the correct  choice of materials and configuration is very important as shown in figure 33.               Figure 36\u2014Effect of Spacing on the Initial Values of  Strength for Fixture Shown in Figure 35  TEST  (DURATION: 1 MIN)  Table 4\u2014Comparison of Steady and Impulse Flashover  Stress V/cm (Peak) for Glass Epoxy-Bond Laminates  AVERAGE FLASHOVER  STRENGTH FOR 1-CM  SPACING (KV)  14.1  14.9  16.7  17.1  18.6  60 Hz  dc Positive  dc Negative  Positive  Negative     low-loss, low-dielectric-constant class of material, exhibits the smallest decrease in flashover  strength with respect to increasing frequency.  igh dielectric constant materials have much lower resistance to surface voltage creepage than  the low dielectric constant materials. Figure 37, Variation of Flashover Voltage with Changing             Insulation Dielectric Constant (Luck, 1967), is an illustration showing the advantage in selecting  the correct dielectric constant. The flashover breakdown factor in the illustration represents the  results of many measurements, showing how a decreasing flashover voltage can be expected  across the dielectric when insulations of progressively higher dielectric constants are used.     ll materials have lower flashover strength at higher frequencies. The example given in figure 38,  Effect of Frequency on Flashover Strength for Configuration Shown in figure 35, illustrates that the  surface flashover strength changes magnitude with frequency. The flashover strength of glass-cloth  epoxy-based laminate (G-10) is shown at three different frequencies as a function of spacing in air  at 23 \u00b0C in figure 36, and the effect of frequency on surface flashover for polyethylene (PE) is seen  in figure 39, Effect of Frequency on the Electric Strength of PE. Further, table 5, Polyethylene  Dielectric Strength (in V/mil) for 30-mil Sheets as a Function of Temperature and Frequency  (Luck, 1967), and table 6, Teflon\u00ae Dielectric Strength (in V/mil) for 30-mil Sheets as a Function of  Temperature and Frequency (Luck, 1967), show the dielectric strength of PE and Teflon\u00ae  (respectively) as a function of frequency and temperature (Luck, 1967).                  imited data indicate improvement or degradation of the flashover properties of materials when  the system is subjected to a combination of magnetic field and impulse voltages. Few effects are  noted for magnetic fields less than 3 to 4 Tesla. For higher magnetic fields, the flashover strength  is either improved or degraded, depending on the polarization of the interacting fields (Korzekwa  et al., 1989).    t is useful to determine the relationship between flashover strength at 25 \uf0b0C and other  temperatures. For gaseous breakdown in a uniform field, this relationship involves the ratio of  the gas densities at the two temperatures. To test this relationship, it is only necessary to multiply  the 25 \uf0b0C value by the factor (25 + 273)/(T + 273), which is the inverse ratio of the absolute  temperatures involved. This ratio is part of the well-known air density correction factor, which is  commonly used in spark-gap measurements over a considerable range of density and gap  spacing. However, this may not hold true for surface flashover, because there are other factors,  such as outgassing, surface charging, and triple point effects, involved in surface flashover  events. Figure 40, Effect of Temperature on 60-Hz Flashover Stress (Dunbar, 1988), displays the  effect of temperature on a 60-Hz surface flashover stress. The broken lines in this figure show  the values obtained when this factor is applied to 25 \uf0b0C flashover values. Thermionic emission  does not become a factor until the temperature approaches 700 \uf0b0C for most metals or until the  material tends to change state via severe outgassing or polymerization. As a rule, the flashover  voltage appears to increase as temperature in the system increases as shown in tables 5 and 6.

Ice and snow do not appreciably reduce the effective flashover strength. The  selection of insulating materials resistant to surface wetting and moisture absorption will greatly  facilitate the maintenance of original flashover strengths. A water-repellent treatment will aid on  materials that are easily wetted. As an example, table 7, Environmental Effects on Surface  Flashover at 60 Hz, shows environmental effects on flashover for glass cloth and polystyrene. A  safety factor of 2 is recommended where humidity can go to 100 percent with condensation.  Where dirt, dust, and residual ions from plating baths, etc., may contaminate the surface between  electrodes, the flashover (creepage) path should be made to be 2 to 3 times the minimum air  spacing.                  85 \u00b0C (dry)  125 \u00b0C (dry)  25 \u00b0C (100% RH)  50 \u00b0C (100% RH)  25 \u00b0C (100% RH)  50 \u00b0C (100% RH)  1 HOUR  7.8  7.0  9.5  8.8  1.7  10.3    a3.6  a2.4  a2.5  a2.4  9.0  9.4  a2.5  a2.4   9.4  9.3  5.5  5.1  Glass cloth  (kV)  Polystyrene  (kV)  aInternal flashover.   electromagnetic spectrum. A typical dielectric material (solid or liquid) may have four distinct  resonant regions as shown in figure 41, Dielectric Polarization (Dunbar, 1988). Between these  resonant frequencies, the dielectric constant appears to have constant values for the real part of  the dielectric constant as a function of frequency. These resonances are the result of polarization  induced by the applied field at that particular frequency. The distinct regions correspond to  different physical mechanisms by which the material responds to the time-varying electric field.  At very low frequencies, the material tracks the field through all four mechanisms so they all  contribute to the polarization and the resulting change in dielectric constant. As the frequency  increases, each mechanism in turn becomes unable to keep up with the field and ceases to  contribute.   the imaginary part (k\u2033). In general, the interfacial polarization (\u03b1s) may occur at up to several  thousand Hertz, depending on the temperature and relaxation time of the material. The dipole  polarization (\u03b1d) would occur from 104 to 1012 Hz. Raising or lowering the material temperature  can respectively increase or decrease the resonance frequency for both of these effects, shown  graphically as curves T1-T3. The atomic polarization (\u03b1a) is in the visible and near infrared  frequency range, and the electronic polarization (\u03b1e) occurs at frequencies above the optical  frequency range (cosmic rays such as x-rays, vacuum UV, and other radiation frequencies).  When a material is operated at a frequency that includes one or more of the polarization regions  (resonant frequencies), the dielectric will absorb energy from the field, resulting in dielectric  heating.                                          ielectric materials used for electronic designs should be evaluated for a change of dielectric  constant as a function of frequency to determine polarization effects. The dielectric constant of  many materials as a function of frequency is given in Von Hippel (1954). The interfacial  polarization is broadband and may be further broadened by wide temperature excursions. This  implies that an electronic circuit should be evaluated through the full operating temperature  range, instead of the temperature extremes (Greenfield, 1972).   electrical properties. Dielectric strengths and dielectric constants are well documented for  high-voltage materials. Fewer data are available, however, on the dissipation factor, also called  loss tangent, which is defined as       is the ac conductivity  \u03c9 is the frequency in rad/s.  \u03b5 is the permittivity   Elevated values of the dissipation factor cause the dielectric heating in the insulation system and  result in power loss. There are some frequency ranges for a given dielectric material for which  the dissipation factor is above the acceptable design requirements. The system should be                operated in a regime where the dielectric constant has a constant value over the operating  frequency and temperature ranges, and the dissipation factor should be relatively low to avoid  dielectric heating and instability of the impedances. If the dielectric properties are functions of  temperature, operating conditions have to be controlled to provide stable and predictable system  performance. Most measurements of dissipation factors are made at 1000 Hz and 23 \u00b0C, but  quite often the insulation has to function between 400 Hz and 1 MHz and at \u201340 to +200 \u00b0C. As  a result, the designer has the problem of measuring the dissipation factor or searching for  meaningful data and tends to extrapolate whatever data are available to the desired frequency  range. This may be an important problem because electronic circuits, if operated near the  frequency singularities, can be affected by fluctuating inter-electrode capacitance changes (Von  Hippel, 1954; and Greenfield, 1972).   of the particular polarization involved becomes equal to or less than the period of the applied  field. In general, \uf061s is effective up to several thousand Hertz; \uf061d can be effective from 104 up to  1012 Hz, and even this wide range can be increased further into the low-frequency area by  reducing temperatures; \uf061a becomes effective in the infrared spectrum and \uf061e in the optical region  and above.   the statistical average breakdown of constant thickness samples. These values should be used  with caution in equipment design for the following reasons:      or example, the following four figures from Dunbar (1968), show the effect on the dielectric  strength data for Kapton\u00ae-H film taken at different environmental and mechanical conditions:                 Figure 42, Temperature Effects on ac Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, figure 43,  High Humidity Effects on the Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, figure 44, Insulation  Thickness Effects on Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, and figure 45, Film Area  Versus Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film.                   n spacecraft applications, the highest average operating temperature for a unit is usually  specified (60 \u00b0C is typical). This temperature should not be taken as the insulation design value.  The insulation design temperature has to be that of the hottest point within the equipment. For  instance, the hot spot created by high current densities near an electrical component may be as  much as 20 \u00b0C higher than the nominal temperature in the insulation.  ost insulation test samples are either 1 or 5 mil thick. In high-voltage work, thin insulation has  insufficient dielectric strength, often requiring composite insulations having several layers. The  dielectric strength (V/mil) of insulation decreases with thickness, as shown in figure 44.   data sheets. A deviation of dielectric strength can be caused by roughness of electrode surfaces  and non-uniform thickness of the manufactured insulation. Because of these effects, a de-rating  of the manufacturer\u2019s data is generally needed. For areas of a few square centimeters, a less than               5-percent de-rating of the manufacturer\u2019s dielectric strength data is usually sufficient. For large  areas, the required de-rating is considerable, as shown in figure 45.  Finally, it should be noted that recent work indicates that many quoted values of dielectric  strength are in error as the samples were not properly outgassed, dried out, etc. This has become  a particular issue in space applications where materials need to be tested at very low  temperatures, high vacuum, and under radiation environments. For a discussion of problems and  issues with previous dielectric measurements, see Dennison (2014).  he first published treeing experiments were demonstrated by Kitchin and Pratt (1962). In that  work, a sharpened sewing needle was partially embedded in a block of polyethylene and used as  one of the electrodes. The base of the square block, 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 6.5 mm thick, was  placed on a metal plate that served as the other electrode. The voltage was adjusted until one half  of a group of samples initiated a \u201ctree\u201d within one hour. This was named \u201cthe characteristic  voltage.\u201d  ver the years, investigators have argued about the initiation mechanism of an electrical tree. A  probable cause is the bombardment of the surface of the insulation adjacent to a high electrical  field stress by high-energy electrons. The source of the electrons may be high-intensity  ionization in a void, the field emission from the surface of a point, or the emission from an  impurity embedded in a non-homogeneous insulation system.  spreads along the molecular interfaces rather than atomically. Thus, the tree branches may  disperse throughout the insulation, eventually resulting in electrical failure. Experimentally, it  has been determined that the tree is often initiated by a large electrical pulse inducing charges  exceeding 200 pC. Furthermore, partial discharge pulses are recorded as tree branches extend  from the initiating point toward the base plate. The branches may move upward as well as  downward in their continual path of least resistance toward the ground plane (McMahon, 1978;  and Mason, 1960). An example of electrical treeing is shown in figure 46, Electrical Treeing in  Plexiglass (author: Bert Hickman). In the figure, high voltage breakdown within a block of  plexiglass creates the beautiful fractal pattern known as a Lichtenberg figure. The branching  discharges ultimately become hairlike, but are thought to extend down to the molecular lever.  While extremely dangerous in high voltage insulation, the effect is often used to create works of  art as shown.   here are several types of treeing. Much activity has been given to water tree growth in utility  power cables in recent years. In addition, the chemical inclusions of sulfur and other debris have  been found to serve as initiators for treeing (Tabata et al., 1971; Dissado et al., 1988; and  Steennis and Kreuger, 1990).          n this section we discuss breakdown between insulated wires with respect to CIV and CEV. In  figures 47 to 50, we note that for all wire samples the CIV is larger than CEV, as expected. The  tests reported here were also used to study temperature effects on aging and a more detailed  description of test methodology is given in section 6.4.8.2 below. Twisted-pair insulated  conductors have a higher CEV than a single insulated conductor to a ground plane configuration,  as shown in figure 47, Corona Initiation and Extinction Voltages of Sample T1, Twisted Pair and  Wire-to-Ground Configuration Shown in Figure 11, as a Function of Pressure. An \u201cas-received\u201d  wire sample T1 was used in these data. For a twisted pair, there are two dielectrics in series with  the gas-filled space between the two insulations on the conductors. When gas breakdown  calculations were made, it was found that the effective gas-filled gap was approximately 10 to 30  percent larger between the twisted pair as compared to the insulated wire to ground plane.   across the wire insulation and the voltage across the gap between the wire insulation and the  ground plane. The insulation around the conductor has nearly constant thickness, but the gap  spacing between the solid dielectric and ground plane may vary from 0.017 cm to over 1 cm at             very low pressure as shown for samples P1 and R3. The CIV and CEV curves for these samples  are shown in figure 48, CIV and CEV Data for Sample P1 Type Wire, and figure 49, CIV and  CEV Data for Sample R3 Type Wire. When the pd dimension attempts to remain at the Paschen  minimum in the varying gap distance, the voltage across the solid dielectric decreases, reducing  the insulation effectiveness to a minor role, as shown in figures 48 and 49. The insulation  effectiveness is shown for test samples R2 in figure 50, CIV as a Function of Altitude (Pressure)  of Sample R2 Aged Several Hours at 304 \u00b0C. These data are obtained after 20-h thermal soak at  304 \u00b0C before testing at 288 \u00b0C.  Figure 47\u2014Corona Initiation and Extinction Voltages of Sample T1, Twisted Pair and  Wire-to-Ground Configuration Shown in Figure 11, as a Function of Pressure                 Figure 50\u2014CIV as a Function of Altitude (Pressure) of Sample R2 Aged  Several Hours at 304 \u00b0C              high-volume resistivity reduces heating of the dielectric. Values greater than 1012 \u2126-cm are  adequate for most power equipment. High-voltage insulation should have a volume resistivity  greater than 1014 \u2126-cm. Polyamides in high-voltage service should be operated at temperatures  lower than 200 \u00b0C, as suggested in figure 51, Volume Resistivity of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film at 1  kHz (Dunbar, 1988). Surface resistivity has to be greater than 109 \u2126 to prevent tracking and  surface flashover events. New insulations usually have surface resistivities greater than 1012 \u2126 at  23 \u00b0C and 50 percent RH. This value becomes much lower at higher humidity and temperature  values. If the surface resistivity is reduced from 109 \u2126 to 108 \u2126 by contamination, a significant  surface leakage current will flow. This will form a \u201cdry band\u201d on the surface of the dielectric. In  some cases, the dry band can be bridged by a small electrical discharge when the stress locally  exceeds the breakdown stress of air at the air-solid interface. Consequently, local heat from the  discharge will decompose the insulation and form a conducting path on the surface. With time,  the paths will propagate, forming a tree, and resulting in eventual breakdown (Chapman et al.,  1955).   breakdown in this report. Unfortunately, any sustained discharge will heat the gas locally  (around conductors) as well as in enclosed spaces (voids). The resulting temperature rise will  change the extinction voltage, thus giving inconsistent results. Therefore, the elapsed time  between CIV and CEV is critical to the accuracy of the test results. This effect has less impact in  the vicinity of the Paschen minimum. Readings at higher pressure-times-spacing values will be  influenced by temperature rise during test.                As an example, the impedance between asbestos-insulated nichrome as a function of temperature  and pressure in contaminated MoO3 gas is shown in figure 52, Impedance of Two-Conductor  Shielded Cable in Molybdenum Trioxide Vapor (Dunbar, 1966). The shunt impedance between  conductors poses a serious problem for thermocouple wires and instrumentation wiring inside a  braided stainless-steel shield.   hen testing for partial discharges in voids of solid dielectrics, internal temperature rise related  to sustained discharges affects CIV and CEV. When the walls of the void are heated by dielectric  losses, the insulation outgases, changing the gas pressure and possibly the gas mixture inside the  void. This affects the voltage difference between the CIV and CEV across a simple void in a  solid dielectric, resulting in test results that are not representative of operational conditions.  ging is the end result of chemical and physical changes in electrical materials or electrical  systems, resulting from the passage of time. There are several aging processes, such as thermal,  electrical, mechanical, radiation, and chemical. Both thermal cycling and chronological aging  diminish the dielectric and tensile strengths of dielectric materials and potted compounds. Most  early aging studies were performed using thermal stress as the prime degradation process where  a 10 \u00b0C temperature increase above nominal operating conditions for an electrical insulation  resulted in 50 percent decrease of life. Aging criteria were refined by the use of the chemical  theory of Arrhenius (Dakin et al., 1954), which describes the effects of temperature on the speed  of a chemical reaction. There are a number of excellent articles relating aging to temperature and  time (Dakin et al., 1954, and Hewitt and Dakin, 1963), and the article by Cooke (1983) shows  the changes in the slope of the Arrhenius plot with respect to several insulating materials.              Most manufacturers\u2019 data provides only the 1-min dielectric strength test results conducted at  23 \u00b0C and 60 Hz between 0.5-in.-diameter electrodes, telling little or nothing about the aging  characteristics of the material. Figure 53, Life as a Function of Voltage for Kapton\u00ae Type-H  Film (Dunbar, 1988), shows aging data for a polyethylene film exposed and unexposed to corona  at two different operating temperatures.   he characteristic life of a material can be evaluated as a function of temperature when data are  plotted as Arrhenius plots (figure 54, Heat Reduces the Time for Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film to Fall to  Half of Original Dielectric Strength). The baseline dielectric strength in figure 54 is 7000 V/mil,  for 1 in2 at 23 \u00b0C, 50 percent RH, and 60 Hz.    . When the statistically developed breakdown voltage of the withdrawn samples is 50  percent of the initial 1-min breakdown voltage, the end of life is assumed to be reached for the  specific sample at that temperature.                   Figure 54\u2014Heat Reduces the Time for Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film to Fall to Half of Original  Dielectric Strength  ife testing should be conducted at several temperatures to obtain significant, useful data.  Table 8 Life Field Stress (1 h) (Dunbar, 1988), shows the maximum field stresses for 1 h of  operation of three generic-type encapsulating materials. The lower values are for very thick  insulations. Higher values are for insulation less than 10 mil thick.  Table 8\u2014Life Field Stress (1 h)  MATERIALS MAXIMUM FIELD  Epoxies  Silastics  Urethanes  STRENGTH  (V/MIL)  200 to 350  300 to 600  250 to 500  ote that the data in table 8 are for 1 h life only, not 10,000 h. To obtain 10,000 h, the maximum  stress has to be decreased considerably. The voltage stress has to be decreased by 8 to 10 percent  for each order-of-magnitude increase in service life. For 10,000 h, the stress should be decreased  to about 65 percent of the values shown in table 8. Figure 55, Insulation Life as a Function of  Field Stress (Dunbar, 1988), can be used as a generic curve that may help in design work. This  curve shows the voltage stress in V per mil as a function of life. This generalized curve has  already included many insulation de-rating factors normal to electronic circuits. Not included are  frequency, temperatures greater than 85 \u00b0C, and units with volumes greater than 500 in3.              encapsulation, bonding, and voids. Use of the term \"void-free\" to describe an electrically  insulated set of electrodes does not imply the insulation is flawless; it means that the insulation is  free of any \u201csignificantly large\u201d voids. However, as time passes and insulation deteriorates, small  voids will increase in size, resulting in higher energy discharges and ultimately in insulation  failure.  nother life-degrading factor is frequency. Tests have shown that insulation life is inversely  proportion to the ac operating frequency. When frequency, temperature, and voltage stress de-  rating factors are all combined, insulation with a rating of 10,000 V for the 1-min test may be  reduced to less than a few hundred volts in operational application (Nelson, 1974; Morel et.  al.1980; and Montanari and Pattini, 1986). To further demonstrate the life temperature failure  rate, the Arrhenius plot of insulation life as a function of temperature is shown in figure 54.  rediction of material aging is an estimation of probabilities rather than an exact science,  because of material chemical composition variables as well as processing and workmanship  variables. Finally, there are the aging variables, such as environmental and electromechanical.  Therefore, it is readily seen that a simple formulation that may adequately determine the aging  quality of a specific material under a specific application may be in error for another material.  t became obvious to several researchers that partial discharges and corona degraded polymeric  materials much faster than temperature alone (Dakin et al., 1954; Hewitt and Dakin, 1963;  Cooke, 1983; Nelson, 1974; Morel et al., 1980; Montanari and Pattini, 1986; Montanari, 1990;  Dixon, 1990; Yianakopoulos et al., 1990; Cygan and Laghari, 1990; and Stone et al., 1992).   and models for materials aging under electrical, temperature, mechanical, radiation, and  chemical stress conditions were developed (Montanari, 1990; Dixon, 1990; Yianakopoulos, et  al., 1990; Cygan and Laghari, 1990; Stone, et al., 1992; Montanari, 1992; Khachen and Laghari,  1992; Densley, et al., 1993; Kimura, 1993; Simoni, et al.; Bruning and Campbell, 1993; Sanche,             1993; Li and Unsworth, 1994; Khachen and Laghari, 1994; Agarwal, 1995; Montanari, 1995;  Gulski and Krivda, 1995; and Dissado, et al., 1995).   important for the space industry to evaluate accelerated aging of materials for specialty  applications.    n general, insulation aging is accelerated at elevated temperatures. Aging effects due to  temperature were apparent in the study discussed in section 6.4.5. The test samples in this study  consisted of many identical specimens. Each sample type, such as R3 (figure 49), included 10  identical specimens for each temperature setting. One specimen was removed for test evaluation  following each 10 percent of total test time until 100 percent test time in thermal and temperature  cycling was achieved. The specimens removed were visually inspected; the corona was tested  and the sample was then preserved until the end of the test program. Thus, Sample P1 started  with 80 specimens for the 8 different temperatures. This accounts for a variation from specimen  to specimen related to physical dimension variations during wire manufacture and the  mechanical attachment to the corona test fixture.  amples R2 shown in figure 50 demonstrate corona test results following thermal aging. The  information from these data indicates that the CIV decreased somewhat as a function of thermal  cycling time. Indeed, one specimen had a melted spot on the insulation, giving it a lower partial  discharge reading at the higher temperatures. However, all the undamaged specimens were  visually and mechanically tested and passed. Within 20 percent of test time, the specimens at  both temperatures failed, and the CIV decreased. The visual test indicated a very roughened  surface. Following a mechanical wrap-unwrap test, many cracks were found along the full length  of the specimen, indicating failures.  insulation composition. Parameters for each material of the composite insulation system that are  to be considered are dielectric constant, volume resistivity, surface resistivity, and thickness. The  other parameters are conductor size, configuration, the environmental pressure, and temperature.  Insulated conductor configurations include coaxial, shielded, wire-to-ground plane, twisted pair,  and proximity to an adjacent conductor or ground plane. These parametric configurations are to  be carefully considered when designing interconnecting wiring.    he ac CIVs for many insulation compositions were also tested during the study referred to  above. The metal conductors were all the same diameter to obtain consistent results; however,  the insulation materials and processing for each test sample varied by manufacturer. Composite  and glass covered insulation systems differed but they appeared to have less variation in CIV as  shown in figure 56, Minimum CIV of Several Wire Types and Wire Sizes (Dunbar, 1966). The         single dielectric insulation systems, such as Teflon\u00ae-insulated wire, were not affected by the high  temperature.    differ somewhat from other test samples of similar composition because of supplier materials  and manufacturing processes. Samples with similar thickness were selected to show the effects  of dielectric constant when tested with ac. The dc applications are controlled by the volume and  surface resistivities rather than by dielectric constant.    thickness on the CIV/CEV. The greatest variance in insulation thickness was found for  composite insulation systems. Significant variances were observed because of the following  parameters: the number of Teflon\u00ae layers, the type of Teflon\u00ae insulations applied to the  conductor, and whether the insulations were applied as an outer cover or jacket, all of which led  to a wide variance in CEVs, as shown in figure 57, Minimum CIV as a Function of Insulation  Thickness.

Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 693-701.     he primary purpose of an electrical insulation is to isolate one conducting surface from another  and from their surroundings, restricting current flow to the conductors. Many insulation designs  have the additional functions of supporting the parts and structural components in their exact  position to eliminate electric field overstresses from vibration, shock, and structural  deformations. They also serve in efficient heat transfer from the parts to a thermal controlled  surface. High-power, high-voltage spacecraft equipment is densely packaged, and the denser the  packaging is, the more functions the electrical insulation is required to perform.   should be knowledgeable. The designer should know the mechanical, thermal, and electrical  properties of each material used in the potted circuit and should be aware of the compatability  between the materials associated with all parts, components, and structural members.  Encapsulating materials are critical to proper and reliable operation and aging of the electronic  circuits. They provide the electrical insulation between parts of different voltages and provide a  thermal path for transfer of heat from the heat-generating sources. Proper selection and  application of the encapsulating material is critical to the success of the manufacturer\u2019s design.                    Because improper selection or application are the source of many of problems, it is important  that the manufacturer has a thorough understanding of the encapsulating material and processing.  application and design. It is best to evaluate these processes for each application before a design  starts. One supplier may be a specialist in one material and processing, therefore this supplier  should be considered first. A study related to these issues can be found in Harper et al. (1979)  and Dunbar (1988).    complicated and difficult to use. They are best avoided unless absolutely necessary and have  been qualified to be used in specific applications. The materials used in Hughes/Northrop  Grumman (December 1995) are well defined and easily applied with minimum development by  materials engineers.  ome equipment is pressure sensitive and is designed to operate only at high vacuum, for  example, at pressures less than 1.33\uf0b410-3 N/m2 (1\uf0b410-5 Torr). Therefore, it is recommended that  pressure switches be installed in the flight vehicle to shut down the experiment at higher  pressures, that is, pressures greater than 1.33\uf0b410-3 N/m2 (1\uf0b410-5 Torr).  hen pressure sensors are installed near equipment containing gases other than air, the pressure  sensors may require calibration in a gaseous mixture similar to that anticipated in operation. For  instance, the continuous leakage of gas A and the purging of gas B and/or gas C may result in a  unique mixture, which may require the pressure sensors to be calibrated for that particular  gaseous mixture.  f operational requirements or test protocols permit, pressure-sensitive equipment should be  powered down whenever pressure approaches the Paschen minimum. Equipment that must  operate near the minimum should be carefully monitored and will need to be de-energized as  rapidly as possible if a pressure surge occurs. There should be a requirement that the pressure  sensors have inputs to the power system automatic control system, if one exists, so that the  pressure-sensitive equipment can be turned off in time to prevent permanent damage. Override  control circuitry should be installed to compensate for a failed pressure sensor circuit.   nstrumentation computer space, weight and volume restrictions, and system complexity restrict  the number of pressure sensors that may be installed inside the high-voltage instrumentation  compartment. First, the pressure sensors may be limited to the most sensitive circuit or  instrument. Second, the instrument should be essential either to the operation of the spacecraft or  an essential part of the mission objectives. The sensors may be placed next to the pressure-  sensitive instrument, in the instrument compartment, or near the instrument outgassing port  where external pressure can be sensed before compartment pressurization.               nsulation degradation related to aging occurs at all voltages, including the very low voltages  associated with solid-state devices. Water-induced corrosion, oxidation, and chemical reactions  all enhance the aging process of electrical insulation systems. More rapid degradation is caused  by over-voltage electrical stress, partial discharges, and corona usually associated with, but not  limited to, high voltage. Some properties of different voltage regimes are investigated in the  following paragraphs.    hen the appropriate conditions exist, corona can occur at any voltage level greater than the  ionization potential of the material. The 0 to 50 V region is usually considered corona-free for dc  voltages and low-frequency ac peak voltages (less than 500 MHz). This also assumes that the  environment temperature is less than 250 \u00b0C and free of concentrations of noble gases and  radioactive and other contaminants known to lower the CIV.   not exist, provided the following good workmanship practices are performed during design,  packaging, assembly, and test:                                           his voltage range is usually considered corona-free for dc voltages and sinusoidal ac peak  voltages with frequencies less than 50 kHz. This also assumes the ambient temperature is less  than 250 \u00b0C, and free of concentrations of noble gases and radioactive and other contaminants  known to lower the CIV.    hen the voltage stress in air is less than 50 V/mil (2000 V/mm), creepage and tracking should  not exist, provided the following workmanship practices are followed during design, packaging,  assembly, and test, in addition to the precautions stated for the 0 to 50 V ranges:                                       insulation is provided. Sharp bends and clamps can generate standing waves at high frequency  and result in breakdown.                                                                 Pressurizing with hermetic sealing or total encapsulation may be required for circuits that operate  at voltages above 5 kV and at pressures between 1\uf0b410-5 to 100 Torr (1\uf0b410-2 and 1\uf0b4104 Pa). A gas  with a high dielectric strength and large molecules, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), is  recommended to assure leak-free operation for long periods of time.             A summary chart for system voltages operating in air and other gases is shown in table 9, Power  System Voltages.

Encapsulation (potting) is defined as the immersion of all electrical  and structural components, circuits, and printed circuit boards into a liquid insulation, which,  when cured, forms a void-free solid insulation.    difficult to find.

Most published data need to be adjusted or translated for the application at  hand.  electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties that need to be considered for solid  insulation. Sometimes, solid potted insulation is specified to be transparent so that the packaging  engineer can assess parts stressing and bonding. Weight, water adsorption, and outgassing are  often specified. Most important for all categories of high-voltage insulation is life, which is  dependent upon the electrical stress and environment.

This includes the steady-state operating voltage as well as higher voltage transients, their  duration, and their frequency of repetition.   of construction, circuit boards are to be conformally coated to reduce breakage related to  vibration and shock, to inhibit corrosion and fungus during handling and storage, and to reduce  surface tracking along board surfaces between high-voltage and low-voltage parts, terminations,  or connections. Circuits selected for conformal coatings are to be either limited to low voltage,  installed within a module floating at high voltage, or only operate when the gas pressure  surrounding the board is less than 10-5 Torr. Conformal coatings are put on low- and high-voltage  circuits to prevent short circuits caused by conducting debris that sometimes appears after  launch. The parts on a circuit board are spaced so that the region outside the conformal coating is  quickly evacuated when the system is placed in a vacuum chamber or as the spacecraft is boosted  into orbit. Epoxy and polyurethane resins are the most frequently used materials for conformal  coating.  efore a board is conformally coated, it should be inspected. Flat surfaces mounted parallel to  the board surface should be staked 0.5 to 1.0 mm above the circuit board to allow the insulating  coating material to flow into the space between the parts and the board and fill the voids between  the parts and the board. Then, the following rules apply:  a. All boards, conductors, wiring, and electrical components are to be cleaned according  to the specification before the unit is conformally coated. This includes solder flux, fingerprints,  and particles from the work bench and dust.   a low-viscosity insulation. This is recommended to eliminate the pinholes (continuous leakage  path) and uncoated areas that normally occur in single- or double-coating processes. Application  of the dielectric material may be either by dipping or brushing with each layer applied at right                              angles to the preceding layer. The completed process should be checked with standard tests such  as resistivity or dielectric withstanding.   assembly. If wired, the wire and solder joints are to be cleaned and conformally coated with the  same precaution as the electrical networks on the printed circuit boards after the connections are  made to other boards and subassemblies within the module.  In some cases, a conformally coated board is then potted to attain better bonding. The board and  assembled parts are to be cleaned, and care taken to ensure good bonding at the conformal  coating and potting material interface. Some materials that are used for conformal coatings  include Conathane\u00ae CE 1155 and Arathane\u00ae 5750. Two materials that require a post-cure  vacuum bake to meet the outgassing specification are Hysol\u00ae PC 18M and Solathane\u00ae 113.   voltage areas. This can be accomplished by encapsulating the high-voltage circuitry.  Encapsulation provides the system with mechanical protection from external damage, gives  structural support to the components against shock and vibration, and protects the high-voltage  system from gas discharge damage.   in the subsequent hardware design. In this manner, a total system approach to the design can be  taken, yielding an electronic component with minimum problems that can arise from  encapsulation or potting. This will permit the optimum choice of components, parts, materials,  mechanical arrangements, manufacturing techniques, and the methods of functional and  environmental testing. This approach will reduce the failure probability. In a survey of U.S. Air  Force, NASA, and industry, encapsulated electronics failures fell into the following categories:  High electric stress (packaging); improper selection or use of parts (design); poor bonds, board  delamination (material); and voids, cracks, workmanship, and handling (processes). The  distribution of these failures is summarized in table 11, Summary of Failure Analysis Form  (Stinthal, 1982).

Conformally coated and pressurized circuits require large heavy  enclosures to ensure no leakage. Even then, excessive vibration and mechanical shock can cause  flaws in seals, causing the unit to depressurize, resulting in possible circuit failure.   cases. The workmanship involved during encapsulation should be scrutinized by visual and test  analysis to assure there are no cracks or voids in the finished product. Another aspect of  encapsulated circuits is the number and size of parts. Large volumes are more apt to have voids  and flaws than very small volumes. Materials matching is easier in a unit with a few parts than  when a large number of parts are used in the volume. Therefore, consideration should be given to  the use of encapsulated parts or circuits where necessary, while conformally coated parts and  circuits should be used for the remainder of the unit. Encapsulated parts and circuits should be  carefully considered whenever operating voltages may exceed the Paschen minimum.  Conformally coated circuits may be used for voltages less than 300 V in air, as long as the  circuits are in a debris-free environment.   ther environmental factors affecting insulation are UV radiation, nuclear radiation, and  exposure to solvents and chemicals. Addition of UV radiation and chemicals tends to lower  insulation breakdown voltage, either instantaneously or as exposure and deterioration progress.   ew packaging concepts are to be analyzed and evaluated for large high-voltage spacecraft  modules. In small spacecraft with loads up to 5 kW, solidly encapsulated modules, conformally  coated circuit boards, gas-pressurized modules, and a few liquid-filled modules have been used.  Most of the enclosed gas- and liquid-filled modules had volumes of less than 0.25 m3. Likewise,  most of the conformally coated high-voltage circuit boards operated at voltages less than 10 kV.  Some future high-voltage spacecraft components may require voltages of 50 to 100 kV with  volumes more than 1 m3. This will necessitate new and different packaging concepts, and there  will be reasons for using liquids or gases as insulating materials. These design solutions require  further careful analysis and considerations to prevent leakage and contamination of other  components.   noise. Typically, the noise signature is between 20 kHz and 20 MHz. If the partial discharges are  extensive, noise can also be induced in neighboring low-power level circuits. In high-frequency  systems such as radar, the wave shapes of the electrical signals can carry partial discharge  signals. Furthermore, these partial discharges produce ozone, optical emission, and acid from               oaxial cable shielding is often cured using intense electron beams. This is known under some  conditions to leave a strong charge in the shielding that can lead to unexpected breakdowns and  arcing later. Recent spacecraft anomalies have been attributed to subsequent insulation  breakdown and resulting arcing (Catani, 2007).  decomposition of material, which can cause deterioration of dielectrics. If corona persists for  several hours, the dielectric may start to deteriorate and eventually a breakdown will result.  nternal electrostatic discharge (IESD) results from charge buildup (from the radiation belts) in  cable insulation or in circuit boards (or on isolated insulators inside the spacecraft Faraday cage)  can cause serious arcing and permanent shorts. Designers need to be aware of such effects,  which are addressed in NASA-HDBK-4002A.  he pressure of gas between spaced electrodes in an electrostatic field is a parameter that is  required when determining the location of the Paschen minimum. This gas pressure between  electrodes may differ from the surrounding ambient gas pressure and may vary as a function of  time. With higher temperatures and mechanical stress, air trapped in the insulation layers may  rupture or force voids in the insulation when the surrounding air pressure is reduced. Figure  58(a) Outer Jacket Rupture and (b) Center Conductor Delamination (Dunbar 1988), shows such  voids created by gas trapped in layers near the center conductor and near the outer shield of a  coaxial cable.   ach electrical insulation material has maximum temperature limits and temperature-life limits.  Therefore, it is necessary to know the short-duration temperature and the continuous temperature  exposure, both ambient and local.                 n addition to the fill-gas between electrodes (such as air), there will be outgassing products of  the insulation and the conductor material. Therefore, the Paschen curves will deviate from the  known fill-gas curves, and should not be relied on exclusively.       initiation voltage for point-to-plane electrode configurations is affected by the polarity of the  point. The configuration with the point negative breaks down at a lower voltage. The ac initiation  voltage always corresponds to the lower value as determined by dc polarity experiments.  At high frequencies, the interference generated by partial discharges is worse than at low  frequencies. The rate of deterioration of insulation by partial discharges is usually proportional to  frequency. The dielectric strength of insulators is inversely proportional to frequency. Sample  values of loss of dielectric strength with frequency is shown in tables 5 and 6 in section 6.3.6.4.   he high-voltage insulation design starts with a circuit diagram showing all parts and their  anticipated design voltage levels. The parts are then arranged in a preliminary package, which  minimizes the net voltage between parts and voltage drop across each part. In designing  high-voltage assemblies, it is important to avoid wire and part crossovers that put a low-voltage  surface on one part next to a very high voltage surface of another part. Circuits containing  resistive or capacitive voltage dividers require careful design, especially if the resistor or resistor  string is extended. For example, a resistor or group of resistors may form a voltage divider  between the high-voltage terminal and local ground. The normal plan is to zigzag many resistors  from the high-voltage terminal to the ground terminal or to have one resistor with one end  attached to the high-voltage terminal and the other end grounded. Sometimes, other high-voltage  parts near the center of the resistor or resistor chain may be at full voltage or at ground potential,  stressing a zone that is not normally designed for voltage stress. This is poor design practice and  to be avoided.    electronic equipment and single-pin connectors between electronic packages and high-voltage  power supplies. Closely spaced, small-pin, multi-pin connectors are not recommended for high-              voltage unpressurized equipment, especially if there is a probability that the voltage between pins  will exceed 450 V-peak in the pressure region between 50 and 0.1 Pa.  simulated high-altitude chamber (Dunbar, 1974). Then, the CIV was measured between the pins.  Figure 59, Round Wire Connector (Dunbar, 1988) illustrates the pin construction and indicates  the air gaps of the test article. The tests were performed with the connector shell electrically  grounded and the connecting wires and unwired pins encapsulated with 1.25-mm silicone rubber  on each end of the connector. In the first test, a pair of 22-gauge, twisted, Teflon\u00ae-insulated  wires (0.025-mm-thick) were connected to adjacent connector pins and then fed through the  vacuum chamber wall to the corona test facility. The second test was like the first, except that the  wires were connected to nonadjacent pins. In the third test, one lead was disconnected from the  assigned pin and then reconnected to an adjacent pin on the other mating half of the connector to  eliminate the possibility of partial discharges between the parallel conductors.   insertion and extraction. To do this, small spaces surround each contact. Furthermore, small air  gaps will form about the wire insulation unless the insulation is pressed firmly against the  contact. Many connectors are made with spring-loaded or crimp contacts, which leave an air gap  above each contact as shown in figure 58. These air gaps are ideal for partial discharges, that is,  the air gaps are located in the highest field stress volumes.    he curves obtained from the test data are shown in figure 60, Connector\u201355 Pins in Air at  24 \uf0b0C\u2014Terminals Not Potted (Dunbar, 1988). The data show that the highest CIV was derived  from the test in which the pins were energized from opposite connector halves. In this test, the  initiation voltage for the connector was less than that of wires spaced 5 cm apart (the length of  the connector) and greater than that of twisted, closely spaced conductors. This low CIV  exhibited by the connector is related to air passages within the connector construction, as shown  in figure 59. The design voltage for this connector was too low, between pins, to provide  adequate high-voltage design practice. Curves for the other two tests have corona initiation  voltages equal to those of twisted insulated conductors (Dunbar, 1974).               onnectors are also to be designed to eliminate air voids between conducting surfaces. One  successful method for very high voltage (over 50 kV) applications is to make one side of the  mating-interface from soft, pliable insulation as shown in figure 61, High-Voltage Connector  (Dunbar, 1988). When mated, the pliable insulation conforms closely to the opposite dielectric.  The pliable insulation should first contact the molded insulation near the center conductor, and  then the contact should progress out to the shell without trapping air between the two contact  surfaces. A thin layer of silicone grease may be applied to the insulation surfaces of some  connectors to fill micro-pores in the insulation. Too much grease (more than 5 mil) tends to  prevent complete closure of the connector, introduce air cavities, or deform the pliable  insulation. Therefore, silicone or other additives are not recommended for properly constructed  high-voltage connectors. Commercial HV connectors are available, such as the successful and  widely used product line from Reynolds Industries that implement these principles.                  ome feedthroughs are designed with a shallow well around each termination or pin as shown in  figure 62, Connector Pin With Air Gap (Dunbar, 1988). These wells should be completely filled  with an encapsulant or provided with a generous opening for outgassing to space. The well, if  left open or partially filled with encapsulant, will be subject to partial discharges, even at low  voltages. The voltage across a bubble at the bottom of the well can be found by corona testing  the encapsulated article between each pin and the metal frame. The feedthrough insulator shown  in figure 63, Acceptable Stand-Off Connections (Dunbar, 1988), is an excellent design. It is  designed with corona shields on each end and has no air gaps between the conductor and metal  base plate.               pressurized on the other side. It should be remembered that the small spaces between the  conductor strands are like small air pipes. To be successful, it is required that the wire strands in  that section be filled completely with a potting compound or solder to work. It is best to use  solder with a solder ball or corona shield surface (Dunbar, 1988). The solder balls should be in  the center of the feedthrough. The potting material should be allowed to penetrate the conductor  ends to seal the insulation. Vented connectors should be avoided because they perform poorly  because of slow venting rates, thus resulting in a high probability of partial discharges.   ables for large high-power spacecraft may be required to operate at either high voltage or high  current or both, depending on the type of the power source and the load power requirements. The  design of the power distribution system will require that the line losses be kept to an acceptable  level without jeopardizing the thermal characteristics of the lines or subjecting them to arc-over  events.  istribution system mass is of prime importance to the design of large high-power spacecraft.  The mass of the distribution system includes the lines and interconnections and the required heat  rejection equipment (Finke, et al., 1978). That weight required for distribution wiring for dc or  single-phase ac circuits (in grams) can be calculated by the following equation:                    (or return) line. Since most of the larger spacecraft may be designed using high-resistivity  material such as graphite epoxy, a return line is necessary (return through structure may not be  feasible or desirable). This distribution system mass should be equal to or less than the weight  required for heat rejection. That weight required for heat rejection for the two conductors (in  grams) is given by the following equation:   is distribution line length in cm  A1 and A2 are cross sectional area of the conductor and the insulator, respectively, in cm2  D1 and D2 are the density of conductor and the insulator, respectively, in g/cm3    22  1      is distribution line current in A  \uf072 is line resistivity in \uf057-cm  l is distribution line length in cm  \uf061H is added conduction specific weight of the heat rejection system in (g/W)  A1 is the area per unit length in cm2/cm.  he mass of the heat rejection system depends on the shape and orientation of the conductors,  the operating temperature of the conductors, and the conductor material. Cylindrical conductors  present minimum surfaces for radiative cooling, whereas rectangular conductors present more  surface area for cooling. For simplified analysis, it will be assumed that the conductors will be  constructed from wide, thin, aluminum sheets, with the largest cross-section dimension oriented  toward free space. Aluminum sheet is an excellent material because it is lightweight, low cost,  has good mechanical strength, and can be easily fabricated. Other materials that may be used as  conductors are shown in table 12, Conductor Materials.

Several materials, for example, have lower density than  aluminum while lithium and sodium have much better resistivity-density characteristics. These  materials, along with beryllium and magnesium, are difficult to fabricate and require special  storage. Copper, silver, and silver alloys are heavier than aluminum but are much easier to join  and should be considered for the connector materials. Aluminum materials tend to crack and set  with time. Continual flexing (caused by electrical transients) could cause joints to weaken with  time. Graphite structural characteristics are such that it should not be considered for the ground  return; its resistivity is much higher than most metals.  igh-voltage interconnections between power supplies and electronic circuits are difficult to  design, assemble, and assess, especially if the interconnecting shielded wire is flexed or strained  after it is attached to one or both terminals. Linear stressing can break one or all of the bonded  joints between the shield, conductor, or wire insulation and the terminal and encapsulating  material. Any delamination at the insulation bond will form a void and can result in corona and  eventual voltage breakdown. When the wire is bent at the terminal (figure 63) and the high-  voltage conductor is flexed or stressed, there is a probability of delamination at the wire-  encapsulant surface.  he wire shield and insulation preparation are as important as the connection. One method of  preparing the wire termination is to cut the wire and shield to length and then place three or more  turns of a small conductor or formed metal ring over the end of the wire shield and insulator as  shown in figure 64, Wire Termination. This method holds the shield end strands in place and  forms a round conformal metal surface at the end of the shield. When three or more turns of wire  are used, as for breadboard demonstration, the wire should be soldered in place with a low-heat  iron as to avoid melting or deforming the insulation.              solder. This leaves the electrical post termination protruding through the solder on the circuit  interconnection. Often, the post terminal is clipped after soldering, leaving sharp edges  protruding above the circuit board\u2019s metal surface. This is unacceptable for circuits with voltage  exceeding 250 V-peak. Sketches of acceptable and unacceptable solder joints for high-voltage  circuits are shown in figure 65, Acceptable Solder Terminations, and figure 66, Unacceptable  Solder Terminations. Whenever a solder-draw or sharp edge protrudes from a circuit, the  probability of corona and voltage breakdown is enhanced. First, the conformal coating applied to  the circuit board and circuits may not cover the sharp point or edges. Second, solder has more  free electrons than a conformal coating. It can be assumed that a solder joint has corona initiation  and breakdown voltages of 85 percent that of steel (W.G. Dunbar, unpublished data). Third, any  ionization from a solder joint will result in surface heating of the solder, and the solder will tend  to evaporate a thin layer across the insulation surface between the conductors, resulting in  tracking and arc over. This phenomenon may occur within only a few minutes between high-  voltage conductors.                  smooth surface. Nickel-plated metals or steel are preferred, but other softer metals are often used  because they are easier to fabricate. The radius of curvature on all bends should be at least 2.5  times the conductor (tube) diameter to avoid flattening or crushing the tube at the bend. When  necessary, the ends of the tubes should be flattened as little as possible. The corona suppression  shield should extend over the edges of the flattened end, as shown in figure 67, High-Voltage  Lead and Bushing (Dunbar, 1988). Ample space should be provided between the inside surface  of the insulator (high-voltage bushing in figure 67) and the metal tube. A safe design would be  based on the assumption that the full voltage stress exists on the top edge of the bushing.      ollow tubing should be vented. Vent holes should be drilled through one wall of the tubing at  both ends of the tube. The vent hole should face the corona shield, and no other holes should be  drilled in the tubing.                   igh-voltage flexible lead termination should be designed to eliminate pressure points on the  terminal board (figure 68, High-Voltage Terminals (Dunbar, 1988)). Pressure points may cause  delamination and enhance internal tracking or corona. Also, the terminal should be protected  with a corona ball or shield.    ther insulation techniques include either burnishing or enameling over the knots in ties.  Otherwise, the feathered ends will become points from which corona discharges can emanate  (figure 69, High-Voltage Ties (Dunbar, 1988)).    Corners on Encapsulated Coils (Dunbar, 1988). Rounding the corners eliminates high stress  points or low utilization factors in the media between the encapsulated coil and its support frame.                    ccasionally, a voltage tap is required at the center of the part strings. This tap should be made  of material having the same diameter as the part surface and be thick enough for attachment of a  round tubular connection. Soldered joints should not be used because most soldered electrodes  have lower breakdown potentials than metals such as steel, nickel, brass, copper, and aluminum.  them. A potential shaping surface within a stack of series-connected diodes can be a thin plate of  metal provided with a large-radius edge as shown in figure 71, Curved Edge on High-Voltage  Plate (Dunbar, 1988). This curved edge suppresses corona.       designer may have to interconnect two or more components with a high-voltage flexible wire  that has insulation inadequate to sustain the full electrical stress of the applied voltage. This can  be done only if the following are observed:                     Generally, extra-flexible wire should be used only when the bending and placement of the tubing  through the high-voltage volume is too difficult or will mechanically stress parts during  installation. Terminations on extra-flexible wire will not stay in place as they will with solid  tubing. Therefore, the terminations are to be keyed either to a slot in the insulation barrier or to a  special locking device be developed for the termination and/or wire end.  measurements. These functions are performed with components such as fan motors, relays,  motor-driven switches, instrumentation, sensors, and circuits that operate at voltages less than  250 V-rms or V-dc. These devices and circuits, normally insulated, are incapable of withstanding  the induced transient voltages. Therefore, these circuits and their wiring must be well shielded.   ow-voltage devices and their wiring should be well separated from the high-voltage circuit  wiring. Low-voltage conductor shielding typically has rough surfaces that behave like multiple  points that enhance field gradients with respect to the high voltage. This will result in lowering  the breakdown voltage between high-voltage parts, or conductors, and the low-voltage shields.     sealed on the ends, will slowly depressurize at high altitude and arc from end to end along the  hollow-core surface.  The light blue coatings were well bonded to the elements. The dark blue coatings tended to  debond. The resulting air gaps then depressurized, and the resistors failed.   (MSFC-STD-531). This design is acceptable only if the gas voids are filled or potted with solid  insulations. Voids and gas-filled gaps will cause corona or breakdown and failure. If needed,  resistors should have conformal coating on their entire surface. The terminations will be coated  or encapsulated on the circuit board.                      ielectrics used for high-voltage capacitors include liquids, liquid-impregnated paper or film,  electrolytics, plastic film, paper-plastic combinations, mica, ceramics, glass, compressed gas, and  vacuum. Among these, liquid-impregnated paper or plastic film capacitors offer the best energy-  space-cost combination, unless special requirements with respect to temperature, stability,  radiation resistance, or packaging are involved. Consequently, they are more widely available as  high-voltage capacitors.  quite appropriate for low-voltage, high-performance capacitors used in solid-state  communication equipment are not applicable to high-voltage work and are not covered here.   and yields at acceptable failure rate. The dc capacitors for continuous duty also require a low  dissipation factor because some ac ripple is usually present. High insulation resistance is usually  required for applications. The dc energy storage capacitors require design features that permit  extremely high currents as well as very fast charge and discharge rates.    Series connection of sections necessitates careful attention to conductor insulation, clearances,  geometry, and workmanship, while the necessity for liquid impregnation requires meticulous  control of initial material purity, as well as prevention of contamination during processing.  performance at rated voltage. All papers and films have surface irregularities caused by wrinkles  and stretching that trap air when stacked between metal electrodes. Another advantage of liquid  impregnation is replacing air with higher dielectric strength liquid that results in a more compact  capacitor. Impregnation with solids such as waxes or resins is feasible for some applications.  Unimpregnated plastic film capacitors are also suitable for some applications but are usually  subject to partial discharge damage at ac voltages above 225 V-rms.  n addition to the requirements listed in table 13, Capacitor Requirements, high-voltage  capacitors should be selected that are made from dielectric materials having the highest available  dielectric strength and having the longest demonstrated life at rated stress.

These capacitors are intended for use  in high-temperature applications, similar to those served by hermetically sealed paper capacitors,  but where higher insulation resistance at the upper temperature limits is required.     high-temperature applications that require high insulation resistance, small capacitance change,  and low dielectric absorption. These capacitors exhibit excellent insulation resistance values at  high temperatures.  Dielectrics successfully used in high-voltage capacitors include, but are not limited to, the  materials shown in table 14, Acceptable Impregnates, and the following materials:           radiation resistance, but some interaction was observed between the DAP and K-F polymer  (Ramrus, 1980).

Likewise, qualification and acceptance specifications are usually interpreted and implemented  according to the requirements. In addition, acceptance testing may be limited to the measurement  of capacitance and to the complete characterization of the substrate and developed capacitor.  Substrates should be examined for cracks, delaminations, flaws, and voids using an acoustical  examination such as a Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscope (SLAM) or C-mode Scanning  Acoustic Microscope (C-SAM). This examination reveals manufacturing defects and may result  in an initial rejection rate that is high. Characterization tests for ceramic substrates include  capacitance (C), equivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent series inductance (ESL),  dissipation factor, DWV, physical dimensions and materials workmanship, vibration, and  accelerated life test. Temperature and voltage ratings should also be considered in design  selection, since capacitance characteristics can degrade with temperature and voltage variations.  eramic capacitors are made in a variety of styles and shapes, but the most commonly used  designs are variants of Multilayer Ceramic Chip (MLCC). Many designs now include metal  layers embedded in the dielectric between anode and cathode and floating electrode construction,  (called floating electrodes) that can offer significant performance advantages. Three examples of  plate arrangement are shown in figure 73, Relative Spacing (Stress) of X7R Dielectric Ceramic  Capacitors (Stinthal, 1982).      the greater the number of plates, the lower the electrical stress between plates. However, very  thin plates may result in more voids and cracks, which degrade the dielectric and lower the  reliability and aging for the capacitors as illustrated in figure 74, Capacitance Versus Applied  Voltage Data for 0.022 \uf06dF, 1000 V, X7R Ceramic Capacitors (Stinthal, 1982) where each data  point is an average of 10 to 12 capacitors.               Figure 74\u2014Capacitance Versus Applied Voltage Data for 0.022 \uf06dF,  1000 V, X7R Ceramic Capacitors           Reconstituted mica is ground mica mixed in a slurry to form very thin sheets of multilayer mica  chips. The resulting thin mica sheet is then bonded to a paper film resulting in a high dielectric  constant, high working voltage material with excellent aging characteristic. The drawback to the  process is the presence of a large quantity of microvoids and cracks in the mica slurry product.  Above the CIV, there will be a large number of partial discharge pulses. These partial discharge  pulses will have small magnitudes in microvoids and larger magnitudes in cracks and debonds.  For high quality capacitors, the partial discharge rate should not exceed 20 pC/s. Partial  discharges should be measured and baselined before and after thermal stress and vibration tests,  and should not increase more than 3 percent above the baseline for the component to be  acceptable.      dielectric thickness, and a large number of voids per square meter. When a paper film is oil or  liquid impregnated, the oil will fill the voids and wrinkles at the beginning of life, passing all the  acceptance criteria. Accelerated life testing usually causes some of the liquid to escape from the  wrinkles and large voids lowering the CIV and CEV and raising the partial discharge rate. As the  capacitors dry and partial discharges accumulate in the voids and wrinkles, the liquid will  polymerize, and hydrogen can replace air and significantly lower the CIV and CEV and increase  the partial discharge number and magnitudes. Tests for film capacitors are the same tests for  mica-paper capacitors.    Sometimes in spacecraft construction, live high-voltage circuits have to be switched on or off  using devices such as hard-vacuum tubes, thyratrons, silicon-controlled rectifiers, and vacuum  switches. The effect of switching on other circuit components such as resistors, capacitors,  wiring, magnetic devices, isolation transformers, electro-optical isolators, and triggering circuits  should be considered. Withstand voltages of such devices are typically rated for continuous  applications; however, the switching or impulse withstand of the devices may differ considerably  from the continuous rating. Boards, terminals, bushings, and other insulation should be impulse  tested.     haracteristics that should be evaluated by test include forward voltage drop (as a function of  current), reverse breakdown voltage, reverse leakage current, and reverse recovery time (t(rr)).  All tests should be done as a function of temperature over the operational range.           Of these parameters, the t(rr), is very important when selecting a diode for high-frequency  applications. A slow recovery time at the higher temperatures may lead to thermal runaway and  rapid aging. The other parameters are self-explanatory and should be judged by comparing  components with the same specified characteristics.   ransformers have several inherent failure modes that may be controlled by proper design,  material selection, and workmanship. Wire fatigue can be eliminated by placing a strain relief  curve at the terminating end of the wire at the anchor tap. In addition, the end of the wire to be  terminated should be stripped without damage by cutting, elongating, or bending the wire. Finally,  soldering the wire to the eyelet or to the termination post should be completed without excessive  solder wicking or using an over-heated soldering iron. The potting or conformal coating material is  to have characteristics compatible with the wire, the metal core, and the termination support  material. For HV transformers in particular, vacuum potting usually produces the best results.  Debonding of the insulation material from the wire, the core, or structure must be avoided as it will  result in either a crack or a void, which may eventually be a source of partial discharges and  accelerated aging.  coupling coefficients as a function of frequency and avoid mutual induced currents as a function  of frequency. Current sharing can be forced by interleafing the primaries and secondaries. This  will reduce hot spots within a winding and promote load sharing between transformer windings.  Since connecting multiple windings in series can result in very high voltages, one should  consider parallel primary windings on opposite legs of the transformer and, likewise, with the  secondary windings.    Curved and Square-Corner PWB Test Structures. Test results between curved and square-  cornered circuits in air and Freon\u00ae and with conformal coating indicate that, with the same  spacing between conductors, the curved circuits in air have 2 to 10 percent higher CIV and  breakdown voltage for spacing less than 30 mil and 15 to 30 percent higher CIV and voltage  breakdown for spacings greater than 60 mil as compared to square cornered ones. Freon\u00ae-  immersed printed circuit boards had an improvement of 5 to 10 times than that of air-insulated  circuits. Conformally coated printed circuit boards had 10 to 40 times higher breakdown voltage  and CIV than air-insulated circuits. However, a consideration that is not to be overlooked is the  workmanship and application of the coating material. Voids or incomplete filling and bonding to  the metal circuits will greatly reduce both CIV and breakdown voltage. Test results and  recommendations are available for a variety of epoxies rated for high voltage applications,  including testing for corona (Hughes/Northrop Grumman, December 1995). Materials and  conductor spacing should be compliant with IPC-2221A standard.                 from a few watts, in the case of smallsats, to several hundred megawatts needed for large  spacecraft using solar electric propulsion. The bonding and grounding of these units will vary  considerably. Smaller spacecraft with powered loads to 5 kW will use standard, single-point  grounding techniques with the solar arrays referenced to the central load module. Larger  spacecraft using multiple solar array sections, capable of being transported to space and  assembled there, may have a main load center and several remote load centers. Those spacecraft  will require special bonding and grounding considerations.      the plasma potential, depending on the plasma density, charged particle flux, and solar  illumination. To equalize the potentials, it is necessary to maintain continuous electrical paths  throughout the structure. Present spacecraft with composite structures already use conducting  coatings to alleviate the spacecraft\u2019s charging problem with reasonable success. The use of a           composite structure will change the nature of the spacecraft ground and complicate grounding  procedures. Concerns such as electrical continuity through the structure will become more  important whenever a composite joint is encountered. However, initial results with composite  spacecraft have indicated that composite joint designs are workable when properly grounded and  bonded. There is still a potential corrosion problem. The design criteria shown in table 15,  Recommendation in Designs Where Graphite/Epoxy is Coupled With Other Materials (Dunbar,  1988), have been suggested for composite/metallic joints in spacecraft (Brantley, 1978).

Six joint configurations (Dunbar, 1988) are shown in figure 76, Multiple Screen  Interleaved Lap Joint; figure 77, Multiple Exposed Screen, Mechanically Fastened Stepped Lap  Joint; figure 78, Butt, Scarf, and Stepped Lap Joints; figure 79, Mechanically-Fastened Joints;  figure 80, Metal Connector; and figure 81, Center Screen Stepped Lap Composite-to-Metal Joint.  etal connectors shown in figure 80 are recommended for large space structures. Although the  initial cost is high, the ease of fabrication in space may make this system the most cost effective.  The second best method is a screen technique shown in figure 77. The metal-filled epoxy joints,  mechanically fastened joints, and metal splices shown in figure 78, figure 79, and figure 80,  respectively, need much improvement or research and development before they can be  considered as applicable for assembly in space. An assessment of these configurations is shown  in table 16, Bonding/Grounding Concept Assessment (Dunbar, 1988).

The static drain path is necessary because the effect of vehicle charging  can be detrimental where the conducting sections of the vehicle are not bonded together. For  example, consider a vehicle that is charged triboelectrically on the forward surfaces and  discharged through corona or the plasma from the skirt at the edges. If the forward section is not  electrically connected to the aft section, charge acquired on the forward section cannot flow to  the aft section unless the potential difference between the sections becomes large enough for a  spark discharge to occur. These spark discharges can be quite energetic, since the capacitance  between the sections may be several thousand picofarads and the sparkover voltage may be  several kilovolts. Furthermore, the spark discharge will seek the easiest electrical path between           the sections. If there is some electrical wiring routed across this gap, it is possible that the spark  will travel through a shorter gap from the section to the wiring, through the wiring, and then  through another short spark gap to the aft section. This, of course, would put a tremendous noise  pulse on any data line. Also, there is the possibility that these spark discharges could fire  pyrotechnic devices.  he creation of high-voltage power supplies or any other high-voltage assembly or device falls  into two stages: the electrical/electronic design and layout/packaging/insulation buildup. The two  stages are intertwined, and both have to be kept in mind throughout the theoretical planning and  the practical hardware fabrication. Several examples of good high-voltage design are presented  in a report by Bever, et al (2006). Operational guidance for test and flight qualification of each  high-voltage power supply is also very important. An example of one such set of instructions is  included with the same report.    2006). High Voltage Power Supply Design Guide for Space. Report No. NASA/TP\u20142006-  214133.

The reasons for not testing high-voltage  electronics for partial discharges are varied. In many cases, industry does not recognize the value  of such testing as a means of demonstrating product reliability. Manufacturing economics often  influence this rationale.  t became evident early in the advent of developing high-voltage equipment for the electric  power utilities that corona and partial discharges shortened the life of the electrical insulation and  equipment. The first signs of such degradation led to the development of corona measuring  instrumentation. Today, it is almost mandatory to measure partial discharges in most electrical  utility power system equipment to identify and reject faulty materials and equipment. Similar                 types of testing should be required for certain space applications as well. This would ensure  normal aging of energized parts and materials without degradation caused by partial discharges.  Many of the practical testing techniques commonly employed are found in Bever et al. (2006)  and in MSFC-STD-531.   designed and calibrated in accordance with various national and international standards  organizations, for example, National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),  ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials), and SAE  International. While most offer some generic testing and calibration guidelines, the specifics of  equipment connection, calibration, and detection bandwidth selection are often left to the  relevant power apparatus committee or component manufacturer association guidelines to tailor  the testing to the application. Hence, the detection equipment options are typically focused upon  meeting the requirements of specific electrical power apparatus component tests, that is, rotating  machinery, utility high-voltage cable, and transformers and switchgear. As a corollary to this,  much commercial instrumentation is typically designed to test all equipment with energization  voltage at frequencies less than 1 kHz (including dc testing). In the case of electronic equipment  that can operate at frequencies in the 20 kHz to 500 kHz regime, partial discharge test equipment  has to be designed or customized to discriminate between the normal frequencies and the partial  discharge event. Erroneous conclusions can be drawn about the presence or absence of partial  discharges in a component if inappropriate detection equipment is used.  hrough the years, the recording and display of partial discharge data has progressed from a  direct visual display on an oscilloscope to digitization and storage of transient voltage pulses in  computer-based instrumentation. High-speed analog-to-digital converters that can record  multiple traces and aperiodic partial discharge data from dc testing (for later analysis) make this  type of instrumentation invaluable. Without it, dc partial discharge activity is extremely difficult  to quantify. This is particularly important to the testing of many high-voltage aerospace  components, which typically operate at dc potentials. Conversely, testing with ac voltage  generates partial discharge data, which are temporally more predictable and repeatable, than  testing with dc potentials. This is because of the periodic reversing of polarity on the test article,  which repeatedly charges and discharges the dielectric. Here, digital conversion and storage  instrumentation is also useful for accurate partial discharge activity characterization, but visual  display methods may be adequate.  t is the purpose of this section to point out some of the difficulties associated with utilizing  partial discharge test equipment designed for utility power apparatus applications to evaluate  aerospace electronic systems. This is not to say that such equipment is entirely unsuitable but  rather to make known the need for careful application and/or possible modification before to its  use in testing aerospace electronic equipment. Some problem areas fall into the following  categories:                    voltage surges that can apply higher voltages on turn-to-turn insulation in random-wound motors  and actuators.       less than 30 kHz. This is to eliminate electromagnetic noise generated in power system  equipment. Unfortunately, this can include the partial discharge bandwidth associated with low-  pressure discharges, that is, from about 0.001 to 2 Torr. In addition, the upper cut-off frequency  for certain wideband detection systems is often limited to a few megahertz. Many aerospace  high-frequency power conversion electronics may include switching circuitry that generates  considerable EMI in that frequency spectrum. Thus, partial discharge detection equipment  designed for commercial utility applications may require substantial modification of the  detection circuitry for aerospace equipment evaluations. As a minimum, equipment with  selectable or tunable detection bandwidth is required.    to the discharge source circuitry or placed near enough to it to electromagnetically couple the  discharge activity into the detection system. That is, the sensor should be placed in a position to  detect but not to perturb the electric fields and/or the operating characteristics of the test article.  In addition, an electromagnetically coupled sensor should be designed with sufficient sensitivity  so it can be located a convenient distance from the high-voltage conductors and parts in the test  circuit, such that shorting or arcing will not occur between the sensor and circuit parts.   the ground electrode. Instrumentation can be designed to sense the minute perturbations  generated by the passing of the discharge pulse current through the resistor. The transient voltage  signal is then passed through a transducer or isolation amplifier and displayed or recorded. This  circuit can be also used to evaluate the pd activity in electronic systems, which operate at high  frequency and/or high altitude.  n some instances, a resistor already exists between the circuit ground and system ground. A  specific criterion for the use of an existing resistor is that it be in series with the ground circuit              and that it not be bypassed by a filter. Some circuits utilize filter or shunt capacitors to reduce  EMI susceptibility.   electrical device used for measuring ac or high-speed current pulses (Wikipedia article,  \u201cRogowski Coil,\u201d 2013). These devices can be placed around a conductor in the test circuit, and  the output of the coil can be easily recorded and stored. The sensitivity of the Rogowski coil  (typically in volts/amp) must be selected for specific test purposes. The advantage of the  Rogowski coil is that it allows sampling of many different locations in a test circuit without  adding extra line resistance which, in many cases, will alter test results. The disadvantage of the  Rogowski coil is that it will not measure dc currents and it may not have enough sensitivity to  detect small partial discharge pulses. Within these limitations, the coils can work well in this  application.   The environment most likely to produce partial discharge activity ranges in vacuum pressure  from 10 Torr to 1 mTorr and there are many pressure sensor types that can be used to measure  the pressure in this range. However most of the sensors require insight into the response of the  pressure sensor in the current working gas, such as air. Many times this response limits the  ability to accurately measure the pressure at the lower and upper ends of the pressure range  which is the exact range where the tests must be carried out.   capacitance manometer is a pressure gauge that has been widely used to accurately measure  vacuum in the range of interest, independent of the working gas. The capacitance manometer has  been used in many tests and has proven to be a highly reliable instrument.   n UHF systems, gaseous breakdowns or glow discharges can develop and are sometimes  referred to as multipactor (see section 6.3.5). Such voltage breakdown (or multipactor) generally  only occurs at pressures less than 0.5 Pa (~4mTorr). UHF systems and components are usually  tested for voltage breakdown and for multipactor by input/output measurements or by VSWR  measurements. The presence of multipactor or voltage breakdown is measured as a change in  transmitted or reflected power (Chown, et al., 1970).  components and aerospace systems after installation has been completed. The presence of a  voltage breakdown or multipactor within a cavity or waveguide produces a very slight vibration  or audible noise. One technique is accomplished by attaching a very small accelerometer, strain  gauge, or other vibration sensor to the component\u2019s exterior. The vibrations generated by the  internal multipactor or voltage breakdown may be sensed. If a precise location of the breakdown  or multipactor is required, multiple vibration sensors may be used in a triangulation scheme. The                   other technique uses an external sonic detector to recognize noise generation in proximity to the  component. Of course, spatial resolution of the noise source is difficult.  ptical detectors have sensitivities compatible with the quantity of photons produced by the  discharges. Some of these detectors must be operated with little or no background illumination.  Most optical detectors are large, and may require fiber optic leads for direct optical viewing. This  implies that the detection of corona or glow discharges may be limited to the outer surface of the  test article. If the emission component of the discharge energy in the visible spectrum is large  enough, unaided visual corona detection is possible and certainly cost effective.   the UHF frequency band, can initiate very faint glows. A low-light-level camera or image  intensifier may be used to detect glow discharges, provided the test article can be tested in a  suitable darkened environment. One such application was on the SPEAR (He and Hall, 1984)  vehicle. In this example, the camera signals (pulsed discharge events) were passed through a  transducer, amplified, and transferred to the data bus system for transmission to Earth. This  technology may be very helpful when testing spacecraft high-voltage systems in enclosed  vacuum chambers.  till cameras can be used, assuming the still camera synchronization between the transient  discharge event and shutter speed is achieved or conditions are conducive to time exposure  techniques. This is less of an issue when the discharge is of long duration or a continual glow.  nother example of an optical device used to detect partial discharge in a vacuum chamber is an  infrared video system. The detection device uses specially developed cameras that sense only in  the infrared spectrum, that is, 2.5 microns to 25 microns. This optical device, when combined  with high-speed data acquisition, allows the digital monitoring of these test configurations many  times faster than a standard video system. The advantage of the infrared video camera is that it  allows the viewing of a pd in almost complete darkness. The infrared video camera has been  used successfully for monitoring and identifying the location of partial discharge events in many  tests.   photomultipliers, and curved plate analyzers, have inherent partial discharge detection capability.  The electronic circuitry associated with these instruments is much more sensitive than most  partial discharge instrumentation and can detect charge transfer quantities of less than 1 pC.  Therefore, any extraneous transient signals generated by partial discharge within their power  supplies or high-voltage electronic circuitry can be detected and displayed by the above  instruments when operated at full potential. The signals will appear either as dots and dashes on  visual displays or as spurious data in the signal record (Anderson and Kresge, 1957).                    simple and readily available electromagnetic-based device can be used for partial discharge  detection when only very qualitative information is needed. A small hand-held radio tuned to the  low end of the AM frequency spectrum (510 to 540 kHz) is one of the easiest tools to use to  detect significant, continuous partial discharge activity. The radio will pick up transmitted  signals from partial discharges as long as the radio antenna can be placed in close proximity and  oriented toward the partial discharge signal source(s) within the test article. The partial discharge  activity can be heard as a crackling or popping. This is possible since corona and partial  discharges radiate a very wide frequency spectrum, as shown in figure 20. However, the exact  location of the partial discharges cannot be determined by this method; only a general area in the  vicinity of the partial discharge site is discernable. (Note: This detection technique is usually  only applicable for equipment operated at pressures greater than 30 Torr.)    surface of a test article change temporally. It has been observed that the frequency spectrum of  such discharges in low-pressure air (0.1 to 2 Torr) is predominantly in the range of 10 to 30 kHz  (Woo, 1968a; Nanevicz and Hilbers, 1973; Densley, 1970; and Mason, 1978). Figure 21 shows a  specific case with parallel, #16 AWG, solid copper wire electrodes spaced 4.8 cm. in air at 0.75  Torr. This limited low-frequency spectrum is undetectable by the hand-held radio method and  some commercial partial discharge test equipment. A partial discharge test system with tunable  detection bandwidth can detect the glow discharge frequency spectrum. Input high-pass filters  may have to be modified or removed to detect the partial discharge frequency range at low  pressure.   detect the RF signals radiated from partial discharge generated within an electronic circuit or  system. When specialized antennas or probes are used, the test operator will be required to  position and orient the sensing device with respect to the partial discharge source to achieve  maximum coupling between the sensor antenna and the generated partial discharge activity.  However, the test operator should be aware that the partial discharge activity may be  superimposed on the circuit or system operating frequencies. In some cases, the test operator  may find it necessary to develop special filter circuits to attenuate normal operating frequencies  and harmonics so as not to affect the collection of partial discharge information. The available  partial discharge spectrum can then be optimized, amplified, displayed, and/or recorded for  future evaluation and analysis.   turns of insulated #22 AWG solid copper wire wound as an approximately 2-cm diameter  multiturn coil makes a simple RF pickup that can be maneuvered over the surface of an  electronic circuit. The coil output leads are then impedance matched to a transmission line and  connected to the detection amplifier. By attaching the coil to an insulating rod in the manner of a  wand, the operator can use the directional characteristic of the probe to locate the source of  partial discharge sites on an open assembly. The advantage of such a probe is that it can be  oriented in any direction and moved over the surface of the test article. This type probe has been           successfully used to determine the presence of partial discharges when assessing developmental  circuits and hardware.   limitation, which is its lack of absolute calibration. First, the distance between the partial  discharge activity and sensor detector is not fixed. Second, it is often difficult to introduce a  known calibrating signal into the electronic test article. Finally, the orientation of the probe with  respect to the plane of the partial discharge sources is unknown. Therefore, the antenna detection  system should be considered primarily qualitative.  hen it is necessary to quantify partial discharge activity, a capacitor-type sensor can be  developed (Bartnikas, 1979; and Ahmed et al., 1979). A capacitive sensor can be constructed  from a parallel plate capacitor geometry. The positive signal plate is positioned close to the test  article partial discharge source. To obtain a relative calibration, it will be necessary to inject a  calibration signal into the electronic circuitry under test.  t is intuitive that the synergism of different simultaneous detection methods may result in better  partial discharge detection with increased resolution. This has been used on high-frequency and  pulsed power components and subsystems. The following is an example describing the  simultaneous use of two different detection techniques. In this case, an improvised RF probe was  used while the circuitry was totally encapsulated in a dielectric media. The RF probe was placed  over the suspect circuit. When the RF probe could not be used, because the circuitry was in very  close proximity to a shield or ground plane, a very thin, small area (~2 cm2) capacitor was  utilized. The custom-developed capacitor was constructed from two conducting plates separated  by a thin film dielectric (with the outer plate grounded). The partial discharge signal was  transferred from the inner plate to the processing circuitry via a small diameter coaxial cable.  t is obvious that in some electronic circuits or systems the inherent background noise or EMI  may have a frequency bandwidth that includes the majority of the partial discharge frequency  spectrum. Thus, the use of band-pass or high-frequency cut-off filters to measure the partial  discharge activity selectively becomes impractical. Another effective technique may be to use a  spectrum analyzer to detect the presence of partial discharge activity within a circuit containing  EMI and natural operating frequency spectra. For this detection technique to be effective, it may  be necessary to operate the high-voltage electrical/electronic circuit at less than the rated voltage  to establish a spectral baseline. Typically, the baseline data should be taken at approximately half  of the rated voltage to be assured that the frequency spectrum displayed by the spectrum analyzer  is free of contribution from partial discharge activity. By increasing the voltage slowly to 75  percent, 100 percent, and finally to 115 percent or 125 percent operating voltage, individual  partial discharge spectral signatures can be observed and recorded. By comparing the output  frequency spectrum displays, the discharge inception voltage may be determined and/or the  partial discharge activity level can be characterized.              equipment testing and lab investigations (Meek and Craggs, 1978; Gill and von Engle, 1948; and  August and Chown, 1970). They are best suited for totally enclosed circuitry, which does not  lend itself to other detection schemes, by placing acoustic device(s) on the available component  surface. For example, electronic power conversion equipment that is totally encapsulated inside a  nonremovable shield box may be evaluated for partial discharges using acoustic emission  detectors (Boggs and Stone, 1982). Acoustic devices may be selected with resonant frequencies  from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. In the selection of these types of devices, one should consider the  specific electrical noise and operating frequency characteristics of the test article and avoid these  frequency ranges. The output of an acoustic detector is typically fed through an appropriate  preamp and filter into an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, or dedicated data acquisition system.     2006).
