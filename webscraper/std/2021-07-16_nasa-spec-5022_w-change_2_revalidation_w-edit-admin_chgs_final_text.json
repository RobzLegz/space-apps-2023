The NASA Technical Specification is a guide for design engineers to develop more  detailed requirements for specific pyrovalve applications. Adherence to these requirements will  reliably prevent NC parent metal valve leakage or other failure-induced release of hazardous  fluids (liquids or gases) from NASA payloads on Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs). This  NASA Technical Specification does not address NC parent metal valve sizing, pressure drop,  and other requirements.  programmatic documentation to ensure valves meet structural requirements and are considered to  be equivalent to other hazardous fluids pressure components such as tubing, tanks, and fittings,  and that any mode of external or internal leakage of the contained hazardous fluid is extremely  improbable (3 \u00d7 10-5) in accordance with NASA-STD-8719.24, NASA Expendable Launch  Vehicle Payload Safety Requirements, and AFSPCMAN 91-710, Air Force Space Command  Range Safety User Requirements Manual, or equivalent document for the applicable range.  ppendix A of this NASA Technical Specification presents a checklist of documents to be  prepared for NASA and/or Range Safety. The checklist is provided for manufacturers of NC  pyrovalves used in personnel hazardous applications. It is a tool for documenting the detailed  compliance to the intent of the safety specification. The checklist also provides an aid for  payload safety, Range Safety engineers, and other subject matter experts in reviewing the  documentation. Letter designations after the checklist item number refer to the following  requirement sources:                           For the purposes of this NASA Technical Specification, hazardous valve applications involve  hazardous flight hardware pressure systems as defined by NASA-STD-8719.24 and  AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 3, Chapter 12, Section 12.1.     as well as to valves that use a different means of applying force, e.g., memory shape alloys to  break out a section of a parent metal section allowing flow. The parent metal shear sections and  interface tubes are defined by the term \u201cparent metal\u201d when they are machined from a single,  certified bar of high-purity metal alloy with no welds.  This NASA Technical Specification is intended to be applied when these NC parent metal shear-  section valves are used to prevent failure-induced release of hazardous fluids (liquid or gas) from  spacecraft. It is primarily applicable to ELV payloads subject to NASA Payload Safety and  United States Air Force (USAF) Range Safety Requirements, where a consistently high level of  reliability and safety is required.  his NASA Technical Specification is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers and Facilities, and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program,  and other Agency documents. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally  Funded Research and Development Center [FFRDC]), other contractors, recipients of grants and  cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the extent specified or  referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.  erifiable requirement statements are designated by the acronym NCPR (Normally Closed  Pryovalves Requirement), numbered, and indicated by the word \u201cshall\u201d; this NASA Technical  Specification contains 80 requirements. Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in italics  beginning in section 4.

They also consume less electrical  power. They are single-use devices that are used in propulsion systems to isolate propellants or  pressurant gases. These fluids may be hazardous because of their toxicity, reactivity, temperature,  or high pressure.                  ote that in the simplified block diagram below not all detail features are shown so that those of  major interest are more prominent. The diagram is provided to point out the various features that  are discussed in this NASA Technical Specification. Features of some NC parent metal valve  designs may differ.   In 2013, NESC concluded an extensive study of the reliability and safety of NC parent metal  valves used in payloads carried aboard ELVs. The assessment successfully evaluated technical data  to determine the risk of NC parent metal valve leakage or inadvertent activation in ELV payloads. The  study resulted in numerous recommendations to ensure personnel and hardware/facility safety  during ground processing of ELV payloads. One of those recommendations was to establish a  NASA specification for NC parent metal valves. This NASA Technical Specification is a result of  that recommendation, which is documented in NESC-RP-10-00614.  .1.1 The documents listed in this section contain provisions that constitute requirements of  this NASA Technical Specification as cited in the text unless waived by the responsible  Technical Authority.

[NCPR 17] Each valve lot shall be qualified by meeting burst pressure test  requirements in accordance with section 4.3.1 in this NASA Technical Specification.          compliance with NASA-STD-5019 (see section 4.1 of this NASA Technical Specification),  growth of the maximum credible crack size shall be demonstrated to the fracture control  authority to be non-credible, based on knowledge of quality control and manufacturing  techniques used to make the NC parent metal valve.      metal barriers to the flow before valve actuation, this capability shall be verified by proof testing  at 1.5xMEOP, independently applied to each parent metal shear-section and then externally to                          b. [NCPR 28] All NC parent metal valves shall meet a minimum design burst pressure  of 2.5xMEOP for lines with diameters \u22653.8 cm (\u22651.5 in) or 4.0xMEOP for lines with diameters  <3.8 cm (<1.5 in).    2) [NCPR 30] Testing shall be performed before and after actuation and on a sample  of the units that have successfully functioned after destructive acceptance testing  (checklist items 8AD and 33D).  C parent metal used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage may be  required by USAF Range Safety and NASA Payload Safety to have a minimum design burst  pressure requirement of 4.0 times maximum ground working pressure (MGWP). NC parent  metal valves used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage are considered  Category A ordnance devices and have to follow NASA-STD 8719.24 and AFSPCMAN 91-710,  Volume 3, Chapter 13, or equivalent document for applicable range. This requirement should be  identified and documented early in the launch facility coordination process and be documented  in the tailoring agreement. This requirement would not apply to Category B ordnance pyrovalve  applications, which are, by definition, non-hazardous.       the shear-section when welded in the housing, with no evidence of permanent deformation or  leakage during LAT.                       Other shear-section barriers such as a metal-to-metal seal, elastomeric seats, or O-rings do not  provide the same level of confidence and do not meet the intent of this NASA Technical  Specification (checklist item 9A).     upon actuation of the valve. The shear-section normally has flanges larger than the shear-  section outer diameter that are welded to the valve housing to prevent leakage after actuation.  When installed in the system, the parent metal sections are directly welded to the system tubing  (checklist item 9A).     lthough many materials can be considered for the parent metal shear-section, the use of  vacuum furnace remelt 304L stainless steel has a significant legacy for the shear-section  application (checklist item 13D). (The L on 304L indicates extra-low-carbon stainless steel.)  Other metals may require heat treatment after welding, as judged necessary by the responsible  NASA materials specialist (checklist item 15D). The yield and tensile strength callouts may vary  depending on the strength requirements. The standard yield and tensile strength may be used if  they will meet the stress/force analysis requirements.       fatigue properties; low stress corrosion cracking; high elongation; and toughness  at cryogenic, ambient, and high temperatures (checklist item 14D), if applicable.    3) [NCPR 39] The parent metal shear-section and any other parts wetted by the  fluids and/or combustion products shall be constructed of a metal or other  material that is compatible with the fluids and/or combustion products.  The NASA Materials and Processes Technical Information System II (MAPTIS II),  a single-point source for materials properties for NASA and NASA-associated                  contractors and organizations, contains physical, mechanical, and environmental  properties for metallic and non-metallic materials.2 Other relevant resources for  materials properties are NASA-STD-6016, Standard Materials and Processes  Requirements for Spacecraft, AIAA SP-084-1999, Special Report: Fire,  Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety Hazards of Hypergols \u2013 Hydrazine; AIAA  SP-085-1999, Special Report: Fire, Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety  Hazards of Hypergols \u2013 Monomethylhydrazine; and AIAA SP-086-2001, Special  Report: Fire, Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety Hazards of Nitrogen  Tetroxide (checklist item 16D).  he parent metal shear-section may have stringers. Investigations have shown  that the stringers that may occur in 304L are usually approximately 0.00127 cm  (0.0005 in) in diameter and that the stringer material is not attacked by common  fuels and oxidizers over a period of several years. Even if the stringers are  oriented perpendicular to any thin break section, the chances of a leak from  stringers are remote. However, a commonly used dye-penetrant etchant (a  solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid) has been shown to dissolve stringer  material in 304L stainless steel. The solution attacks the material in the stringer  and can cause leaks in thin sections. This solution should be avoided on any part  of the valves (checklist item 17D). Note that for 304L stainless steel, any  significant stringer is screened out during the required proof and helium leak  testing process.  he use of vacuum remelt raw material significantly reduces the likelihood of  stringers occurring. Materials used in fracture-sensitive regions of the shear-  section valve should be derived from alloy production processes that implement  modern alloy remelting control practices, e.g., electroslag remelting, vacuum arc  remelting, or vacuum induction melting, which serve to enhance alloy  homogeneity, purity, and metallurgical soundness and reduce the potential for  undesirable secondary inclusion phases that can have a detrimental effect on  mechanical properties, fracture toughness, and pitting corrosion.      hazardous fluids after actuation, e.g., rams, plugs, seals, shall also have the same requirements  for materials compatibility with the hazardous fluids and the same welding compatibility  requirements (checklist item 18D).                Before firing, a leak in the upstream-side parent metal seal could allow hazardous fluid at  system pressure to enter the ram area. Similarly, after firing, leakage past the ram might occur.  In either case, hazardous fluid could enter the ram area. Therefore, to ensure at least single-fault  tolerance against external leakage, all internal valve materials that could then become wetted  are to be fully compatible with the hazardous fluid.  pecific mission requirements may drive other requirements that are not covered by this NASA  Technical Specification. For example, some applications require that the valve be in the system  and pressurized for many years with corrosive propellants after it operates, causing stress  corrosion or metal nitrate formation.   section design. This design is generally considered to contain two inhibits to flow and is the  preferred design approach.     Figure 3, Dual One-Piece Parent Metal Shear-Section Valve, is a design generally considered to  contain two independent barriers to flow (upstream and downstream \u201cV\u201d cut ligaments), but  additional NDE and/or analysis may be required to show that the single piece either does not  contain defects that may grow to leakage or that failure is not credible (extremely unlikely)  during ground processing operations. Both designs, when qualified, can be acceptable for use in  ELV payload hazardous flight applications (checklist item 20A).                             arent metal shear-section valves used in single isolation configurations (without additional  inhibits) need additional inspection and rigorous analysis to ensure the high unlikelihood that  critical flaws exist.   4.6.2  controlled storage as part of process control.  .6.3  [NCPR 47] For single isolation valves, a suitable and representative sample shall be  removed from the middle or ends of each bar and submitted to an accredited laboratory for  analysis.   nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid to remove 0.000762 to 0.00127 cm (0.0003 to 0.0005 in) from  the surface.     .6.1  manufacturing lot basis (checklist item 20A).                  .6.4  using the same tooling and machine setup for each lot of shear-sections (checklist item 24D).  hear-sections should be cleaned using the standard documented cleaning process for the  material (checklist item 24D).   .6.5  as specified by a cognizant materials and process authority (checklist item 25D).  . [NCPR 56] If applicable, the \u201cV\u201d notch angle, depth, and tip radius shall be measured  by optical comparator or equivalent and verified to fully meet drawing requirements and indicate  measured tip radius (checklist item 27D).    t is also recommended that the actual radius be documented to within measurement system  accuracy (within \u00b10.000635 cm (\u00b10.00025 in), traceable to a national standard). This will  facilitate valve analysis, if required.  a. [NCPR 55] Shear-section dimensions that are critical for containment of hazardous  fluids shall be 100 percent inspected and recorded for each shear-section (checklist item 26D).     .6.7  parent metal barrier conforms to the minimum thickness required by the design drawing  (checklist item 28AD).   established by NDE, proof testing, or process control if the valve does not meet or exceed a  demonstrated safety factor of 1.5.                    This NASA Technical Specification requires that the valve meet a demonstrated safety factor of  2.5 to 4.0, as applicable.   ye penetrants are generally used on flat surfaces (not in sharp groves), are not recommended,  and should not be used unless a well-documented probability of detection (POD) study has been  conducted to prove that the POD is greater than 90 percent with 95 percent confidence (termed  90/95 POD). Eddy current scanners with \u201cV\u201d-shaped sensor ends that ride in the groves are  commonly used for other similar applications such as detecting cracks in critical bolt threads,  and could be considered for this application as long as the technique has been fully validated.  Questions regarding validation should be addressed to the NASA NDE Technical Fellow.  .6.9  [NCPR 62] Etchant limitations: an etchant solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid or  other similar solutions that may dissolve stringers shall not be used internally or externally on the  parent metal shear-section.  .6.10 [NCPR 63] Valves shall be serialized and records of assembly production and inspection  steps kept by serial number (checklist item 29D).   a.
