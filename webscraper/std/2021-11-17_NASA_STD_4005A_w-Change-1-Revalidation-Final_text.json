The purpose of this NASA Technical Standard is to provide a design standard for spacecraft  electrical power systems using voltages greater than 55 volts that operate in the low Earth orbit  (LEO) plasma environment encountered in altitudes up to 2000 kilometers (km) and latitudes  between -50 and +50 degrees. Such power systems, particularly solar arrays, are the proximate  cause of spacecraft charging in LEO; and these systems can interact with this environment in a  number of ways that are potentially destructive to themselves as well as to the platform or  vehicle that has deployed them.  High-voltage systems are used in space for two primary reasons. The first reason is to save  launch weight. For the same power level, higher voltages enable use of smaller diameter wires  (lighter cabling). This is true because P = IV, and V = IR, so P = I2R (where P is power, I is  current, R is resistance, and V is voltage). If I is decreased by use of higher V, then smaller  wires can be used with no increase in power loss due to cabling. Of course, if one uses the same  cable mass, higher voltages will enable higher efficiencies, since less power will be lost to  resistance in the cables. For very large power systems, the decrease in cable mass can be  substantial.  The second reason to use a high voltage power system is that some spacecraft functions require  them. For example, electric propulsion uses voltages from about 300 V (Hall thrusters) to about  1000 V (ion thrusters). A low-voltage power system would require conversion of substantial  power to high voltages for these spacecraft functions to operate. The weight of the power  conversion systems, power management and distribution (PMAD), can be a substantial fraction  of the total power system weight in these cases. It is more efficient, and can save weight, if the  high-voltage functions can be directly powered from a high-voltage solar array. If the high-  voltage function is electric propulsion, such a system is called a direct-drive electric propulsion  system.  Because of these and other reasons, spacecraft designers and manufacturers are increasingly  employing high voltage power systems, but with the advantages comes a higher risk of  spacecraft charging. The presence of high voltage solar arrays and exposed electrical  conductors that carry high voltages can directly exacerbate the spacecraft charging process in  LEO, potentially resulting in undesirable electrical arcing, power drain and disruptions, and  contamination of spacecraft surfaces and coatings all of which contribute to the damage and                      loss of spacecraft coatings. Thus, system designers need a standard to show them how to  mitigate the spacecraft charging effects of using high voltages in LEO. In addition to system  designers, this document is useful to space mission personnel including project managers, solar  array designers, and system engineers.      his NASA Technical Standard is applicable to spacecraft electrical power systems using  voltages greater than 55 volts that operate in the LEO plasma environment encountered in  altitudes up to 2000 kilometers (km) and latitudes between -50 and +50 degrees. Specifically  excluded are spacecraft that encounter GEO charging conditions that do not (often) encounter  energetic electrons within the auroral ovals, and that do not fly through the Van Allen belts. For  the extreme radiation protection that is necessary for orbits in the Van Allen belts, exterior  spacecraft charging and internal charging will be a concern. However, it is not in the  purview of this document to deal with those two topics. For direction on designing spacecraft to  survive the conditions in GEO and in the Van Allen belts, one should reference NASA-HDBK-  4002A, Mitigating In-Space Charging Effects-A Guideline.  spacecraft. For example, in GEO one would use materials on the external surface of the  spacecraft with low electrical resistance that are all bonded together. This prevents external  charging and the potential for electrostatic discharge. In LEO, if you make external materials  conductive, then more current is collected from the plasma increasing the parasitic currents in the  system and changing the system floating potential. If the spacecraft will fly in both LEO and  GEO conditions, be careful to use design solutions that are applicable in both environmental  regimes (see NASA-HDBK-4002A).

SCR 5] Spacecraft that operate a significant amount of time in LEO shall use arc prevention and  mitigation techniques appropriate for the LEO environment. The techniques used to prevent and  mitigate arcing in LEO are not the same as those used to mitigate GEO arcing. For design  guidelines to prevent spacecraft charging in GEO, use NASA-HDBK-4002A.    a. [SCR 6] Solar array or power system trigger arcs shall be prevented using one or  more of the following methods (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.2.4.2):  (1) Limit the potential of possible arc-sites to a voltage lower than the trigger arc  threshold (which shall be determined by testing). This task can be achieved by  one or more of the following:  interconnects (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.1) or closely  spaced coverslides (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.4.1).     4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen discharge  conditions).                                    avoid creating Paschen discharge conditions. Elimination can be achieved by one  or more of the following:        dimensions than the minimum Debye length expected in the LEO environment  (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3.1).  2) Limit the differential potentials of adjacent solar array strings, cells, or power  traces to below the sustained arcing threshold (which shall be determined by  testing). This task can be achieved by using power system string voltages lower    b. [SCR 8] Sustained solar array arcs shall be prevented with one or more of the  following (but see also NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section D.2.4.2):                                   than the sustained arcing voltage threshold and/or using string layouts that  prevent adjacent cells or strings from having large differential voltages.         [SCR 9] The arcing thresholds for geometries intended to mitigate  sustained arcing shall be determined by testing.  (4) Prevent trigger arc plasmas from initiating Paschen discharge at the differential  voltage between strings or cells. The Paschen minimum for most materials that  can be evolved during a trigger arc can only be determined by testing. Without  an extensive test program to determine these thresholds, this technique can only  be implemented by using solar array materials that do not decompose under the  high heat of an arc. This excludes the use of Kapton\u00ae, certain adhesives, and  non-refractory metals in solar array construction.   (which shall be determined by testing). This goal can be achieved by one of the  following:         (6) Prevent arcs from extending in duration to milliseconds or more. This task can be  achieved by sensing arc occurrence and quickly (< 200 microsecond) open-  circuiting strings where arcs occur (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.2.4).  c. [SCR 10] Dielectric breakdown of structure surface coatings shall be prevented  with one or more of the following methods (but see also NASA-HDBK-4006,  Appendix D, section D.2.4.2):                                   dielectric strength of the coating. This limitation can be achieved by one of the  following:     interconnects (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.1) or closely  spaced coverslides (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.4.1).   4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen discharge  conditions).       surface potential is close to the underlying conductor potential (but be careful  that the capacitance across the coating does not become great enough to  exacerbate arc damage when arcs occur).   original dielectric breakdown (see above), or by preventing the spacecraft\u2019s  electron current collection from reaching the sustained arc threshold (which  shall be determined by testing) for the dielectric material. This task can be  achieved by one of the following methods:   be determined by testing, see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section  C.1.1.4.3).      C. Encapsulating all exposed electron collecting conductors, or by other  techniques for limiting electron current collection (see below).                               (1) Keep potentials of exposed conductors below the Paschen minimum for all  ambient and emitted gases (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.1). This can be achieved by one or all of the following methods:  . Encapsulating exposed electron-collecting conductors (be careful not  to create Paschen discharge conditions below the encapsulation).    (2) Prevent the neutral pressure from entering the Paschen regime for the  spacecraft plasma sheath dimensions. This task can be achieved by the  following methods:                                                                (2) Prevent arc currents from traversing the human body or other circuits sensitive to  power surges. This task can be achieved by using sneak-circuit analysis to make  sure astronauts or sensitive circuits are not in the direct path of current flow  during an arc.   can be achieved by preventing the arc from becoming a sustained arc (see  above).     limitation can be achieved by preventing dielectric breakdown or solar array  arcing on surfaces that are used for thermal control, optical surfaces, possible  electromagnetic interference (EMI)-radiating surfaces, electronics enclosures,  and the like. See above for techniques to prevent dielectric breakdown and/or  solar array arcing on these surfaces. Arcs on surfaces that are not critical to  spacecraft systems and will not contaminate sensitive surfaces nor radiate into  sensitive electronics do not require arc prevention.      .1.7.1  General LEO Standard Requirements shall always be verified by testing.    .1.7.2  and/or large parasitic plasma currents shall never be attempted solely by analysis. No substitute  exists for testing in a simulated LEO environment under simulated (worst-case) operational  conditions. Test the particular design, have a knowledgeable spacecraft electrostatic discharge  (ESD) engineer review the design at the earliest possible stage in the program, and ensure  continuing support is provided through launch. (See NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix F, for  appropriate test conditions.)                 ue to the complexity and uniqueness of space flight, it is unlikely that all of the requirements in a NASA technical standard will  apply.
