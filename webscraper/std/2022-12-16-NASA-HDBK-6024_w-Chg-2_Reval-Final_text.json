Generally, atomic oxygen erosion is measured in terms of mass loss per  area but can also be measured as thickness loss through recession.           nowing the density of a polymer, its mass loss, and the number of oxygen atoms that have  arrived, the atomic oxygen erosion yield can then be calculated based on mass loss. The term  erosion yield does not have meaning for polymers or materials that have nonvolatile oxidation  products. For such materials, such as silicones, there may be degradation by oxidation without  significant change in mass.     mass fraction ash in the material  surface area of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample

flexibility and low density, as well as  desirable electrical, thermal, and optical properties. Materials used on the exterior of spacecraft  are subjected to many environmental threats that can cause degradation. In LEO, these threats  include photon radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation, x-rays,  solar wind particle radiation (electrons, protons), temperature effects and thermal cycling,  impacts from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD), spacecraft self-contamination, and  atomic oxygen. While all of these environmental exposures can cause serious degradation to  spacecraft components, atomic oxygen is a particularly serious structural, thermal, and optical  threat, especially to exterior polymeric spacecraft components. An example of the complete loss  of a Kapton\uf0d2 H (a DuPont\u2122 polyimide derived from pyromellitic acid dianhydride (PMDA) and  4,4\u2019-oxydianiline (ODA)) thermal blanket insulation layer, as well as degradation of other  polymeric materials caused by atomic oxygen erosion in LEO, is provided in by O\u2019Neal et al.

The objective of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to accurately determine  the atomic oxygen erosion yields of a wide variety of polymeric materials exposed for an                 extended period of time to the LEO space environment. The polymers range from those  commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, to more recently developed  polymers, such as high-temperature polyimide polymerization of monomer reactants (PMR).  Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical  composition. Error analyses were conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield values for  each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight samples. This NASA Technical Handbook  provides details on the specific polymers flown, flight sample fabrication, pre-flight and post-  flight characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen fluence calculations, along with a  summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results and the corresponding erosion yield error  analyses.  lso included are ground-laboratory to in-space correlation data for the PEACE polymers in an  RF plasma asher, an atomic oxygen erosion yield predictive tool that was developed based on the  MISSE 2 PEACE flight data, tools for using atomic oxygen erosion yield data for spacecraft  durability applications, and lessons learned on the environment durability of spacecraft materials  from spaceflight experiments.   al., 1965). In NASA-TM-X-74335, U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976, NASA, the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Air Force (USAF)  documented that atomic oxygen and its related reactions with materials exist in space. However,  the damaging effects of atomic oxygen on spacecraft materials were not recognized until the  Space Shuttle began flying missions in LEO. Although definitions vary greatly, according to one  source, LEO is considered to be satellite orbits between about 140 and 970 km above the surface  of Earth (low earth orbit, n.d. in Merriam-Webster). Early in-space observation that the residual  atmosphere was interacting with spacecraft surfaces came in part as a result of comparison of  day and night pictures of the Space Shuttle, as shown in Figure 2, Space Shuttle with the Bay  Oriented in the Direction of Travel (Ram Direction), where the glow from de-excitation atoms  and molecules leaving Shuttle surfaces oriented in the ram (forward-facing) direction are visible  in the night image (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA; Mende, 1984).     (b) Time-Lapsed Image Taken at Night with  \u201cShuttle Glow\u201d Visible                observations of increases in the diffuse reflectance of polymers related to surface texturing.  Specifically, after the first Shuttle mission (Space Transportation System (STS)-1) returned to  Earth, engineers examining materials surfaces in the payload bay found that exterior Kapton\uf0d2  television camera thermal blankets had been altered during flight from a glossy amber color to a  flat, milky yellow color (Leger, 1982; Leger, 1983). This was originally thought to be the result  of contamination, but high-resolution electron microscopy examination revealed a recessed,  carpet-like texture with a directional pattern associated with the vehicle velocity direction. It was  concluded that degradation was caused by oxidation of organic materials through high-velocity  collision with atmospheric atomic oxygen, resulting in volatile reaction products (carbon dioxide  (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), etc.,) that resulted in erosion and mass loss (Leger,  1982; Leger, 1983).   urther tests documented the rate of atomic oxygen erosion of commonly used spacecraft  polymers. The first dedicated atomic oxygen experiment was proposed for flight on STS-5 to  provide quantitative data on atomic oxygen reaction rates of materials. The reaction rate, given in  volume loss per incident oxygen atom (cm3/atom), is known as the atomic oxygen erosion yield.  This experiment was called the Effects of Oxygen Interactions with Materials I (Visentine et al.,  1985; Silverman, 1995, Part 1) or the Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions with Materials I, both  abbreviated as EOIM I. Many additional materials spaceflight experiments have since been  flown to assess atomic oxygen durability. The knowledge gained from these experiments of  atomic oxygen erosion of commonly used spacecraft materials has led to modifications in  spacecraft design in efforts to increase spacecraft durability in the LEO atomic oxygen  environment.   (O2). Short wavelength (\uf03c243 nm) solar radiation has sufficient energy to break the 5.12-eV O2  diatomic bond (Dickerson et al., 1979) in an environment where the mean free path is  sufficiently long (~108 m) that the probability of re-association or the formation of ozone (O3) is  small. Between the altitudes of 180 and 650 km, atomic oxygen is the most abundant species, as  shown in Figure 3, Density of Atmospheric Species as a Function of Altitude, from NASA-TM-  X-74-335 (NOAA 1976). This Figure and the data plotted in Figure 4, Atomic Oxygen Number  Density versus Altitude for Solar Minimum, Nominal (Standard Atmosphere), and Solar  Maximum Conditions, Figure 5, Atomic Oxygen Fluence per Year during a Solar Cycle, Figure  6, Average Molecular Weight as a Function of Altitude, and Figure 7, Kinetic Temperature of  LEO Atomic Oxygen as a Function of Altitude, show general trends. More accurate and recent  values can be obtained from Picone et al., (2002) and from the NASA Marshall Space Flight  Center\u2019s (MSFC\u2019s) solar activity website1. Although excited states of atomic oxygen can be  formed, their lifetimes are sufficiently short that the triple P (3P) ground state dominates the LEO  atomic oxygen formation and is dependent upon the O2 density and solar UV flux. Solar heating  of Earth\u2019s atmosphere from VUV radiation causes an increase in the number density of atoms at              a given altitude as Earth rotates from sunrise toward solar noon. Because the thermosphere  rotates with Earth, the solar-heated bulge in the atmosphere is pushed forward such that the peak  of the atomic oxygen density occurs in the late afternoon rather than at solar noon. As a  consequence, anti-solar-facing surfaces, such as the back side of solar arrays, receive 25 percent  more atomic oxygen fluence than the solar-facing surfaces as the spacecraft orbits Earth (Banks  et al., 1991).   change the atomic oxygen production rate and, therefore, the arriving flux on spacecraft surfaces.  Periods of high and low solar activity can change the arriving flux by several orders of  magnitude depending on altitude (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA2). (See Figure 4.) Because of this  uncertainty in solar activity, the atomic oxygen flux cannot be predicted accurately over short  durations of time. The average atomic oxygen number density varies as a result of the solar  activity consistent with the 11-year sunspot cycle (Hedin, 1987). (See Figure 5.) The Mass  Spectrometer-Incoherent Scattered-86 (MSIS-86) atmospheric model takes into account the  variation in number density with the 11-year solar cycle, and hence, the atomic oxygen flux and  fluence vary with the solar cycle (Hedin, 1987). Atomic oxygen can also be produced in other  planetary environments, such as the Mars orbital environment, where oxygen is present.

If the spacecraft is in an orbit that has  0\u00b0 inclination, then the average angle of attack of the atomic oxygen is perpendicular to surfaces  whose surface normal vector points in the direction of travel. However, most spacecraft have  orbits that are inclined with respect to Earth\u2019s equatorial plane. This causes the average angle of  attack of the arriving atomic oxygen to vary sinusoidally around the orbit as a result of the  vectoral contributions from the orbital spacecraft velocity vector and the atmosphere\u2019s co-  rotation velocity vector (de Groh and Banks, 1994). Because the co-rotation velocity vector is in  approximately the same direction as the orbital velocity vector, the actual oxygen atom impact  energy is slightly lower than what would be predicted based on the orbital velocity alone. In  addition, atomic oxygen atoms have thermal velocities associated with their Maxwell-Boltzman  velocity distribution at the high temperatures of LEO, typically around 1000 K (NASA-TM-  X-74335). The high-velocity tail of the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution actually allows a very  small fraction of the atomic oxygen atoms to catch up with the trailing surfaces of a LEO  spacecraft to produce a small flux that is orders of magnitude lower than the ram flux. Thus, the  thermal velocities of the atomic oxygen associated with their Maxwell-Boltzman velocity  distribution contribute as an additional vectoral component to the overall impact velocity of the  atomic oxygen, which results in an angular distribution of arrival directions.     f the three vectoral components are summed and averaged over a typical 400-km orbit at  28.5\uf0b0 inclination, the angular distribution of arriving atoms is as shown in Figure 8, Atomic  Oxygen Arrival Flux Relative to the Ram Direction for a 400-km Orbit at 28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and  1000-K Thermosphere, where the arrival distribution in the horizontal plane is shown as a               function of incidence angle for surfaces normal to the ram direction (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA).  The flux is plotted relative to the normal incident flux.  Figure 8\u2014Atomic Oxygen Arrival Flux Relative to the Ram Direction for a 400-km Orbit  at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere  Atomic oxygen can arrive at angles beyond 90\uf0b0 from the orbital direction. For example, Figure 9,  Polar Plot of Relative Atomic Oxygen Flux as a Function of the Angle between the Ram  Direction and the Normal of the Arrival Surface for a LEO Spacecraft in a 400-km Orbit at  28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere, shows that a surface whose normal is 98\uf0b0 with  respect to the ram direction receives approximately 4 percent of the flux that occurs for a surface  whose normal is parallel to the ram direction (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA). Note that, for angles  significantly off-normal incidence, Figure 9 provides a more accurate representation of the flux  than does Figure 8.                   Figure 9\u2014Polar Plot of Relative Atomic Oxygen Flux as a Function of the Angle between  the Ram Direction and the Normal of the Arrival Surface for a LEO Spacecraft in a 400-  km Orbit at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere  The flux of atomic oxygen at ISS altitudes is approximately 5.23\uf0b41013 atoms/cm2\u2219sec for normal  incident ram surfaces (at 400-km altitude averaged over the 11-year solar cycle) (Banks et al.,  1990). At ISS altitudes, the atomic oxygen fluence for a 15-year mission (averaged over the  variations with solar cycle) is approximately 4.5\uf0b41022 atoms/cm2. This was computed for a  15-year mission starting with the first ISS element launch (Zarya) on November 20, 1998,  assuming an altitude of 348 km, using Environmental WorkBench software. This fluence level is  high enough to cause significant degradation to a number of susceptible spacecraft materials,  posing a significant potential threat to the durability of long-duration spacecraft systems.   is often more useful to look at a more detailed plot in the region near tangential arrival, such as  for the LDEF spacecraft orbit, as shown in Figure 10, Atomic Oxygen Flux Relative to the Ram  Direction as a Function of Angle from the Ram Direction for the LDEF Spacecraft, (with data  for Figure 10 provided in Table 1, Numerical Values of Atomic Oxygen Flux Relative to the  Ram Direction as a Function of Angle from the Ram Direction for the LDEF Spacecraft)  (Bourassa and Gillis, 1991). As can be seen in Table 1, at 90\uf0b0 from the ram direction, the atomic  oxygen flux is 4.15 percent that for the ram direction. This relative flux also depends slightly on  the orbital inclination and on whether the surface is facing in an Earth-radial or Earth-tangential  direction because of vectoral contributions caused by the co-rotation of the thermosphere.

As can be seen in Figure  11, Energy Distribution of Atomic Oxygen Atoms as a Function of Altitude for a Circular Orbit  at 28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere, the average impact energy is 4.5 (\uf0b11) eV for a  400-km orbit, and the impact energy decreases with altitude (Banks, 2004, AIAA).        Figure 11\u2014Energy Distribution of Atomic Oxygen Atoms as a Function of Altitude for a  Circular Orbit at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1,000-K Thermosphere   a LEO spacecraft travels through the part of its orbit that is the closest distance to Earth, it has  the highest velocity relative to the atomic oxygen in the residual atmosphere of Earth, i.e., it  travels faster than it does when it is farther from Earth. Therefore, for the low-altitude duration of  the spacecraft\u2019s orbit, the ram energy of impacting atomic oxygen is higher than it is during the  rest of the orbit (and also than it would be in a typical circular LEO orbit). Although erosion  yield dependence on ram energy has not been accurately measured for most polymers, there is  general agreement that erosion yield increases as ram energy increases.  oxygen flux at the perigee of its orbit. Figure 12, Elliptical Orbit Definition of Perigee, Apogee,  Earth Radius, and Orbital Velocity, shows the orbital parameters perigee (RP), apogee (RA), Earth  radius (RE), and orbital velocity at perigee (VP). A spacecraft in elliptical orbit can ultimately                  accumulate a very high atomic oxygen fluence if the perigee is low and the mission is of a long  duration. If this is the case, then spacecraft in highly elliptical orbits with low perigees could  experience significant erosion of organic materials on lengthy missions because of a combination  of increased ram energy and increased fluence of impacting atomic oxygen.  Figure 12\u2014Elliptical Orbit Definition of Perigee, Apogee, Earth Radius, and Orbital  Velocity  Subtracting Earth\u2019s atmospheric co-rotation velocity from the equatorial orbital velocity of a  spacecraft at perigee yields the highest ram energy (the energy at perigee) (EPE) for equatorial  orbits:    Altitude for Equatorial Elliptical Orbits, as expected, the maximum ram energy increases as  apogee altitude increases and decreases as perigee altitude increases.

This is primarily because most prior missions  occupied high-altitude orbits, where atomic oxygen densities are inconsequential.      orbital velocity. These include chemical reaction with surface molecules, elastic scattering,  scattering with partial or full thermal accommodation, and recombination or excitation of ram  species (Gregory, 1986). Atomic oxygen can react with polymers, carbon, and many metals to  form oxygen bonds with atoms on the exposed surface. For most polymers, hydrogen  abstraction, oxygen addition, or oxygen insertion can occur (Dever, 1991; Dever, 2005), as  shown in Figure 14, Atomic Oxygen Reaction Pathways with Polymers. With continued atomic  oxygen exposure, all oxygen interaction pathways eventually lead to volatile oxidation products.  This results in gradual erosion of hydrocarbon or halocarbon material, with the exception of  silicone materials. The amount of erosion of a hydrocarbon or halocarbon material that is  acceptable depends on the material\u2019s function and functional performance requirements and on  the associated margins and factors of safety relevant to the specific material and mission.               example is provided in Figure 15, Surface Oxygen Content of CTFE as a Function of Atomic  Oxygen in an RF Plasma Asher, where the surface oxygen content, measured using x-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as a function of atomic oxygen exposure level is provided for  chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) exposed to atomic oxygen in an RF air plasma asher (Mata et al.,  2003).            Figure 15\u2014Surface Oxygen Content of CTFE as a Function of Atomic Oxygen in an RF  Plasma Asher  Silicones, a family of commonly used spacecraft materials, are an exception to polymeric  materials that erode away with atomic oxygen exposure. With atomic oxygen exposure,  oxidation reactions cause the surface of silicones to oxidize and volatilize their hydrocarbon  content and convert to a hardened silica-based surface layer, which is resistant to atomic oxygen  erosion (de Groh et al., 2006, JSR). In this oxidation and volatilization process, silicones tend to  form a surface that is under tension relative to the underlying polymer. Eventually, with  sufficient fluence, the surfaces can form microscopic mud-tile-like cracks. A sample flown as  part of the Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions with Materials III (EOIM III) provides an example  of mud-tile cracking in response to exposure to a low fluence of atomic oxygen in LEO (de Groh  and McCollum, 1995). (See Figure 16, DC 93-500 Silicone Exposed to LEO Atomic Oxygen as  Part of the EOIM III Shuttle Experiment.)3 This sample was exposed to an atomic oxygen  fluence of 2.3\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2 during STS-46. Even with volatilization of hydrocarbons,  silicones often do not lose mass (Hung and Cantrell, 1994), and some silicones actually gain  mass during atomic oxygen exposure. Therefore, the atomic oxygen durability of silicones  should not be based on erosion, as with other spacecraft polymers. Another consequence of  atomic oxygen interaction with some silicones is the production of dark contamination on  neighboring surfaces in LEO, particularly with UV exposure (Banks et al., 2000; de Groh and  McCue, 1999).                 (b) Post-Flight with Mud-Tile Cracking  Observed  Figure 16\u2014DC 93-500 Silicone Exposed to LEO Atomic Oxygen as Part of the EOIM III  Shuttle Experiment  that are oriented in a fixed position with respect to the ram direction gradually develop left-  standing cones that point in the direction of arriving atomic oxygen. Thus, the microscopic  roughness of the surfaces increases with time. Because the erosion of one location is independent  of any other location and because the atomic oxygen arrives at microscopically random locations  on the surface, the development of surface roughness obeys Poisson statistics: as the atomic  fluence increases, the surface roughness increases as the square root of the fluence (Banks et al.,  2001). Figure 17, Scanning Electron Microscope Images of Directed LEO Atomic Oxygen  Textured Materials, shows examples of atomic-oxygen-textured surfaces of three materials from  the EOIM III and LDEF spaceflight experiments after fixed-orientation exposure to atomic  oxygen in LEO (Banks et al., 2004, MRS). In addition to polymer thickness loss, such texturing  causes an increase in diffuse reflectance and a decrease in specular transmittance of polymers  (Banks et al., 1985, AIAA).

Computational modeling of the surfaces also predicts the development of  such surface cones (Banks et al., 2001; Banks et al., 1997). Atomic oxygen textured surfaces  have significant biomedical applications because they have greatly decreased water contact  angles and cell attachment (Banks et al., 2001; Berger et al., 2007).  he peak-to-valley distance of the cones increases with atomic oxygen fluence as the square root  of the fluence (Banks et al., 2001). Figure 18, Scanning Electron Microscope Images at Protected  Mesas of Directed LEO Atomic Oxygen Textured Materials, shows the heights of the cones  relative to the average erosion depths for pyrolytic graphite, polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H, and Teflon\uf0d2  FEP at protected mesa locations (Banks et al., 2004, MRS).

The particles remain in contact with  each other and gradually, as more are exposed, shield the underlying polymer content from  further atomic oxygen erosion, unless they are loosened or moved by external contact or  abrasion. Thus, the erosion yield of such polymers can gradually decrease with atomic oxygen  fluence.  t is interesting to note that the 100 plane of carbon in the form of single crystal class IIa  diamond does not erode with atomic oxygen exposure (Banks and Stueber, 1997; Shpilman et  al., 2010). This is thought to be because of the formation of a protective surface formed by close-  together oxygen atoms that have replaced hydrogen atoms at the terminations of tetrahedrally  coordinated carbon on the external surface of diamond.                      he most common approach to protecting susceptible spacecraft materials from atomic oxygen  erosion is to coat the material with a thin atomic oxygen protective film, such as a metal, metal  oxide, or fluoropolymer-filled metal oxide protective coating (Banks et al., 1984; Banks et al.,  2002; Dever et al.,1996; Goode et al., 1994; Rutledge and Mihelcic, 1990). Thin film coatings of  silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), indium tin oxide (ITO), germanium (Ge),  silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and gold (Au) with thicknesses ranging from a few hundred  angstroms to more than 100 nm are typically applied by sputter deposition or vapor deposition  (Dever et al., 2005). Although metal oxide coatings as thin as ~5.0 nm can provide atomic  oxygen protection on extremely smooth surfaces, usually thicknesses of ~100 nm are used to  provide coverage over irregularities such as debris, pits, and rills on polymer surfaces (Dever et  al., 2005). It is critical that the substrate to be coated be extremely smooth and free from surface  roughness, such as scratches, rills, pits, and abrupt ridges, to prevent pin windows from  developing in protective coatings. The application of 130-nm SiO2 protective coatings on  Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide can frequently reduce the rate of weight loss caused by atomic oxygen  erosion of Kapton\uf0d2 to less than 1 percent of that of unprotected Kapton\uf0d2 (Rutledge and Olle,  1993). Coatings that are factors thicker than 100 nm can more easily crack or spall because of  their intrinsic stress or their inability to conform with flexure compression or expansion at the  polymer substrate interface (Dever et al., 2005). The addition of small amounts of fluoropolymer  to metal oxide coatings allows greater strain-to-failure ratios in the coatings. Such coatings can  be deposited by co-sputter deposition of SiO2 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon\uf0d2  (Banks et al., 1985, AIAA; Banks et al., 1984). Because only limited flexibility of the solar array  blankets is needed at array segment hinge locations, 130-nm-thick SiO2 magnetron sputter  deposition coatings are used on Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide solar array blankets on the ISS (Rutledge  and Olle, 1993).  surface can result in defects in the protective coating. These coating defects can provide  pathways for atomic oxygen attack, and undercutting erosion of the substrate can occur, even  under directed ram atomic oxygen exposure in LEO. Figure 19, Scanning Electron Microscope  Images of Undercutting Erosion at Defect Sites in Aluminized Kapton\uf0d2 Exposed to LEO on the  LDEF, shows scanning electron microscope images of LEO-exposed aluminized-Kapton\uf0d2 from  the LDEF at sites of pinhole and crack defects in the Al protective coating (de Groh and Banks,  1994; Banks et al., 2004, AIAA). After removal of the Al coating, undercut cavities developed  during flight at the coating defect sites, as shown in Figure 19 (b).                (b) After Chemical Removal of the Al  Coating  Figure 19\u2014Scanning Electron Microscope Images of Undercutting Erosion at Defect Sites  in Aluminized Kapton\u00ae Exposed to LEO on the LDEF   Figure 20, Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Degradation of the Solar Array Wing Blanket Box  Cover on the ISS after 1 Year of LEO Space Exposure, where atomic oxygen undercutting  erosion has severely degraded the P6 Truss port solar array wing two-surface aluminized-  Kapton\uf0d2 blanket box cover on the ISS (Banks et al., 2004, JSR). Therefore, the atomic oxygen  durability of polymers that are protected by thin-film coatings is largely dependent upon the  number and size of pinhole and scratch defects in the protective coatings. The growth of  undercut cavities has been studied for polymer films coated on one side or both sides through the  use of Monte Carlo computational modeling (Banks et al., 1998; Banks et al., 1990; Banks et al.,  1992; Banks and Stueber, 1997; Banks et al., 2003; Banks et al., 2004, JSR). Modeling the  double-coated Kapton\uf0d2 solar array wing blanket box covers on the ISS indicated that the extent  of undercutting damage would have been significantly less, because of less scattering in the  undercut cavity, if the blanket had been coated only on the front (space-facing) side and not on  both sides (Banks et al., 2004, JSR). The model predictions are shown in Figure 21, Monte Carlo  Computational Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Erosion Predictions for a 45\u00b0-from-Perpendicular  Angle of Attack of Atomic Oxygen at a Crack or Scratch Defect of the Aluminized Kapton\uf0d2  Surfaces.             Figure 20\u2014Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Degradation of the Solar Array Wing Blanket  Box Cover on the ISS after 1 Year of LEO Space Exposure    Figure 21\u2014Monte Carlo Computational Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Erosion Predictions  for a 45\u00b0-from-Perpendicular Angle of Attack of Atomic Oxygen at a Crack or Scratch  Defect of the Aluminized Kapton\u00ae Surfaces  he sensitivity of a hydrocarbon material to reaction with atomic oxygen is quantified by the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of the material. The atomic oxygen erosion yield is the volume of a  material that is removed (through oxidation) per incident oxygen atom and is measured in units  of cm3/atom. The atomic oxygen erosion yield is also often referred to as the recession rate and,  in the past, has been called atomic oxygen reaction efficiency. The most well-characterized  atomic oxygen erosion yield is that of polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H, which has an erosion yield of  3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom for LEO 4.5-eV atomic oxygen (Banks et al., 1985, TSF; Visentine et al.,  1985; Koontz et al., 1995; Silverman, 1995). As atomic oxygen erosion of polymers in LEO is a  serious threat to spacecraft performance and durability, it is essential to understand the atomic  oxygen erosion yield of polymers for spacecraft applications so that the durability of materials  being considered for spacecraft design can be predicted. Because spaceflight opportunities are                       rare, expensive, space-limited, and time-consuming, ground laboratory testing is often relied  upon for spacecraft material environmental durability prediction. However, differences exist  between ground facilities and actual space exposures, which may result in material-dependent  differences in rates of reactions. Therefore, actual spaceflight atomic oxygen erosion yield data  (volume loss in cm3 per incident oxygen atom) are needed to best assess the durability of a  material for spacecraft mission applicability. In addition, data from actual materials spaceflight  experiments can be used to determine correlations between exposures in ground test facilities  and space exposure, allowing for more accurate predictions of in-space materials performance  based on ground facility testing.     laboratory atomic oxygen exposure are mass loss and recession depth. Advantages and  disadvantages to both techniques are discussed below.   uses mass loss measurements. The mass loss measurements should be made by weighing  vacuum-dehydrated samples before and after atomic oxygen exposure, as described in  ASTM E 2089-00, Standard Practices for Ground Laboratory Atomic Oxygen Interaction  Evaluation of Materials for Space Applications. Measurements for dehydration are to be  performed using equipment calibrated to national requirements for accuracy. The erosion yield  of the sample is calculated through the following equation:      et al., 1985, TSF; Visentine et al., 1985; Koontz et al., 1995; Silverman, 1995, P1), it is  commonly used as a witness sample to compute the atomic oxygen fluence during flight  experiments in LEO. In ground laboratory equipment, such as an RF plasma asher or an atomic  oxygen beam facility, the energy, flux, and arrival of atomic oxygen can vary from that in LEO.  For example, the Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluence for a thermal energy plasma measured in a ground  laboratory facility is not the actual number of atoms/cm2 striking the surface, because thermal  energy atoms (\u22480.04 eV) require orders of magnitude more atoms to erode as much material as  Ey = atomic oxygen erosion yield of test sample (cm3/atom)  \uf044Ms = mass loss of test sample (g)  As = surface area of test sample exposed to atomic oxygen (cm2)  s = density of test sample (g/cm3)  \uf072  F = fluence of atomic oxygen (atoms/cm2).

Therefore, in a ground facility, the effective fluence (FE) of the  exposure is the atomic oxygen fluence in LEO that would produce the same amount of erosion in  the ground-based facility (ASTM E 2089-00).      F  FE = atomic oxygen effective fluence in ground laboratory facility (atoms/cm2)  \uf044MK = mass loss of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample (g)  AK = surface area of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample exposed to atomic oxygen (cm2)  K = density of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample (1.4273 g/cm3) (de Groh et al., 2008)  \uf072  EK = erosion yield of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample in LEO (3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom).    ne of the critical issues with using mass loss data to obtain accurate erosion yield data is that  dehydrated mass measurements are needed. Many polymer materials, such as Kapton\uf0d2, are very  hygroscopic and can absorb up to several percent of their weight in moisture and, therefore, can  fluctuate in mass with humidity and temperature. Small changes in mass loss related to atomic  oxygen erosion can be difficult to measure accurately if the state of hydration is variable;  weighing the samples in a dehydrated state largely eliminates this source of error. Therefore, for  accurate mass loss measurements, it is necessary that the samples be fully dehydrated, e.g., in a  vacuum desiccator, before both pre-flight and post-flight measurements. Full dehydration for  samples \u2264127 \u00b5m (\u22645 mil) thick requires a minimum of 48 hours for vacuum dehydration at  pressures below 200 mtorr.   a Function of Time after Removal from Vacuum Dehydration, provides an example of a  rehydration curve for Kapton\uf0d2 H shortly after removal from a vacuum dehydration environment.  The graph shows the fractional mass gained during rehydration of a 127-\u00b5m- (5-mil-) thick  Kapton\uf0d2 H film after dehydration in a vacuum desiccator for \uf03e72 hours.

This is partly because some flight experiments, such as short-duration Shuttle flight  experiments, were exposed to low atomic oxygen fluences on orbit, but variations in much of the  early LEO space data also occurred because some erosion yield data were not determined based  on dehydrated mass measurements, introducing large error for hygroscopic materials, especially  for low fluence exposures or low erosion yield samples.    step heights. The erosion or recession depth can be measured from a protected surface using  profilometry with a stylus profilometer or with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical  interferometry, or atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Minton, 1995). If the surface is protected by  an intimate tin mask or mesh or a protective film, the erosion yield can be calculated through the  following equations:                                    profilometry, SEM, and optical interferometry, are not sensitive enough or have other faults. For  example, an SEM is not suited for obtaining accurate erosion depth measurements (z-direction)  and making stylus measurements on soft polymers can be problematic. One technique that  maintains accuracy for very small step-height measurements is AFM. AFM can have a lateral  resolution of 10 to 20 \u00c5 and sub-angstrom vertical resolution (Howland and Benatar, 1996).  y = erosion step height (cm)  F = atomic oxygen fluence in LEO (atoms/cm2)  FE = atomic oxygen effective fluence in ground laboratory facility (atoms/cm2).    etal meshes, such as a stainless-steel or nickel-etched meshes, have been used to protect  surfaces from atomic oxygen attack, resulting in step-height changes between the eroded areas  and covered areas (Minton, 1995). A frequent problem with using a mesh is that it needs to be  very thin and in close contact with the surface of the polymer for accurate step-height  measurement. However, it is very difficult to place a thin mesh in close contact with a polymer.  In de Groh et al. (2001, AFM), the quantification of the error associated with the thickness and  closeness of a mesh with respect to the polymer, i.e., the distance of the exposed mesh surface to  the protected polymer surface, is reviewed. It was found that the height of the mesh with respect  to the protected surface plays a critical role in the error of erosion yield measurements.    oatings such as metals, SiO2, and Al2O3 are listed as serving as potential effective masks as  long as the coatings are \uf0b320 nm thick (Minton, 1995). The problem with the mask technique is  that the thickness of the coating needs to be very accurately known for low fluence exposures,  and the coating must end cleanly and sharply. A gradual thinning of the protective coating at its  margin, which commonly occurs, will contribute to step-height errors (de Groh et al., 2001,  AFM).    involves pre-flight protection of the sample surface using small, isolated particles in contact with  the sample surface (de Groh, et al., 2001, AFM). These particles, such as salt crystals or mica  powder, are applied either by salt spraying or mica dusting, resulting in isolated protective  particles. The particles are removed post-flight, e.g., the salt is washed off with distilled water  and the surface is then dried with nitrogen gas; erosion depth step-height or recession          Fy  E           measurements are then obtained using AFM. Salt-spraying and mica-dusting techniques and  AFM profiling are discussed in detail in de Groh et al., (2001, AFM). Figure 23, High-  Magnification Image of a Graphite Epoxy Composite Sample Flown as Part of the EOIM III  Experiment aboard STS-46 and Exposed to an Atomic Oxygen Fluence of 2.3\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2,  is an example of how a small particle can protect the underlying polymer from atomic oxygen  erosion (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM).

A uniform distribution of small cubic crystals is ideal.  Experiments conducted for the development of the PEACE Polymers experiment have shown  that salt spraying can result in the formation of a variety of different salt particles (de Groh et al.,  2001, AFM), such as small or large cubic crystals, oval or asymmetric spherical particles,  crystals with salt \u201crings\u201d around them, and ring deposits that form doughnut-shaped appearances  after drying. Figure 24, Different Types of Sodium Chloride Salt Particles Formed on a Kapton\uf0d2  HN Substrate during Salt-Spraying, shows examples of these different salt particle formations  (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). Issues related to salt rings and possible condensation build-up  effects on experiments in the Shuttle bay (while in the Cape Canaveral environment) are  provided by de Groh et al. (2001, AFM).

Error analyses were performed for this technique and for the traditional  erosion yield determination technique based on mass loss; as expected, both were highly  dependent on atomic oxygen fluence. Also, the recession technique was found to be very  dependent on protective particle height and to be more accurate than the mass loss technique for  protective particles <17 \u00b5m thick (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). For example, for a fluence of  1\uf0b41019 atoms/cm2, the probable error in atomic oxygen erosion yield found using the AFM  recession technique (using a 10-\u00b5m-thick protective particle) is approximately 60 percent of the  error in the erosion yield found using the mass loss technique (7.74 percent versus 13.1 percent,  respectively) (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). These error analysis results stress the importance of  using small particles in contact with the test material, such as cubic salt crystals, or very thin  mica dust particles.     Department of Defense (DoD) organizations, industry, and universities. For more than a decade,  MISSE has studied the long-duration environmental durability of spacecraft materials and  devices in the LEO environment through a series of materials spaceflight experiments. The                  overall objective of MISSE is to test the stability and durability of materials and devices in the  space environment to gain valuable knowledge of the performance of materials in space, as well  as to enable lifetime prediction of new materials and components that may be used in future  spaceflight.   containers, called Passive Experiment Containers (PECs) (de Groh et al., 2009). (See Figure 25,  Pre-Flight Photograph of MISSE PEC 2). The PECs are exposed to the space environment on the  exterior of the ISS (de Groh, 2010). During transport to the ISS on the Space Shuttle, the PECs  are closed with the samples facing each other for protection; once the Space Shuttle reaches the  ISS, the PECs are attached to its exterior during an extravehicular activity (EVA) and opened  back-to-back, exposing the samples to space (de Groh et al., 2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006,  NSMMS; Groh et al., 2009). (See Figure 26, During a spacewalk on August 16, 2001, astronaut  Patrick Forrester installs MISSE PEC 2 on the ISS Quest Airlock, and Figure 27, MISSE 1  during an EVA in January 2003 after 17 Months of Space Exposure.) The PECs are retrieved  after 1 or more years of space exposure and returned to Earth for post-flight evaluations of the  experiments.

Each of these orientations  provides different space environmental exposures. For example, samples in a ram orientation  receive the greatest amount of atomic oxygen exposure combined with solar radiation exposure,  while those in a wake orientation receive solar radiation exposure with very little atomic oxygen  exposure. Zenith-facing samples receive the highest amount of solar radiation and grazing  atomic oxygen exposure, and nadir-facing samples receive little solar exposure (only ambient  reflected solar exposure) with grazing atomic oxygen exposure. Ten MISSE PECs have flown,  along with a small passive tray called the Optical Reflector Materials Experiment III Ram/Wake  (ORMatE-III R/W).

MISSE has provided rapid  access to space, producing mission-critical solar cell performance data for groups such as the  Naval Research Center (NRL) (Walters et al., 2005). MISSE solar cell experiments have  provided anomaly resolution data for on-orbit spacecraft, real-time data that have enabled DoD  mission hardware to be designed and built in a timely manner, and on-orbit data for ground-test  data validation. The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Air Force Research Laboratory (WPAFB  AFRL) has also seen immeasurable benefits from MISSE, such as new higher power solar cell  technology, electromagnetic-shielding nano-materials, and improved understanding of atomic  oxygen erosion (Juhl, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). Boeing has obtained space radiation dose  measurements through experiments on MISSE (Wert, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). The  Aerospace Corporation has found that MISSE experiments reduce the risk of incorporating new  technology into future satellite systems and provide an inexpensive way to evaluate vendor space  readiness on a small scale (Palusinski, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). The Aerospace Corporation  uses MISSE data to educate vendors on surviving space environments, with an emphasis on  material processes (quality, packaging, contamination, etc.) (Palusinski, 2010; de Groh et al.,  2011). Like many MISSE investigators, The Aerospace Corporation uses the MISSE flight data           n summary, MISSE is the longest running technology development and materials testing project  on the ISS, resulting in many impacts on spacecraft materials and device design choices. The  MISSE experiments are yielding long-duration space environmental performance and durability  data that enable material validation, processing recertification, and space qualification; improved  predictions of materials and component lifetimes in space; model verification and development;  and correlation factors between space exposure and ground facilities that enable more accurate  in-space performance predictions based on ground laboratory testing.  engineering, such as the NASA GRC experiments conducted in collaboration with students from  Hathaway Brown School in Shaker Heights, OH. Student involvement includes pre-flight  research, flight sample fabrication and characterization, and post-flight characterization.

Additional polymers were included to explore erosion  yield dependence upon chemical composition, with the goal of developing a predictive model for  erosion yield.    9. MISSE 2 POLYMER EROSION AND CONTAMINATION  EXPERIMENT POLYMERS  t was decided that mass loss was the best measurement technique for this flight experiment  because many of the PEACE Polymers are composed of multiple thin-film layers, as described in  section 9.2.2 of this NASA Technical Handbook, and erosion can occur through multiple layers  (de Groh et al., 2008). In addition, individual layers can be so fragile after erosion that recession  depth measurements would be impossible to obtain. With mass loss measurements, an average  mass of the fragile pieces and layers and underlying non-eroded supportive layers can be  obtained. Extensive error analysis was conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield  values for each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight samples. The uncertainty values are  provided in section 9.3.6 of this NASA Technical Handbook, and the specifics of the error  analysis are provided in Appendix B of this NASA Technical Handbook. In addition to the LEO  erosion yield of the flight samples, optical and thermal properties of the flight samples were also  obtained post-flight and compared with control sample properties, as reviewed in section 9.3.7 of  this NASA Technical Handbook. Appendices C and D of this NASA Technical Handbook  provide the optical properties and summary pages for each individual flight sample. Details on  the specific polymers flown, flight sample fabrication, pre-flight and post-flight characterization  techniques, and atomic oxygen fluence determination are discussed in this section, along with a  summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results.  range of polymeric materials and bonding types. The polymers chosen included those commonly  used for spacecraft applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP and white Tedlar\uf0d2, as well as more  recently developed polymers, such as high-temperature PMR. Pyrolytic graphite and polymers  such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) and cellulose acetate (CA) were also included based solely on  their chemical composition to provide LEO erosion yield data for modeling purposes. Two  polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H samples were included to serve as atomic oxygen fluence witness samples.  The 40 polymers and pyrolytic graphite, their associated polymer abbreviations, and the MISSE  serial numbers are listed in Table 3, MISSE PEACE Polymers List.

Most polymers were in  thin-film form and typically ranged from 0.0025 to 0.051 cm thick. Samples were punched into  circular discs using a double-bow punch cutter and an Arbor press.  2-E5-14), typically used as lens material, was ordered from a manufacturer in 2.54-cm-diameter,  0.079-cm-thick samples. Pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was also ordered in 2.54-cm-diameter  pieces, 0.203 cm thick. Hysol\uf0d2 EA 956 epoxy (EP, 2-E5-19) was purchased as a two-part kit.  Although epoxy is available as reasonably mixed systems, care should be exercised to ensure  that the mixtures are accurate so that the epoxy results in verifiable characteristics, as specified.  Flight samples were fabricated by mixing and curing the epoxy and then carefully sawing out  2.54-cm-diameter samples from brittle sheets of cured epoxy. The thickness of the epoxy flight  sample was \uf0bb0.231 cm. Polyethylene oxide (PEO, 2-E5-17) was purchased as a powder and  fabricated into sheet material by pressing the powder with heated plates using a Carver  Laboratory Press. To keep the PEO from sticking to the plates, two sheets of Kapton\uf0d2 were  placed between the press plates and the PEO powder. The PEO powder was pressed at 10.5  metric tons for 5 to 10 sec with the press plates heated to 260 \u00b0C. Although the press pressure  and temperate are somewhat arbitrary, what is important is the density of the individual sample,  because PEO erosion yields for samples of different densities are simply inversely proportional  to the ratio of the densities, so that a PEO sample of half the density would have twice the  erosion yield. After pressing and cooling the PEO, the Kapton\uf0d2 sheets were carefully separated  from the PEO sheet, which was between 0.74 and 0.94 cm thick, from which 2.54-cm-diameter  samples were punched. High-temperature polyimide resin (PI, 2-E5-34), also known as PMR-15,  was fabricated by the Polymers Branch at GRC in 2.54-cm-diameter, 0.030-cm-thick pieces.  Poly-(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPD-T, 2-E5-8), also known as Kevlar\uf0d2 29, was obtained  in fabric form, from which flight samples were cut. Al discs were applied to the backs of the  flight samples and wrapped around the non-spaced exposed edges to protect against fraying or  loss of small filaments. Polyphenylene isophthalate (PPPA), also known as Nomex\uf0d2, was  supplied as 0.005-cm-thick sheets of paper, from which flight samples were punched.          ISSEs 1 and 2 were originally planned as a 1-year mission. The expected atomic oxygen  fluence for a 1-year exposure on the ISS is 3.28\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 for directed atomic oxygen  exposed surfaces, based on a mission launch date of June 2001, a 400-km circular orbit, and a  51.6\u00b0 inclination. For many of the thin-film polymers, a single layer would be completely eroded  away after a 1-year mission. In addition, flight experiments are not always retrieved on the  original planned date and can be left in space much longer. Depending on the polymer thickness  and estimated erosion yield, stacking of several layers was necessary for many polymers. The  total number of layers to be stacked for flight was determined based on the amount of material  that would theoretically survive a 3-year mission (three times the duration of the original planned  mission).         causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the mass change; a sample with the lowest possible mass is  ideal so that the mass loss is a significant percent of the total mass of the sample. With this in  mind, two different sets of samples were stacked together for flight. The first set, called Part A,  included the number of sample layers needed to survive an atomic oxygen exposure period of  1.5 years (chosen to be 0.5 years longer than the mission). The second set, called Part B, was  added behind the weighed set and included the number of additional sample layers needed to  survive a 3-year mission.   determined based on the estimated erosion yield of each polymer and the expected atomic  oxygen fluence for a 1.5-year mission, computed to be 4.55\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2. The total number of  layers to be stacked together as one flight sample (Parts A and B) was calculated based on the  expected atomic oxygen fluence for a 3-year mission, computed to be 9.1\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 (twice  the 1.5-year fluence). The additional unweighed set (Part B) was placed behind the weighed set  (Part A) in the flight hardware. Figure 31, Flight Sample Setup, shows an illustration of the flight  sample.    or example, the estimated erosion yield for CA is 6.8\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom (Integrity Testing  Laboratory Inc., 1998). Based on this erosion yield, the estimated thickness loss for 1.5 years in  LEO is 0.031 cm. The thickness of one sample layer is only 0.005 cm; therefore, seven sample  layers were stacked for mass measurements. A total of 0.062 cm was expected to be eroded away  after 3 years, so 13 total layers were stacked for flight (the 7 weighed Part A layers plus 6  additional unweighed Part B layers).   of stock material (or from the same batch of fabricated material) and characterized. All  individual sample layers were carefully scribe marked at the edges to indicate sample  identification, orientation (front), flight or backup sample, and whether the sample had been  vacuum heat treated. The backup sample, prepared in case something happened to the flight  sample before installation in the flight hardware, was used as a ground-control sample. It is  typically referred to as the control sample.    Flight Sample Part A  (enough layers to  survive 1.5 yr)  Flight Sample Part B  (enough additional  layers to survive  a total of 3 yr)           amples to be flown in the space environment need to meet outgas requirements as outlined in  ASTM E 595, Standard Test Method for Total Mass Loss and Collected Volatile Condensable  Materials from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment. This test method evaluates, under  carefully controlled conditions, the changes in mass (total mass loss (TML)) of a test specimen  exposed to a temperature of 125 \uf0b0C under vacuum and the mass of the products that leave the  specimen and condense on a cooler collector plate set at a temperature of 25 \uf0b0C (collected  volatile condensable materials (CVCMs)) (ASTM E 595). MISSE management decided that  materials being flown as part of MISSEs 1 and 2 should meet the historical screening levels of  <1.00 percent TML and <0.10 percent CVCM. Of the 41 PEACE polymers, 10 did not meet the  outgas requirements, based on previous testing or because they had not been tested. It was  decided that these polymers could be flown if they were vacuum heat treated before flight to  remove volatile products. Vacuum heat treatment was conducted at MSFC at a pressure of 7\uf0b410\u2013  5 Pa. Ideally, samples were to be vacuum baked for 24 hours at 125 \uf0b0C (similar to ASTM E 595),  but some polymers were heated at lower temperatures because of low maximum operating  temperatures. Table 4, Vacuum Heat Treated MISSE PEACE Polymers, lists the vacuum heat  treated samples, their maximum operating temperatures, and the vacuum heat treatment  temperature and time.

For this reason, the four layers of the flight sample were stacked together (after mass  measurements were obtained) and held flat for flight by being mounted in an Al holder similar to  the one used for the Kevlar\uf0d2 fabric.    vacuum heat treatment, where applicable). The Part A sample sets were dehydrated in a vacuum  desiccator maintained at a pressure of 8.0 to 13.3 Pa with a mechanical roughing pump.  Typically, 5 flight sample sets and their corresponding control samples were placed together in a  desiccator (a total of 10 sample sets). The sets of samples were placed in the desiccator and left  under vacuum for a minimum of 4 days. The vacuum desiccator was put back under vacuum            immediately after a sample set was removed to keep the other samples in the desiccator under  vacuum. Previous tests showed that the mass of a given dehydrated sample was not adversely  affected if the desiccator was opened and quickly closed again and pumped back down to  approximately 20 Pa before that sample was weighed. This process allows multiple samples to  be dehydrated together. Three mass readings for each sample was obtained and averaged, and the  time at which each sample was first exposed to air was recorded, along with the times at which it  was weighed. The total time it took to obtain the three readings for one sample, starting from the  time air was let into the desiccator, was typically 5 minutes. The samples were weighed using  either a Mettler Balance 3M (0.000001-g sensitivity) or a Sartorius Balance R160P (0.00001-g  sensitivity), depending on total sample mass. Records were kept of the following: the sequence  of sample weighing, the number of layers in each Part A set, the time under vacuum before  weighing, the temperature and humidity in the room, the time air was let into the desiccator, the  time each sample set was taken out of the desiccator, and the time of each weighing. The same  procedure and sequence were repeated with the same samples post-flight.    because of processing variations among the sheets of the materials. To obtain more accurate  density values control for this variation, density measurements were obtained for 36 of the 41  polymers using calibrated density gradient columns. Density gradient columns were created in a  50-mL buret with varying proportions of either cesium chloride (CsCl), \uf072 \uf0bb 2 g/cm3, andH2O, \uf072  = 1 g/cm3, for less dense polymers, or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), \uf072 = 1.594 g/cm3, and  bromoform (CHBr3), \uf072 = 2.899 g/cm3, for denser polymers. Because of the variation in density of  the polymers, numerous columns with variations in initial mixed solutions were made that  allowed a wide range of densities to be determined. Glass standards of known densities  (\uf0b10.0001 g/cm3) were placed in the column and allowed to settle, and then small pieces of  various polymers were placed in the columns. A curve was fit to the positions and relative  known densities of the glass standards. Plotting the positions of the test polymers on this curve  yielded density values for each material (de Groh et al., 2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006,  NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2008). The density values for approximately half of the polymers were  determined based on averages obtained from more than one density column.  ive polymers either had density values out of the range of the density columns or were of a  form not easily sectioned for density column measurements. The densities for these materials  (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), PPPA, and PG)  were obtained from referenced literature or manufacturers\u2019 Material Safety Data Sheets  (MSDSs). The densities of the PEACE Polymer samples, along with uncertainty values, are  provided in Table 5, Density Gradient Column Data for the PEACE Polymers.

Each sample was assigned a serial number to indicate its  position; for example, ABS, with serial number 2-E5-6, represents the sample in MISSE PEC 2,  Tray E5, sample position 6. Five other samples (four DC 93-500 silicone samples and one  atomic oxygen scattering chamber) were also on this tray in positions 2-E5-1 through 2-E5-5.  Sample positions were assigned based on anticipated erosion yields or by grouping samples by  polymer family, such as the polyimides. Samples with high erosion yields were located next to  the silicone samples, as they were less likely to be affected by silicone cross-contamination.

Estimated environmental conditions of solar exposure,  tray temperatures, and ionizing radiation doses on MISSEs 1 and 2 are described in detail by  Pippin (2006). For the ram-facing side of MISSE PEC 2 (exposed to atomic oxygen and solar  radiation), the total equivalent sun hours (ESH) was estimated to be 5,000 to 6,700 ESH. This  total includes Earth-reflected illumination (650 to 820 ESH). The spectrum of Earth reflection  solar radiation has a reduced contribution from the VUV portion of the spectrum because of  absorption by Earth\u2019s atmosphere (Pippin, 2006). Tray E5 was computed to have received  approximately 6,300 ESH. The 3.95-year exposure in LEO resulted in approximately 22,800  thermal cycles; Pippin reports the baseplate thermal cycling temperature range for MISSE 2 to be  nominally between 40 and -30 \u00b0C, with occasional short-term excursions to more extreme  temperatures.  MISSE 2. Data from thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) with thin shielding layers are most  relevant to estimates of doses for the PEACE Polymer experiment thin polymer films.

Black-light inspection of the trays showed minimal to no contamination visible on  the MISSE surfaces (Pippin, 2006), and results of XPS contamination analyses of two MISSE 2  sapphire witness samples in sample Tray E6 (located next to Tray E5) indicated an extremely  thin silica contaminant layer (1.3 and 1.4 nm on each slide, respectively) (Dever et al., 2006).

Therefore, the flight erosion yield data were  measurably affected by contamination, which further increases the importance of these long-  duration flight data.    igure 33, PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray in the NASA LaRC Clean Room during Post-  Flight Retrieval Examination, is a post-retrieval photograph of the experiment tray as observed  directly after PEC 2 was opened for the first time at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). As  expected, many of the polymer samples were significantly degraded. Figure 34, Post-Flight  Photograph of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray, shows the experiment (Tray E5)  after de-integration from MISSE PEC 2.  Figure 33\u2014PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray in the NASA LaRC Clean Room during  Post-Flight Retrieval Examination                    Planning for a 3-year exposure (rather than for the anticipated 1-year exposure) was found to be  crucial to this experiment\u2019s success: even though the experiment received nearly 4 years of  atomic oxygen exposure, material was left for all samples except one (PBI, 2-E5-35).  nce Tray E5 was brought back to NASA GRC, post-flight photo-documentation of the samples  was conducted. Photographs were taken of the individual samples before removal of the try, after  removal from the tray (left in a flight stack next to the control stack), and with the individual  sample layers separated. Details on the number of layers for each sample that were eroded  completely, the number that were textured by erosion, and the number remaining non-eroded  were recorded. For samples for which additional stacked layers (Part B) had been placed behind  the weighed layers (Part A), Parts A and B were separated for weighing. For some samples,  however, the individual layers could not be separated from each other without damaging the  sample texture or losing gossamer pieces of residual material; in these cases, all layers were kept  together for post-flight sample weighing. The post-flight weighing procedures replicated the pre-  flight weighing procedures in terms of the vacuum dehydration process (dehydration time,  sample order, and weighing technique) as closely as possible, with the only exception occurring  when Parts A and B could not be separated because of the extent of the erosion, which could  cause intermingling and/or loss of sample mass during weighing.  s previously mentioned, each flight sample included two sets of sample layers: Part A was  enough material to last for 1.5 years in space, theoretically, and the additional layers of Part B  extended the time to approximately 3 years. Each flight sample also had a corresponding  identical backup sample (including both Parts A and B) that was kept on the ground as a control  sample. Though flight sample Parts A and B were not separated during flight, they were  separated for pre- and post-flight weighing. This is because, with mission time constraints, only  Part A of each sample was weighed pre-flight; therefore, a theoretical value for the pre-flight  mass of Part B was calculated. The pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A (MF) and the pre-  flight mass of control sample Part A (MC) were used to calculate the average mass per layer  (MA), which was multiplied by the number (n) of layers in flight sample Part B to get Part B\u2019s  theoretical pre-flight mass (n\u00b7MA).  here were three different situations (Situations 1 through 3) for post-flight sample weighing;  therefore, three different equations to determine mass loss were required. Details of the mass loss  equations are provided in Appendix B of this NASA Technical Handbook, along with the error  analysis equations.  n Situation 1 (Figure 35, Illustration of Situation 1 Sample Erosion), either only one sample  layer was flown or the atomic oxygen eroded through only some of the layers in flight sample  Part A and all layers of flight sample Part B were still pristine (non-eroded). Because flight  sample Part A and flight sample Part B were weighed separately pre-flight, in this situation, only  Part A needed to be weighed post-flight and compared with its pre-flight mass. This was the  ideal situation, because it minimized error by omitting the variable of the mass of Part B.            Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B    pilex-S\uf0d2 (biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and diamine) (PI, 2-E5-32) is an  example of a Situation 1 sample. Figure 36, Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2) (11  Layers, each 0.0025 cm thick), shows the stacked flight sample next to the stacked control  sample. Eleven layers was stacked together and flown; Part A was comprised of 6 layers, and  Part B was comprised of 5 layers. The individual layers of the flight sample are shown in Figure  37, Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2) with Layers Separated (11 Layers, each 0.025 cm  thick), alongside the layers of the control sample. During flight, only the top four layers of Part A  experienced erosion: the top two layers were completely eroded, leaving the ring under the lip of  Tray E5. The third layer was eroded with holes at the atomic oxygen textured cone valleys, and  the fourth layer was eroded in places corresponding to the cone valley holes in the third layer.  Because only Part A of this flight sample experienced erosion, Part A was separated from Part B  post-flight, and only Part A was weighed and compared to the pre-flight mass of Part A to  calculate its flight experiment mass loss.       Pre-Flight  (pristine)   Partially  eroded  through                   Figure 37\u2014Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\u00ae) with Layers Separated (11 Layers,  each 0.025 cm thick)  Pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25), shown in Figure 38, Post-Flight Photograph of Pyrolytic  Graphite (1 Layer, 2,032 \uf06dm thick), is another example of a Situation 1 sample. A single thick  layer (0.203 cm) was flown; Part A was one layer, and there was no Part B. The post-flight  sample is shown next to the control sample in Figure 38. The resulting atomic oxygen erosion  texture produced a velvety-looking matte black surface in the area of exposure.                        n Situation 2 (Figure 39, Illustration of Situation 2 Sample Erosion), atomic oxygen erosion  occurred through all the layers of flight sample Part A and through some of flight sample Part B.  In this situation, flight sample Parts A and B were able to be separated to be weighed post-flight.  Because flight sample Part B was not weighed pre-flight, its theoretical pre-flight mass was used.   Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B   tomic oxygen fluence witness sample Kapton\uf0d2 H (2-E5-30) is an example of a Situation 2  sample. As shown in Figure 40, Post-Flight Photograph of Kapton\uf0d2 H with Layers Separated (3  Layers, each 0.0127 cm thick), three 0.0127-cm-thick layers were flown. Part A consisted of two  layers, and Part B consisted of one layer. During flight, atomic oxygen eroded the top layer  completely and eroded partially through the second layer, leaving a gossamer-thin cone-like  textured film. Holes in the valleys of the cones of the second layer allowed the third layer to be  exposed to and textured by atomic oxygen. In this case, therefore, pre-flight and post-flight mass  measurements were needed for both Parts A and B.    Pre-Flight  (pristine)   Completely  eroded  through  Partially  eroded  through             Figure 40\u2014Post-Flight Photograph of Kapton\u00ae H with Layers Separated (3 Layers, each  0.0127 cm thick)  n Situation 3 (Figure 41, Illustration of Situation 3 Sample Erosion), the sample layers were  stuck together and fragmented and were too fragile to separate without losing particles of the  material and therefore compromising the erosion yield data. Because of this, flight sample Parts  A and B were weighed together post-flight.     Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B     Pre-Flight  (pristine)   Partially  eroded  through                     Atomic oxygen fluence witness sample Kapton\uf0d2 H (PI, 2-E5-33) is an example of a Situation 3  sample (Figure 42, Post-Flight Photograph of Kapton\uf0d2 H (3 Layers, each 0.0127 cm thick)).  Three 0.0127-cm-thick layers were flown; Part A consisted of two layers, and Part B consisted of  one layer. During flight, atomic oxygen eroded the top layer completely and eroded the second  layer to a cone-like texture. Holes in the valleys of the cones in the second layer allowed the  third layer to be exposed to and textured by atomic oxygen. For this sample, it was not possible  to separate the second layer from the third layer without causing damage; therefore, the post-  flight mass measurements were taken with Part A and B together.     he atomic oxygen fluence for PEC 2 Tray 1 E5 was computed based on the mass loss of two  Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples (2-E5-30 and 2-E5-33). Each Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample consisted  of three 0.0127-cm-thick layers for a total thickness of 0.0381 cm. As stated previously,  Kapton\uf0d2 H is commonly used for fluence calibration because it has a well-characterized erosion  yield in LEO (3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom).   Two techniques for mass loss determination were evaluated: averaging the first three mass  readings and back-extrapolation of the mass data to time zero using linear curve fits to get  theoretically dehydrated mass values. The results of these measurements are provided in  Table 6, Atomic Oxygen Fluence for Kapton\uf0d2 H Calibration Samples.

The average  atomic oxygen fluences for the two different techniques were also very similar. Therefore, it was                 decided to use the average mass value instead of the linear back-extrapolation value for  determining the atomic oxygen fluence for the experiment and also for obtaining the pre- and  post-flight mass values necessary to determine the erosion yields for the individual PEACE  Polymer samples. The average atomic oxygen fluence for the PEACE Polymers experiment  exposure (Tray E5) on MISSE 2 was determined to be 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 (de Groh et al.,  2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2008).    able 7, MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers Erosion Yield Data, provides the erosion yield data for the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, along with mass loss, density, and exposure area data.  After the 4-year mission, 6 of the 41 samples had experienced full-thickness erosion of part of  the sample area (such as one edge) or of the entire sample area. These samples are listed in Table  8, MISSE 2 Samples Partially or Fully Eroded through All Layers, along with a summary of  extent of erosion. Therefore, the erosion yield for each of these samples is actually greater than  the value provided, as indicated in Table 7. These six materials were flown again for erosion  yield determination as part of the MISSE 6A Stressed Polymers Experiment, which experienced  1.45 years of space exposure.

To address this,  the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental erosion yield value was calculated using equations for  fractional uncertainty derived from the equation used to find erosion yield (McCarthy et al.,  2010). The standard deviation or error of each measurement that was used to calculate the  erosion yield was incorporated into the resulting fractional uncertainty of the erosion yield for  each of three different error situations, which correspond to the three post-flight weighing  procedures. The resulting error calculations showed the erosion yield values to be very accurate,  with an average error of \uf0b13.30 percent (McCarthy et al., 2010). Table 9, MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers Erosion Yield Uncertainty Data, provides the fractional uncertainty in erosion yield for  each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (McCarthy et al., 2010).

Because the mission was 3.95 years in duration, many of the polymers  were eroded through several layers, several of the polymers were eroded through all layers in at  least a portion of the exposed area, and one sample was completely eroded. It was determined,  therefore, that the best way to measure the optical and thermal properties of the flight samples  was to determine which layers should be measured and then compare the same number of layers  from the control flight samples. If a sample was partially eroded, the layer or layers that  experienced partial erosion (rather than full erosion, as with the layers above the partially eroded  layers) and the intact layer immediately underneath were analyzed, and the control sample  included the same number of layers, as shown in Figure 43, Schematic Diagram of MISSE 2  Flight Sample Layer Erosion and the Corresponding Layers used for Optical and Thermal  Property Measurements.

For most samples, SR and DR properties changed significantly as a  result of directed LEO atomic oxygen exposure. Generally, there was a decrease in SR with an  increase in DR. These optical property changes are relevant to glare issues, Fresnel lens  photovoltaic concentrator power loss issues, and issues with spatial variations in the thermal load  on a spacecraft.     include the widest variety of well-characterized polymers collectively exposed to the LEO  atomic oxygen space environment for a long duration. The erosion yield values of the MISSE 2  PEACE Polymers were based on mass loss, using dehydrated pre-flight and post-flight mass  measurements. Erosion yield values for numerous prior flight experiments based on mass loss  were not obtained using dehydrated mass values, which introduces large error for either low-  fluence missions (such as Shuttle flight experiments) or low erosion yield samples exposed to  high-fluence missions. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was an extremely clean  experiment, receiving only ~1.3 nm of silica contamination (NASA/TM\u20142006-214482, MISSE  PEACE Polymers Atomic Oxygen Erosion Results). Therefore, the erosion yield data were not  measurably affected by on-orbit contamination. Other long-duration flight experiments, such as  the LDEF, have experienced significant concentrations of silicone/silica contamination; such  contamination adversely affects erosion yield data.   applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, Mylar\uf0d2, and Kapton\uf0d2, to more recently developed polymers,  such as high-temperature polyimide PMR. Additional polymers typically not desired for  spacecraft applications were also included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical  composition for the purpose of the development of a predictive model. Extensive error analyses  have been conducted of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples, documenting the uncertainty in  the erosion yield values.                  paceflight experiments are unique, expensive, and time-consuming, which is why atomic  oxygen ground laboratory testing, such as in an RF plasma asher, is often used for spacecraft  material durability prediction. However, the correlation between in-space degradation and  ground-testing degradation needs to be determined, because ground facilities and the space  environment differ in many ways. These differences include variations in species, energies,  thermal exposures, and radiation exposures, all of which may result in different reactions and  erosion rates. For example, the direction of atomic oxygen arrival can differ between ground  facilities and the space environment. Materials exposed to the LEO environment often receive  either directed or sweeping ram atomic oxygen, whereas in a plasma asher, the atomic oxygen  arrival is isotropic. Additionally, the atomic oxygen energy of a plasma asher is much lower  (\uf0bb0.04 eV) than the atomic oxygen energy in LEO (\uf0bb4.5 eV). Furthermore, samples in a plasma  asher receive an intense amount of UV radiation, whereas samples in LEO receive many  different types of radiation, including broad spectrum UV radiation, electron and proton  radiation, and solar flare x-rays. The plasma in ashers, operating on air as a feed gas, includes  diatomic nitrogen, diatomic oxygen and oxygen ions, along with monatomic nitrogen and  monatomic oxygen in both excited and ground-energy states. However, ground-state atomic  oxygen is the predominant species of the LEO environment (NASA-TM-X-74335). All of these  exposure differences may affect the rate of degradation of materials. As a consequence, the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of a polymer measured in an RF plasma asher can be significantly  different than that measured in LEO. Studies have been conducted to try to understand the effects  of various factors in ground test facilities on the erosion yields of certain polymers. For example,  Miller et al. (2008) conducted a series of experiments to isolate UV radiation and charged  species during atomic oxygen exposure of PE, Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, and Kapton\uf0d2 HN, relative to  Kapton\uf0d2 H in a plasma asher (Miller et al., 2008). The same materials were also exposed to a  hyperthermal atomic oxygen beam (Miller et al., 2008). The results were found to vary with the  polymer and indicated that UV radiation, charged particle exposure, and beam energy affected  the erosion yields of FEP and PE but not of Kapton\uf0d2 HN, relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H.  n an effort to improve the accuracy of ground-based durability testing, ground-laboratory to in-  space atomic oxygen correlation experiments have been conducted. In these tests, the atomic  oxygen erosion yields of the PEACE Polymers were determined relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H, using an  RF plasma asher (operated on air). The asher erosion yields were compared to the MISSE 2  PEACE Polymers LEO erosion yields to determine the correlation between erosion rates in the  two environments (Stambler et al., 2009).  10. CORRELATION OF GROUND-LABORATORY DATA TO IN-  SPACE DATA   of film where possible) as the polymers used in the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight  experiment; therefore, they were a second set of control samples. Although stacked layers of  polymer films were flown in the MISSE 2 flight experiment, only single-layer film samples were  exposed in the plasma asher.            samples were vacuum-dehydrated for at least 48 hours before their masses were measured both  before and after atomic oxygen plasma exposure, as recommended by ASTM E 2089-00  (Stambler et al., 2009). The samples\u2019 dehydrated masses were obtained using a Mettler Balance  with a sensitivity of \u00b10.000001 g.     amples were exposed to an atomic oxygen environment in a Structure Probe, Inc., Plasma  Prep II asher. This asher generates a plasma by exciting ambient air with 100 W of continuous  RF power at 13.56 MHz (Gulino, 1986). The operating pressure was 6.67 to 13.33 Pa. The  plasma is composed of oxygen and nitrogen ions and atoms (Rutledge et al., 1994); the nitrogen  species have been found to have a negligible effect in the erosion processes (Rutledge et al.,  1986). The Kapton\uf0d2 H effective atomic oxygen fluence was calculated based on mass loss data  of dehydrated 127-\u03bcm (5-mil) Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide samples, which were ashed with the test  samples. Kapton\uf0d2 H is used as a standard material to measure effective fluence because the  erosion yield in LEO is well characterized. The atomic oxygen erosion yield for Kapton\uf0d2 H was  assumed to be 3.00\uf0b410-24 cm3/atom based on these data (ASTM E 2089-00).  ix samples were ashed together using a specially designed holder with six sample openings  (Figure 45, Sample Holder with Six Polymer Samples). The holder protected the edges and the  backs of the samples from the plasma, which kept the samples from curling during exposure and  provided a well-defined exposure area. The holder was always placed in the same position in the  asher in an effort to provide the same flux for each sample position. The sample positions are  indicated in Figure 45. A Kapton\uf0d2 H fluence witness sample was placed in position 1 for every  test so that the atomic oxygen effective fluence could be determined.                      positions relative to position 1. For these tests, Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples were in all six  positions. The effective flux was then determined for each position (based on dehydrated mass  loss). During the plasma asher exposures, to calculate the fluence to which each sample was  exposed during a test, the effective fluence was determined for the Kapton\uf0d2 H witness in  position 1, and then that fluence was multiplied by the factor for each position to get the fluence  for each sample position.  amples were exposed to Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluences ranging from 7.7\uf0b41019 to  2.2\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2\uf0d7sec. Details on the test procedures, including atomic oxygen flux tests,  exposure area measurements and results, and individual sample text exposures, are provided by  Stambler et al.

The Table also provides the asher to  in-space erosion yield ratios. All of the polymers had higher asher erosion yields than in-space  erosion yields. This is related to the many differences that exist between in-space and asher  exposure, as mentioned earlier.  ost of the ratios of asher-to-in-space erosion yield were between 1 and 3. According to this  table, it appears that PI (PMR-15) had an asher-to-in-space ratio of <1.0, but the asher erosion  yield (3.1\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom) was slightly higher than the in-space erosion yield  (\uf03e3.02\uf0b410-24 cm3/atom). Some of the fluoropolymers, such as amorphous fluoropolymer (AF),  PTFE, perfluoroalkoxy copolymer resin (PFA), and FEP, had significantly higher asher-to-in-  space ratios.  evlar\uf0d2 and white Tedlar\uf0d2 stand out as having ratios of 24.0 and 37.1, respectively, the highest  of all the samples. The high asher to in-space ratio for the Kevlar\uf0d2 sample is likely because of its  morphology: Kevlar\uf0d2 is a woven fabric, and atomic oxygen can attack a greater surface area per  atomic oxygen fluence in the asher than in LEO. The high asher to in-space ratio for the white  Tedlar\uf0d2 sample is likely a result of its white titanium dioxide pigment, which is atomic oxygen  durable. When the polymeric content of white Tedlar\uf0d2 erodes during atomic oxygen exposure, it  leaves a fine nonvolatile powder on the sample surface. This can shield the underlying polymer  from atomic oxygen attack. For the MISSE flight experiment, the atomic oxygen arrival was  primarily from the ram direction (normal to the polymer surface), and so the residual powder  appears to have formed a protective layer (if not disturbed). In the asher, however, where atomic  oxygen arrival is isotropic and at thermal energy (\uf0bb0.04 eV), the high atomic oxygen flux can get  underneath the protective particles and cause significantly greater erosion than in space. In  addition, the effective fluences for the asher tests were well below the in-space fluence of  8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2, which means that there was probably a higher density of atomic-oxygen-  durable pigment particles during the later phases of the in-space exposure. Therefore, the erosion  of white Tedlar\uf0d2 is substantially greater in the plasma asher than it is in space.

It is possible that the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of these polymers may decrease over time because more atomic-  oxygen-durable particles are exposed on the sample surface with increasing fluence, providing  increasingly greater protection of the underlying material. Therefore, it would be beneficial to  obtain atomic oxygen erosion yields of polymers in LEO from several missions of different               durations so that samples are exposed to several different LEO atomic oxygen fluences. In this  way, erosion yield dependence on fluence could be assessed for different polymers.    apparent that not all materials that form volatile oxidation products have the same erosion yield.  For example, hydrocarbon polymers that have a high fractional oxygen content, such as  polyoxymethylene (POM), tend to have higher erosion yields than those that have low fractional  oxygen content. Polymers that have high fractional fluorine content, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP and  PTFE, tend to have lower atomic oxygen erosion yields than those composed of hydrogen rather  than fluorine, such as PE. Although it is not clear the degree to which the type and number of  chemical bonds influence the probability of an atomic oxygen atom reacting, it is reasonable to  assume that there is some dependence of type and number of chemical bonds on atomic oxygen  erosion yield.    have a lower atomic oxygen erosion yield than a less dense material, such as polystyrene foam,  because it takes more oxygen atoms per square centimeter to oxidize a more dense material.  Polymers that contain high fractions of non-oxidizable content, such as ash or metal oxide  pigment particles, as does white Tedlar\uf0d2 polyvinyl fluoride, should have lower erosion yields  than polymers that have low ash contents, because the non-oxidizable particles can shield the  polymer from reacting with the oxygen atoms. Similarly, as an ash-containing polymer erodes  with time, an increasing proportion of the polymer surface becomes covered with ash, which  causes the erosion yield to drop with fluence. Thus, atomic oxygen fluence should be considered  a variable rather than a constant, because almost all polymers contain a small amount of non-  oxidizable ash.   atomic oxygen erosion yield data (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh  et al., 2006, ESA), polymer chemical structure information concerning the number and types of  chemical bonds, polymer density information, fractional ash content data, and atomic oxygen  fluence data (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2006, ESA;  Banks et al., 2008). Although other environmental factors in addition to atomic oxygen, such as  VUV radiation, ionizing radiation, and sample temperature, may have effects on the erosion  yield of materials, they were not included in this model because they were not variable in the  MISSE 2 experiment. The atomic oxygen predictive tool equation coefficients were sequentially  and iteratively adjusted to achieve the highest correlation coefficient between actual LEO results  and those of the predictive tool. Therefore, the physical properties and chemical structures  discussed above were used to develop a formula that provided the closest match between  predicted and actual erosion yields. The LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield data from MISSE 2  can be found in section 9.3.5 in this NASA Technical Handbook.          t is clear from the atomic oxygen erosion yield data from the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment, as well as from previous LEO flight experiments, that polymers with a significant  abundance of pendant fluorine and/or chlorine atoms, such as FEP and CTFE, had low atomic  oxygen erosion yields relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide in LEO. Conversely, polymers with  significant oxygen content in their backbone, such as POM, had much higher atomic oxygen  erosion yields. It is far less clear to what degree erosion yield depends on mixes of in-chain or  pendant oxygen, nitrogen, and benzyl rings or whether the bonding is single, double, or triple.  Therefore, many approaches were explored to correlate erosion yield with chemical structure, the  number of atoms of each type in a polymer repeat unit, and the number of bonds of each type  (single, double, or triple) in the polymer repeat unit.   ost polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material that does not become volatile upon  reaction with atomic oxygen. The residue that results after atomic oxygen exposure is called ash.  The presence of fragile remaining ash may account for some of the debris shown on some  samples in the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment post-flight photo in Figure 34. As atomic  oxygen erodes a polymer that contains inorganic material in LEO, the resulting nonvolatile ash  begins to accumulate on the eroded surface of the polymer, shielding the underlying polymer  from oxidation. As a result, a polymer\u2019s ash content can reduce its erosion yield. For example, as  previously stated, the titanium dioxide pigment particles in white polyvinyl fluoride (PVF-W,  white Tedlar\uf0d2) shield its surface, resulting in a very low erosion yield of 0.101\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom,  compared to the much higher erosion yield of 3.19\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom of clear Tedlar\uf0d2. The  protection of oxidized polymers is more dependent upon the volume fraction of ash than on the  mass fraction of ash because the surface coverage of ash plays a dominant role. However, it is  much easier to use the mass fraction of ash because it is very difficult to measure ash volume  unless you know the ash density.  determined experimentally for each of the 39 PEACE Polymers and pyrolytic graphite. Ash  content was defined as the fraction of the initial dehydrated polymer mass that was nonvolatile  and that remained after the polymer had been completely oxidized in an RF plasma asher. This  was accomplished by placing pieces of each polymer in thin Al foil cups and ashing them for  several hundred hours in an RF plasma asher operated on air until only ash remained (Banks et  al., 2009). The Al cups had been previously exposed to atomic oxygen to remove organic  coatings that typically reside on Al foil as a result of foil processing. Figure 46, SEM Images of  the Ash Remaining after Several Hundred Hours of RF Plasma Asher Air Plasma Exposure,  shows the ash remaining from white Tedlar\uf0d2 and PEO. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy revealed  the presence of titanium in the white Tedlar\uf0d2 ash, as expected because of the titanium dioxide  pigment particles, and the presence of a mix of metal elements in the ash from PEO.   densely packed atoms should have lower erosion yields than loosely packed atoms. Data on  polymer density were obtained from either the suppliers or density gradient column testing  (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2006, ESA).             Figure 46\u2014SEM Images of the Ash Remaining after Several Hundred Hours of RF Plasma  Asher Air Plasma Exposure  Unfortunately, a gradual buildup of inorganic contamination from the asher itself complicates the  process of determining ash content because the added mass from contaminants is observed as  additional ash. This buildup is especially prevalent if the ashing is continued long after the  organic portion of the polymer is completely oxidized. Additionally, materials with low erosion  yields tend to accumulate more contamination in the asher environment than those with high  erosion yields. Correcting for this contamination is problematic because it depends on the surface  area of the ash, which is difficult to measure.  he effect of ash content on erosion yield in an end Hall hyperthermal atomic oxygen facility  (Banks et al., 2006) was determined by measuring the erosion yield of five epoxy resin samples  that were purposely filled with various amounts of fumed silica. Epoxy resin with no added  fumed silica was found to also contain some ash, as indicated in Table 11, Ash Content of the  Five Samples used to Measure Erosion Yield Dependence on Mass Fraction Ash, as a result of  ashing samples of the cured epoxy. Additional ash, in the form of fumed silica, was weighed and  mixed with both parts of the uncured epoxy to achieve the total mass fraction ash (fraction of ash  in the polymer determined by the mass) indicated in Table 11, which was used to plot Figure 47,  Erosion Yield Dependence on Mass Fraction Ash in Epoxy for a Kapton\uf0d2 H Effective Fluence of  1.24\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2.

It was necessary to use  hyperthermal rather than thermal energy atomic oxygen attack because thermal energy atomic  oxygen is not greatly attenuated (compared to LEO hyperthermal atomic oxygen) in reaction  probability as a result of arrival on ash surfaces. Because particle-filled epoxy resins tend to have  a resin-rich surface, all the samples were abraded before atomic oxygen exposure to ensure that  the exposed surfaces were representative of the bulk material.    atoms/cm2 is shown in Figure 47.

An approximation of this ash-shielding dependence on fluence was determined by  modeling the erosion yield of white Tedlar\uf0d2 in hyperthermal atomic oxygen environments for the  low-fluence end Hall test and the high-fluence MISSE 2 LEO exposure, as shown in  Figure 49, Erosion Yield Ash Attenuation Constant (K) as a Function of Fluence (F). In this  Figure, the erosion yield for the end Hall test was corrected to account for the differences           between the Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluence of the end Hall exposure and in-space exposure using  the ratio between Kapton\uf0d2 H and white Tedlar\uf0d2 erosion yields for both environments.       with a power law dependence, which implies that, if the fluence doubles, the attenuation constant  is slightly less than doubled. This is reasonable, because the buildup of ash on the surface of a  polymer, which causes the attenuation, occurs faster at low fluences.  dditional erosion yield dependencies were considered for the predictive model, including  physical density (\uf072 (g/cm3)). Also considered was the packing density of atoms (V\uf053\uf02fVr), which  relates to how densely the atoms could theoretically be packed in comparison to the actual  volume of the repeat unit, where larger spaces would occur between atoms because of van der  Waals bonding or void spaces. The minimum volume of the atoms that make up a polymer  repeat unit (V\uf053) was based on the sum of the atoms making up the polymer repeat unit, assuming  each atom\u2019s volume to be determined by its covalent radii.  he actual volume of each repeat unit (Vr) was determined based on the chemical structure of the  repeat unit as well as the molecular weight and density of the material. Thus, for a ratio of V\uf053\uf02fVr  of much less than 1, the polymer\u2019s erosion yield would be higher than that of a similarly  structured polymer with tightly packed atoms. Values of V\uf053\uf02fVr are given in Banks et al., (2008).                              ver 100 different equations were tested using the information in the previous section to  determine a formula that had a high correlation coefficient (R2) with the actual LEO erosion  yield data. An initial erosion yield model (Banks et al., 2008) produced a correlation coefficient  of 0.914. That model used an assumption of linear dependency and made extensive use of  information about the bonding of atoms in a repeat unit (Banks et al., 2008). However, the  equation for that model produced negative erosion yields for some polymers that were not flown  as part of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment.  11.3 Single Organic Material Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive Model (2009  Version)  o correct this problem, an alternative approach (the September 2009 version) was pursued; this  version used the dependency variables (such as atomic populations per repeat unit) as exponents  with appropriate constants to optimize the correlation coefficient. This concept used weighted  exponents rather than weighted additive terms. It allowed for dependency on the numbers and  types of chemical bonds, polymer density information, and fractional ash content data and  atomic oxygen fluence, while preventing negative erosion yield values. It enabled significant  simplification of the predictive equation with very little loss in the correlation coefficient from  the September 2009 version (Banks et al., 2009; Banks et al., 2011).   2 PEACE Polymers data. The resulting equation used atomic populations in the repeat unit as  well as physical density, packing density, ash content, and the number of single and double  oxygen bonds in the repeat unit.

The flight  experiment materials were selected specifically to represent a variety of polymers used in space  and a wide variety of chemical structures. The September 2009 predictive tool utilizes the  chemical structure, atomic populations of the polymer repeat unit, oxygen bonding information,  and physical properties, such as density and ash content, that can be measured in ground  laboratory tests. The prediction does not require the use of asher erosion yield information. The  tool has a correlation coefficient of 0.895 and an uncertainty of \uf0b11.27\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom when  compared with actual MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers space data (for 38 polymers and pyrolytic  graphite). One polymer, PEO, was found to be significantly off the linear fit and so was not used  in the predictive tool equation. The predictive tool does appear to predict reasonable atomic  oxygen erosion yields, even for those polymers for which the previous predictive process yielded  negative erosion yield values. The tool also allows for the prediction of atomic oxygen erosion  yields as a function of fluence, which is relevant for polymers with high fractional ash contents.  The purpose of the predictive tool is to enable estimations of LEO atomic oxygen erosion yields  for new polymers and composites without expensive and time-consuming in-space testing.      owever, because the erosion yield may be fluence dependent if the polymer contains ash or a  non-oxidizable pigment, the thickness of the material that is eroded is not simply proportional to  the fluence. The erosion yield must be calculated for the specific fluence being considered. This  can be accomplished if the following are known: the fluence, the ash content of the material, and  the dependence on erosion yield of the ash content of the polymer as discussed in section 11 of  this NASA Technical Handbook. Polymers with high fractional ash content typically show  greater erosion yield dependence than polymers with low ash content.  ome polymers, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, have been found to exhibit an erosion yield dependence  on ESH (de Groh, K. K. and Banks, B.A., Atomic Oxygen Erosion Data From the MISSE 2-8  Missions, NASA TM-2019-219982, May 2019), as shown in Figure 51, Erosion Yield versus  Solar Exposure (ESH) for TeflonTM FEP Flown on Various Missions. This may be related to  Once the atomic oxygen erosion yield for a polymer has been determined by experiment or  predictive modeling, the expected thickness loss (X) is given by:                  greater volatility of oxidized polymer scission fragments on the surface, the number of which  gradually increases with VUV exposure.

However, at angles near and beyond 90\uf0b0 from the ram direction, the flux  of atomic oxygen is higher than that predicted by cosine losses. That is because the fluence  beyond 90\uf0b0 is related to the velocity vector contributions caused by the Maxwell Boltzman  distribution of the atomic oxygen velocities, spacecraft orbital inclination, and the co-rotation of  the thermosphere. If a spacecraft is spinning with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the orbital  plane, then the average flux to any surface that is perpendicular to that plane is simply 1/\uf070 of that  of the ram direction. If the spacecraft is rotating in random directions, then the average flux is  1/4 that of the ram flux.

Therefore, the  polysiloxane and/or fiberglass-containing composite is evaluated for ash content just as any other  polymer would be. However, the ash content for this material is substantially larger than for a  pure (neat) hydro- or halocarbon polymer. As a consequence, the erosion yield is lower than for a  neat polymer, matrix, carbon-fiber composite. In addition, the erosion yield of this material  decreases with fluence as the surface becomes more and more protected by the oxides that  remain on the surface after erosion of the hydrocarbon components of the composite. Ash  content, in terms of fractional mass ash, can be most effectively determined by taking weight  loss measurements of filings of composite samples and ashing them in an RF plasma asher. This  provides a representative sampling of the fiber and matrix components of the composite. The  resulting fractional mass ash is then substituted into the predictive erosion yield equation.  the entire material volume because the carbon-fiber-fill fraction may vary throughout the  composite. For example, the surface of a carbon-fiber-filled organic matrix composite may have  a greater volume fraction of matrix material than deep within the bulk. Foam (open- or closed-  pore) materials also have a higher erosion yield than their denser versions. The erosion yield of  the polymer component of the foam material is simply the erosion yield of a fully dense polymer,     \uf072  \uf072   =  f =  the density of the fully dense polymer  the density of the foam polymer.         y  \uf072  f           but the erosion yield of the pores component is infinity, because it does not take any oxygen  atoms to erode through a pore. Therefore, using the rule of mixtures based on the erosion yields  of each material erroneously predicts an infinite erosion yield of the mixed material.  owever, the rule of mixtures based on the erosion resistance and volume fraction of each  material predicts a correct erosion yield for the mixture. The erosion resistance is simply the  inverse of the erosion yield, a concept similar to the addition of electrical resistors in parallel to  obtain the overall resistance. Therefore, the erosion resistance of the mixed materials (ER) is as  follows:      Ey = atomic oxygen erosion yield of the mixed material (cm3/atom)  Ff = fractional volume of fibers in the composite  Fp = fractional volume of polymer in the composite  ERf = atomic oxygen erosion resistance of fibers (atoms/cm3)  ERp = atomic oxygen erosion resistance of polymer matrix (atoms/cm3).   he ash content of a carbon-fiber-based hydrocarbon matrix composite can be evaluated by  ashing samples (typically filings) of the material. This allows the matrix polymer and fiber  components of the composite to contribute in proper proportions to the measured ash content. If  the polymer matrix material is a co-polymer that contains polysiloxanes, then the erosion yield  for that polymer, which takes into account its ash content, should be used in the above formula.   oxygen to propagate through their thickness, thus allowing for potential interaction with  underlying materials. Data comparing the fractional flux being transmitted, i.e., fractional open  area, for individual materials are currently not available, but the fractional flux would be  dependent on the details of the fabric geometry, thickness, and atomic oxygen arrival impact   Eyf = erosion yield of the fibers in the composite  Eyp = erosion yield of the polymer in the composite.        1  E    EF  \uf0d7  f    EF  \uf0d7  p                         angle. In addition, atomic oxygen that did pass through the fabric would be trapped and produce  an erosion yield beyond what would be based on the fractional open area of the fabric.    for thermal-control surfaces such as multilayer insulation blanket layers, and for lightweight  structural components. The atomic oxygen durability of such components is critical to mission  reliability and performance, and knowledge of the durability of typical spacecraft materials and  anticipated materials is crucial to spacecraft design considerations. To address this need, LEO  spaceflight experiment data were obtained, along with space environment data, ground-  laboratory analyses, and predictive modeling to provide atomic oxygen erosion yield predictions  for current and future spacecraft polymers.   the LEO space environment on the exterior of the ISS for 3.95 years as part of MISSE 2. The  objective of this experiment was to accurately determine the atomic oxygen erosion yields of a  wide variety of polymeric materials after long-term exposure to the space environment. The  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment (flown on MISSE 2, Tray 1, sample Tray E5) was exposed  to ram atomic oxygen, along with solar and charged-particle radiation. Mass loss was determined  to be the best technique for characterizing the atomic oxygen erosion yield values for this  experiment because, for some samples, erosion occurred through several layers at once, resulting in  a cone\u2013and-valley formation; for others, some sample layers were left as fragile gossamer films.  experiment based on mass loss measurements obtained from pre-flight and post-flight vacuum-  dehydrated samples. Exposure areas were determined based on post-flight measurements of each  individual flight sample\u2019s tray exposure opening. Density values for 36 of the 41 polymers were  obtained using calibrated density gradient columns; the densities of the other 5 samples were  obtained from referenced literature or manufacturers\u2019 MSDSs. The atomic oxygen fluence for  the experiment was calculated based on two Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples. (No significant  difference in atomic oxygen fluence was found between the technique of back-extrapolation of  the mass data to time zero to get a theoretically dehydrated mass and the technique of using the  average mass values.) The average atomic oxygen fluence for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment was determined to be 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2. As some samples may have experienced  a synergistic effect of solar exposure with atomic oxygen erosion, it is important to note that the  solar exposure for Tray E5 was computed to be approximately 6,300 ESH. There was partial or  complete full-thickness erosion of 6 of the 41 flight samples; therefore, because the mass loss  would likely have been greater had more material been flown, the erosion yield values for these  samples are greater than the values reported. Planning for a 3-year exposure (as opposed to the  anticipated 1 year) was found to be crucial to the success of this experiment because of the  unexpectedly long mission duration (3.95 years).   t is also important to know how accurate the atomic oxygen erosion yield data are. To address  this, the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental erosion yield value was calculated using equations  for fractional uncertainty derived from the equations used to compute erosion yield. Because         three different post-flight sample-weighing procedures were used, three different equations were  derived for determining the fractional uncertainty of the erosion yield values. The uncertainty  and fractional uncertainty in erosion yield for each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples  have been determined; the average fractional standard deviation uncertainties in erosion yield  were very small: \u00b13.30 percent.   well-characterized polymers flown in LEO for a long duration under identical conditions. In  addition, this experiment was exposed to an environment with unusually little contamination.  Therefore, the atomic oxygen erosion yield data from this LEO flight experiment provide  extremely valuable information for spacecraft design and predictive model development  purposes.  n addition to documenting the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield values of the MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers, this NASA Technical Handbook reviews background information on the LEO atomic  oxygen environment, atomic oxygen interaction with materials, ground-laboratory-to-in-space  correlation data for the PEACE Polymers in an RF plasma asher, an atomic oxygen erosion yield  predictive tool developed at NASA GRC based on the PEACE Polymers flight data, and tools for  using atomic oxygen erosion yield data for spacecraft durability predictions. In addition,  appendices in this NASA Technical Handbook review the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers atomic  oxygen erosion yield error analyses (Appendix B), review optical and thermal data for the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers (Appendix C), provide individual summary pages for each of the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (Appendix D), and provide an overview of lessons learned  from experiments investigating atomic oxygen interaction with spacecraft materials in LEO  (Appendix E).

This NASA Technical Handbook was supported by the ISS Research and MISSE-X  Projects and the NASA Technical Standards Program.           n any experiment, it is critical to determine the accuracy of the data obtained. To address this for  the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental LEO  erosion yield value was calculated using equations for fractional uncertainty derived from the  equation used to find erosion yield (McCarthy et al., 2010). The specific equations developed  and resulting erosion yield uncertainties are provided in this appendix, which is based on the  error analysis conducted by McCarthy et al. (2010).           APPENDIX B: MISSE 2 PEACE POLYMERS EXPERIMENT  ATOMIC OXYGEN EROSION YIELD ERROR ANALYSIS    \u0394M = mass loss (g)  \u03c1  D = the exposed diameter of the polymer (cm)  F    well-established erosion yield in LEO: 3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom (ASTM E 2089-00). The atomic  oxygen fluence for these samples can be calculated by solving Eq. B-1 for F and using the  Kapton\uf0d2 H mass loss and density values. The fluence was based on the frontal exposed area of  each sample. It is believed that the 45\u00b0-slanted edges of the Al sample holders contributed to a  slight increase in fluence around the perimeters of the samples, causing some samples to erode  through around the edge only; however, since this was the case for all of the samples, no further  calculations needed to be done to correct for this anomalous effect.     \uf044\uf0d7  \uf0d7  M  2  FD  \uf0d7                   ractional uncertainty, also called relative uncertainty or percent error, is a way of quantifying  error. In this investigation, the fractional uncertainty represents the fractional standard deviation  of the values and is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the value by the value itself.  The general equation for fractional uncertainty in atomic oxygen erosion yield is as follows:    s previously mentioned, each flight sample included two sets of sample layers: Part A was  enough material to theoretically last for 1.5 years in space, and the additional layers of Part B  extended the time to 3 years, as shown in Figure 52, Illustration of the Flight Sample Setup. Each  flight sample also had a corresponding identical backup sample, including both Parts A and B,  that was kept on the ground as a control. Though flight sample Parts A and B were not separated  during flight, they were separated for pre- and post-flight weighing. Because of mission time  constraints, Part B of each sample was not weighed pre-flight, and so a theoretical value for the  pre-flight mass of Part B was calculated: the pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A (MF) and the  pre-flight mass of control sample Part A (MC) were used to calculate the average mass per layer  (MA), which was multiplied by the number of layers (n) in flight sample Part B to get Part B\u2019s  theoretical pre-flight mass (n\u00b7MA).   E =  xi =  the atomic oxygen erosion yield  the ith variable in the equation for erosion yield.         \uf064\uf0d7  x    1  E   \uf0e5  i                  here were three different situations for post-flight sample weighing, so three different equations  to determine mass loss were required. Mass loss (\u0394M) is a factor in calculating the erosion yield  of a polymer (see Eq. B-1), and so it was also necessary to develop three different equations for  fractional uncertainty in erosion yield. The different mass loss equations were simply substituted  into the equation for erosion yield, and then, from each of the three resulting equations, an  equation for fractional uncertainty was derived to calculate the percent error for that situation.  In Situation 1, either only one sample layer was flown or the atomic oxygen eroded through only  some of the layers in flight sample Part A and all of flight sample Part B was still pristine (Figure  53, Illustration of Situation 1 Sample Erosion).  Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B  Partially  eroded  through     ecause flight sample Part A and flight sample Part B were weighed separately pre-flight, in this  situation only Part A needed to be weighed post-flight and compared with its pre-flight mass; so  to minimize error, the terms for pre- and post-flight mass for flight sample Part B were omitted  from the Situation 1 mass loss equation:      =   \u2212  \uf0a2  F  Flight Sample  Part A  (enough layers to  survive 1.5 yr)  Flight Sample  Part B  (enough  additional layers  to survive  a total of 3 yr)  Pre-Flight  (pristine)                  n Situation 2, atomic oxygen erosion occurred through all of the layers of flight sample Part  A and through some of the layers of flight sample Part B (Figure 54, Illustration of Situation 2  Sample Erosion).  Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B   In this situation, flight sample Parts A and B were able to be separated for post-flight  weighing. However, because flight sample Part B had not been weighed pre-flight, its  theoretical pre-flight mass was used. Therefore, the Situation 2 equation for mass loss is:    MF and  n\u00b7MA   =   =   =  the pre- and post-flight mass values, respectively, of flight sample Part A  the theoretical pre-flight mass of flight sample Part B  the post-flight mass of Part B.   MF =   =   the pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A  the post-flight mass of Part A.

However, for five other samples  (PE, ADC, PMMA, polyetherimide (PEI), and PMR-15), atomic oxygen did, in some places,  erode through all layers. For these six samples, therefore, the calculated erosion yields are less  than the actual erosion yields, because the mass loss would have been greater had there had been  more material. These six erosion yield values are highlighted in Table 21. Since the samples in  these cases appeared to have eroded partially or completely through at a fluence level close to the  full mission fluence, the measured erosion yields of these samples were still included in the data  set as estimates to develop a predictive erosion yield equation (Banks et al., 2009). These  samples have been reflown in LEO for actual erosion yield determination as part of the Stressed  PEACE Polymers experiment on MISSE 6 (de Groh et al., 2008, JAXA).   of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (McCarthy et al., 2010). The highest fractional  uncertainty was for PA 66 (\u00b112.59 percent), and the lowest fractional uncertainty was for  ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) (\u00b12.56 percent). The average fractional uncertainty in  erosion yield was very small: \u00b13.30 percent.  *Darker blue cells indicate calculated erosion yields are less than the actual erosion yields.

NASA  GRC: Cleveland, OH                his Appendix provides details on the optical and thermal properties of the MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers experiment after 4 years of space exposure, as documented in Waters et al., (2009).     and thermal property degradation of spacecraft materials, changes in the optical and thermal  properties of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples as a result of LEO exposure have been  analyzed and compared with control samples to determine the extent of change on orbit.  otal and diffuse reflectance and total and diffuse transmittance were measured as a function of  wavelength and were compared with the corresponding values of non-exposed control samples.  Specular reflectance and specular transmittance were then computed. Thermal emittance data  were also generated. The wavelength-dependent data also allow for computation of the change in  solar absorptance and in thermal emittance, both of which are critical for predicting  thermal-control characteristics of a spacecraft.  any of the MISSE PEACE Polymer samples were comprised of several layers so as to survive  a 3-year LEO exposure. Because the mission was 3.95 years in duration, many of the polymers  were eroded through several layers; several were eroded through all layers in some places; and  one sample was completely eroded away. Therefore, it was determined that the best way to  measure the optical and thermal properties of the flight samples was to determine which layers of  each sample should be measured, based on the erosion pattern, and then to compare the same  number of layers of the control flight sample. If a sample was partially eroded, the layer or layers  that experienced partial erosion (rather than full erosion, as was the case with the layers above  partially eroded layers) along with the intact layer immediately underneath were analyzed, and  the control sample included the same number of layers, as shown in Figure 56, Schematic  Diagram of MISSE 2 Flight Sample Layer Erosion and the Corresponding Control Layers used  for Optical and Thermal Property Measurements. If the top layers would be damaged by  separation, the sample was left as a whole, and an equal number of control sample layers were  used for analysis.

(See Figure 57, Sample Holder for Optical and Thermal Measurements.) The front of  the sample holder recessed the sample by 0.013 cm, and the back of the holder allowed for a  cavity of up to 0.305 cm, depending on sample thickness.   Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrophotometer was used to measure TR, DR, TT, and DT from  250 to 2500 nm. The instrument is equipped with a 15-cm Spectralon integrating sphere, shown  in Figure 58, Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 Spectrophotometer with Closeup of Integrating Sphere.  The SR and ST were calculated using the difference between total and diffuse values.  Absorptance data (1 \u2013 (reflectance + transmittance)) were integrated with respect to the air mass  zero solar spectrum to obtain \u03b1s. A Labsphere-certified Spectralon standard was used for  calibration. The beam size was checked for each of the samples to verify that optical alignment  was correct.

The equipment has a sample aperture  diameter of 1.27 cm. Automatic integration of infrared reflectivity with respect to blackbody  curves is used to calculate total \u03b5 for a user-selectable temperature range. Data were obtained at  200 K, 300 K, 400 K, 500 K, and 573 K. The samples were placed in the sample holder shown in  Figure 57 and were backed by a Gier Dunkle gold standard. The samples had to be placed upside  down on the instrument over an aperture opening and so needed to be mechanically stable  enough to remain stationary and not fall into the instrument during the 3.5-minute scan. Several  samples could not be analyzed because of mechanical instability.    efore thermal measurement of all the samples, a test was conducted to evaluate the effect of  using the sample holder on the resulting \u03b5 value. Pristine Kapton\uf0d2 H (127 \uf06dm thick) was first  measured directly on the instrument backed with a gold standard and then measured in the  sample holder with the gold standard backing the holder. Table 22, Kapton\uf0d2 Thermal Emittance                 Values with and without a Holder, shows the results of these measurements. There is a slight  increase in \u03b5 that is attributable to the sample holder, but the sample holder was needed to  minimize sample handling and to best preserve the delicate surface texture of the flight samples.  This difference will be more noticeable for transparent thin-film, transparent samples than for  thicker or opaque samples. Because of the interference of the sample holder, the thermal \u03b5 values  were not interpreted as absolute \u03b5 values and were used instead as more of a comparison tool.

These included PE (2-E5-9), PMMA (2-E5-16), PA 66 (2-E5-28), PI  (CP1, 2-E5-29), PBI (2-E5-35), and PET (2-E5-38). The samples too damaged to be mounted  upside down over the aperture opening on SOC 400T included PS (2-E5-15), PBO (2-E5-18),  and PPPA (2-E5-24).    ost-retrieval and control optical measurements, including TR, DR, TT, and DT, were taken of  the remaining samples and are listed in Table 23, Post-Retrieval and Control Optical Properties  Integrated from 250 to 2,500 nm. The calculated of the SR, ST, and \u03b1s values are also listed in  Table 23. The number of layers measured is also shown for each sample. Figure 60,  Absorptance, Total Reflectance, Total Transmittance, and Emittance Spectral Data for Flight and  Control Samples, provides the spectral data of \u03b1s, TR, and TT for each material and its  corresponding control sample.

TR generally increased at least slightly  with exposure; exceptions were mainly the fluorinated polymers and pyrolytic graphite. The DR  showed a significant increase with exposure for most materials because of surface texturing;  notable exceptions were PBO, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), PPPA, pyrolytic graphite, and  PTFE. SR decreased with exposure for every sample measured, also because of surface  texturing, with the exception of PMR-15. PMR-15 had an eroded hole, which may have affected  its SR value. TT decreased with exposure for most samples measured, with the exceptions of  PBO, PPPA, and PTFE. DT increased significantly with exposure for most materials, but this  trend had many exceptions (PVF-W, POM, PEO, EP, PBT, polyurethane (PU), polycarbonate  (PC), and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). ST decreased with exposure for every sample with the  exceptions of PPPA and PTFE. With the exceptions of PPD-T, PMR-15, and PTFE, \u03b1s increased  with exposure.  emittance data over the wavelength range of 2 to 25 \u00b5m at various temperatures, as well as the  number of layers measured. Many of the \u03b5 values remained similar before and after space  exposure. Several materials, e.g., PU, FEP, and PTFE, experienced a decrease in \u03b5, possibly  caused by differences in thickness between the flight sample and the control sample. Many  materials showed an increase in \u03b5, most likely because of the development of cone structures on  the surface of the materials. PG showed the largest increase in \u03b5, along with the development of  a black velvet appearance after space exposure. Other samples that showed increased \u03b5 values  included POM, polyacrylonitrite (PAN), PEO, EP, PP, polysulfone (PSU), PEI, PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2),  PI (Kapton\uf0d2 H), and PEEK. It should be noted that the samples were all measured in the sample  holder, which was not flush with the SOC 400T face (there was a 0.013-cm gap) in an effort to  not damage the surface morphology. The gold standard used as a backing material for the  measurements was also separated from the sample by a 0.013-cm gap. Therefore, the values  obtained should not be interpreted as absolute values and should be used instead as a comparison  tool. Figure 60 provides graphs of the \u03b5 data for each material and its control sample.

The majority of the PEACE Polymer  samples were comprised of numerous thin-film layers stacked together. Because the MISSE 2  mission was much longer (3.95 years) than planned (1 year), one sample was completely eroded  away (PBI), and several other samples were severely degraded. Therefore, optical and thermal  measurements could not be obtained for all samples. Optical properties of 43 flight samples and  thermal properties of 40 flight samples were obtained and compared to those of the  corresponding control samples. Several trends were observed in the data. For most samples, SR  and DR characteristics changed greatly upon directed LEO atomic oxygen exposure; typically,  there was a decrease in SR and an increase in DR. These optical property changes affect glare  issues, Fresnel lens photovoltaic concentrator power loss issues, and issues with spatial  variations in the thermal load on a spacecraft. The wavelength-dependent data allowed for  computation of the changes in \u03b1s and thermal \uf065\uf02c which are critical data for predicting the thermal  control characteristics of a spacecraft. Because many of the PEACE Polymers are commonly  used for spacecraft applications, it is very important to understand potential changes in their  optical and thermal properties after long-term space exposure.   aters, D.L.; de Groh, K.K.; Banks, B.A.; Cameron, K.C.

APPENDIX E: LESSONS LEARNED FROM ATOMIC OXYGEN  INTERACTION WITH SPACECRAFT MATERIALS IN LOW  EARTH ORBIT   s a result of post-retrieval analyses of early MISSE experiments and space experiments such as  LDEF, valuable lessons have been learned and needs identified that are worthy of documentation  for use in the planning, design, and analysis of future space environment experiments. Some of  these lessons involve techniques, concepts, and issues associated with measuring atomic oxygen  erosion yields.  his appendix represents a collection of lessons with respect to atomic oxygen interactions  resulting from a variety of space experiments, as well as retrieved spacecraft materials and  components, such as from NASA\u2019s LDEF, NASA\u2019s EOIM III experiment, the Russian Space  Station Mir, NASA\u2019s MISSE 2, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s (JAXA\u2019s) Service  Module/Micro-Particles Capturer & Space Environment Exposure Device (SM/MPAC &  SEED), and the Hubble Space Telescope (Banks et al., 2008). These are presented, along with  several issues to be considered when designing experiments, such as uncertainty in mission  duration, scattering and contamination effects on results, and the accuracy of measuring atomic  oxygen erosion. The collective experiences from these LEO flights provide useful considerations  for future experiments that involve atomic oxygen interaction with materials. The objective of  this appendix is to explain and capture these experiences to benefit the quality of future  spacecraft experiments and missions.     ritten instructions and procedures should be used for preparing, assembly, mounting, testing  and examination, or testing of coupon substrate and coated samples for flight experiments. Good  research practices, which provide repeatable results at the level of credibility requisite for space  flight hardware, should be used. Materials, processes, equipment, and systems are required to be  designed, procured, fabricated, assembled, tested, and inspected in accordance with Agency-,  program-, and project-specific quality assurance requirements.  Occasionally, written instructions and procedures for mounting and assembly of space flight  hardware are not followed closely by those who are tasked with final installation. An example of  this is the experience of one of the authors regarding an experiment on EOIM-III involving a  pinhole camera. The cover on the experiment contained a small hole that was to act as a lens for  the camera, and a written note was provided in the installation instructions with a warning to           \u201cnot remove the cover of the Pinhole Camera which contains the pinhole;\u201d however, post-flight  inspection of the Shuttle cargo bay containing the experiment revealed that the cover had in fact  been removed before flight and then had been reattached after removal of the hardware from the  cargo bay. Because the cover was reattached after removal from the Shuttle cargo bay, it  appeared to have been on during flight. The experiment was a total failure as a result of the  cover\u2019s removal before flight. High-resolution images of experiments taken just after launch can  help validate proper installation. Pictures taken at various time intervals throughout the duration  of the experiment can also provide valuable information about experiment function and material  degradation.      than initially planned because of a variety of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at the  time the experiments are being developed. Table 25, Comparison of Planned and Actual Mission  Durations, lists the planned and actual mission durations for four missions in which experiment  retrievals were accomplished (O\u2019Neal and Lightner, 1991; Silverman, 1995; Banks et al., 1993;  Pippin, 2006). The average mission lasted 2.63 times longer than initially planned.   Mission  LDEF  EURECA*  MISSE 1-2  MISSE 3-4  Planned Duration (yr) Actual Duration (yr) Ratio of Actual/Planned  5.75  0.89  3.95  1.04  1  0.83  1-1.5  1  5.75  1.07  2.64  1.04   the experiment so that the thicknesses of the samples used for atomic oxygen erosion yield  testing were three times thicker than what was needed to survive the original planned mission  duration (1 year), based on estimated erosion yields. This procedure resulted in 85 percent of the  material samples surviving the mission, which lasted four times longer than initially planned (de  Groh et al., 2008).   he lesson learned is to design experiments to survive a considerably longer duration \u2014 at least  three times longer than the planned mission duration \u2014 to ensure that meaningful results will be  obtained, even if the mission duration is significantly longer than planned. For example, multiple  layers of thin-film polymers can be stacked together rather than one single layer being flown.  ilicones that have not been vacuum-stripped frequently contain short-chain molecules that are  volatile and readily transported onto neighboring surfaces. Vacuum stripping consists of vacuum            removal of the short-chain, highly volatile components of the polymer before polymerization.  When these contaminated spacecraft surfaces are exposed to atomic oxygen in LEO, the  silicones oxidize to form silica (or silicates). Hydrocarbons can also be trapped on the surface  during this process. The resulting deposit can form an atomic-oxygen-protective coating that can  darken as a result of solar radiation exposure. Evidence of the consequence of silicone  contamination could be seen on selected samples flown on LDEF, as shown in Figure 61, Post-  Flight Photograph of Solar Array Materials Passive LDEF Experiment AO171, where several  samples outgassed volatile silicones (Banks et al, 1991). The photograph shows silicone RTV-  511 samples, the lighter color samples within the blue-bordered area. These samples were  exposed to an atomic oxygen fluence of 7.17\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2, with the atoms arriving from the  upper left at an angle of 38\uf0b0 from normal incidence. Some of the volatile silicone deposits on the  sample holder plate became oxidized by atomic oxygen. These became fixed on the surface and  darkened with UV radiation exposure. Where the volatile silicones were deposited and not  exposed to atomic oxygen, they gradually re-evaporated, and no darkening resulted, hence, the  light boundary to the right of the samples, shown in the enlarged picture.  Figure 61\u2014Post-Flight Photograph of Solar Array Materials Passive LDEF Experiment  AO171  n November 1997, Russian cosmonauts retrieved a non-articulating, foldable panel solar array  from the Mir core module after 10.4 years in LEO and returned it for an international cooperative  analysis (Visentine et al., 1999; Banks et al., 1999). The solar array panels included a clad  structure of solar cells, fiberglass scrim, cover glasses, optical solar reflectors, and an open-  weave organic fabric coated with BF-4 adhesive. Silicone adhesives and thread sutures were  used to clad the solar array structure together. Over time, volatile silicones (evolved from the  suture holes surrounding the solar cells on both sides of the solar array) became deposited on the  surface of the array. Figure 62, Oxidized Silicone Contamination on Solar Cell Components  from a Mir Solar Array Retrieved after 10.4 years in LEO, shows photographs of the silica  deposits on the front and back of Mir solar cells resulting from atomic oxygen oxidization of the  silicone adhesives that had been transported in the gaseous phase onto neighboring surfaces. The  thick contamination appears as a white diffuse deposit. On the front surface of the array, the               oxidized silicone contamination was up to 4.6 \u00b5m thick near suture sites (Figure 62(a)). On the  back surface of a solar reflector, a tape peel test was conducted (see the two black stripes at the  upper right corner of Figure 62(b)), which revealed that the contaminant layer was between 1.06  and 1.24 \u00b5m thick.  (a) Front surface of solar array with  contamination up to 4.6 \u03bcm thick near  suture sites  (b) Back surface of a solar reflector with  contaminants between 1.06 and 1.24 \u03bcm thick at tape  peel site  Figure 59\u2014Oxidized Silicone Contamination on Solar Cell Components from a Mir Solar  Array Retrieved after 10.4 years in LEO  Although the solar array did not significantly degrade in performance from the silica  contamination, there was significant darkening of the optical solar reflector surfaces and  neighboring thermal-control white paint surfaces. This solar array technology was also used for  the Russian-supplied solar array for the ISS. Silicone deposition onto surfaces on the ISS from  hardware such as this may result in contamination that could affect atomic oxygen erosion and  solar absorptance.  able 26, Silica-Based Contamination on ISS Experiment Surfaces, shows the large variation in  silica-based contamination on surfaces from experiments placed at different locations on the ISS  (Dever et al, 2006; Steagall et al., 2008). The MISSE PEC 2 had two orders of magnitude less  contaminant thickness than the three JAXA experiment units (Dever 2006, Steagall 2008.) This  is probably related to differences in the total arrival of silicones based on each experiment\u2019s  respective view of, and distance from, contaminant sources on the ISS.                       Contaminant  Thickness(nm)  Duration of  Exposure (yr)  Contaminant  Thickness/Year (nm)     Unit 1, ram facing  Unit 2, ram facing  Unit 3, ram facing   30.0  75.0  93.5   0.863  2.37  3.84   34.8  31.7  24.3  experiment self-contamination. Experiments should also be out of the view of other sources of  silicone to be sure that atomic oxygen does not produce silica deposits that can affect erosion  yields or cause changes in solar absorptance.    t has long been suspected that some of the atomic oxygen arriving at a surface will scatter with  partial accommodation from surfaces with which the atomic oxygen reacts, as well as from non-  reactive surfaces, such as most metal oxides (Banks et al., 2002; Banks et al., 2003; Banks et al.,  2006). The scattered, un-reacted oxygen atoms can travel in a line-of-sight manner until they  encounter another surface, where they may react, recombine, or scatter again. This can occur  over thousands of meters. However, only recently have quantifiable scattering data been  available, from a small scattering chamber flown on MISSE 2. The experiment consisted of a  2.54-cm-diameter scattering chamber containing a SiO2-coated (on the ram-facing surface only)  polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H disk with a 3.05-mm-diameter aperture that allowed atomic oxygen to  enter the chamber. The atomic oxygen would then scatter off an Al disk and react with the  Kapton\uf0d2 on the bottom of the aperture disk. The bottom of the aperture disk was also coated in  many microscopic salt particles, which served as protective areas from scattered atomic oxygen  attack. Figure 63, MISSE 2 Atomic Oxygen Scattering Chamber Experiment, shows the  experiment setup, and Figure 64, Kapton\uf0d2 H Butte Remaining at Site of Protective Salt Particle,  shows a salt particle site. After the salt particles were washed off, the amount of atomic oxygen  erosion was measured as a function of ejection angle using profilometry. Although cosine (or  Lambertian) scattering had been expected, the results indicated that normal incident atomic  oxygen scattered in a rather narrow angular distribution, at approximately 45\uf0b0 from normal, as  shown in Figure 65, Atomic Oxygen Erosion as a Function of Ejection Angle. The scattered  atomic oxygen produced a surprisingly high effective erosion yield: 21.8 percent of that of ram  atomic oxygen for Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide (Banks et al., 2006).  he lesson learned is that atomic oxygen does not scatter in a cosine distribution or in a specular  direction but instead at 45\uf0b0 from normal for Al. This means that scattered atomic oxygen erosion  of materials must be considered, depending upon the particular geometry of a spacecraft.                                                         0.006   0.006      0.004   0.004  0.003   0.003     0.002   0.002     0.001   0.001   0.000   0.000   0.000  0.005   0.005        Incoming Atomic Oxygen                         sample trays with chamfered circular apertures can allow atomic oxygen to scatter from the  chamfered surfaces onto the samples, thus locally increasing the flux, as shown in Figure 66,  Flux Concentration from Chamfered MISSE Sample Holders. A consequence of the perimeter-  scattered atomic oxygen is that the erosion around the sample perimeter is greater than in the  central area. An example of this for measurements of the MISSE 2 PEACE PEO sample is  shown in Figure 67, Comparison of Pre- and Post-Flight Surface Profiles for the PEO Sample  (2-E5-17). If the atomic oxygen is arriving off normal, then there will be a variation in flux  around the perimeter of each sample depending on the scattering geometry. As can be seen in  Figure 68, MISSE 2 Tray 1 E5 Showing Samples Peeling up on Their Lower-Left Sides, two of  the MISSE 2 samples peeled up from their lower left edge, and atomic oxygen was found to be  arriving at 8\uf0b0 from normal and coming from the upper right direction. Therefore, there appears to  be a flux concentration near the perimeter of the samples from the atomic oxygen that impinged  upon the chamfered surface.     Figure 64\u2014Comparison of Pre- and Post-Flight Surface Profiles for the PEO Sample (2 E5  17)    Polymer   Aluminum  Preflight   Preflight   Preflight   Post flight   Post flight   Post flight   Not to scale                Figure 65\u2014MISSE 2 Tray 1 E5 Showing Two Samples Peeling up on Their Lower-Left  Sides   lip was 0.763 mm thick. The maximum possible additional fluence for 2.54-cm-diameter  samples caused by atomic oxygen scattering would be ~15 percent but, based on the previously  discussed scattering chamber experiments, is more likely ~3.3 percent. Therefore, the concern is  not a higher average fluence but rather sample peeling and potential release before full sample  erosion, which could lead to incorrect erosion yield calculations.   chamfer were used on the sample holders, which would prevent scattering of atomic oxygen onto  the sample surfaces. A potential disadvantage of this would be the loss of intimate contact at the  edge of the sample, which is used for profiling purposes, but this would not be a concern for  mass loss measurements.  he lesson learned is that sample holder chamfers can be a source of flux concentrations, which  can disproportionately erode the perimeters of samples and, in some cases, cause the samples to  roll up or potentially be released before full sample erosion. This problem could be eliminated by  using a reverse chamfer on the sample holder.                       nderstanding the exact orientation of atomic oxygen arrival and arrival of contaminants can be  very helpful in interpretation of environmental degradation results. Often, this information can be  determined if the orientation of samples is documented before their removal from experiment  trays. The exact orientation of the MISSE 2 atomic-oxygen-scattering chamber lid was  documented, which allowed for the determination that holes had been drilled as a result of  atomic oxygen arriving at 8\uf0b0 off-normal incidence and coming from the upper left of the  photograph in Figure 68 (Banks et al., 2006). This explained the preferential cutting out and  peeling of thin samples around the lower left perimeter, as shown in Figure 68.  E.3.6 Documentation of Sample Orientations with Respect to Atomic Oxygen Ram  Direction  he lesson learned is that critical information can be gained by either marking samples for  orientation or photo-documenting the experiment before sample removal to determine sample  orientation.   he time between retrieval of samples from space and ground-laboratory tensile testing can have  a significant impact on the elongation-to-failure results for FEP and possibly other polymers that  have been exposed to the LEO environment. For example, samples of 0.127-mm-thick silvered  FEP (Ag-FEP) retrieved from the wake side (rows 1 and 4) of the LDEF in January 1990 and  aluminized-FEP (Al-FEP) retrieved from the HST retrieved in December 1993 indicated a  significant reduction in elongation-to-failure as time progressed after the retrieval dates (Banks et  al.,1998; de Groh and Gummow, 2001), as shown in Figure 69, Reduction in Elongation-to-  Failure as a Result of Time after Retrieval for Ag-FEP and Al-FEP. Samples were taken from  near-neighbor locations in both cases. Interestingly, the reduction in elongation-to-failure  appears to continue long after radiation exposure occurs; this is thought to be caused by the  formation and presence of long-lived free radicals (Judeikis et al., 1968; Li et al., 2005).           Figure 66\u2014Reduction in Elongation-to-Failure as a Result of Time after Retrieval for Ag  FEP and Al FEP  Ground testing also indicated that storage of FEP samples in a vacuum slows the rate of tensile  property degradation (de Groh and Morgana, 2004). Polymer chain scission is believed to be  responsible for the degradation of FEP and is initiated by the impact of energetic electrons and  protons combined with thermal exposure (Townsend et al., 1999). Storing samples in air or  elevated temperatures increases degradation rates as compared to storage in vacuum or low  temperatures (Dever et al., 1999).  he lesson learned is that to properly evaluate radiation-induced tensile property damage in  thin-film polymers, it is important to store samples in vacuum and at low (room) temperatures  and to test them as soon as possible after retrieval. Use of multiple samples stored and tested  over time after retrieval may allow back-extrapolation to the in-space properties if the  degradation profile follows an exponential decay curve.    fact that cone-and-valley formation can result in erosion occurring through more than one  stacked polymer sheet, as seen in Figure 70, MISSE 2 PEEK Sample Stack Showing Partial  Erosion of the Fourth and Fifth Layers. Figure 71, Atomic Oxygen Texturing Occurring across  Two Layers of a Flight Stack of Polymer Samples, illustrates how the valleys between the cones  can extend into a lower sample layer by providing a pathway for atomic oxygen to erode the  layer below. This renders erosion yield measurement based on profilometry very inaccurate  because the erosion is through (at least) two separate layers.               Figure 70\u2014MISSE 2 PEEK Sample Stack Showing Partial Erosion of the Fourth and Fifth  Layers    Figure 71\u2014Atomic Oxygen Texturing Occurring across Two Layers of a Flight Stack of  Polymer Samples    ehydrated weight loss measurements can easily take this complication into account. Complete  dehydration of samples is very important to avoid weight inaccuracies related to variations in the  degree of absorbed water in the samples. However, for erosion yield determination based on  mass loss, the densities of the samples need to be accurately known, and this information is not  always readily available.           10micron   10micron              ost polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material. As atomic oxygen erodes a polymer  that contains inorganic material, the resulting nonvolatile ash begins to accumulate on the eroded  surface of the polymer. For high-fluence missions, such as the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment (for which the fluence was 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2) (de Groh et al., 2008), the  underlying polymer can gradually become somewhat shielded from reacting with atomic oxygen.  Therefore, it is theorized that a polymer\u2019s ash content has an effect on its erosion yield. Table 27,  Comparison of the Erosion Yields of Two Pairs of Chemically Similar Polymers with Different  Ash Contents, lists the erosion yields for two pairs of MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers that shared  similar chemical structures. The data (de Groh et al., 2008) show that, in spite of the similar  structures, the polymers\u2019 erosion yields differed, based largely on their ash content, which was  measured by weighing and then exposing samples of the polymers (held in small Al foil cups) to  atomic oxygen in an RF plasma asher until further weight loss occurred, which indicated that all  the polymer was oxidized and only ash remained.

These lessons include the following:  . Care should be taken to avoid experiment self-contamination and to place  experiments out of the view of sources of silicone to reduce the possibility that volatile silicone  deposits and atomic oxygen will react to produce silica deposits, which can affect erosion yields  and cause changes in solar absorptance.                        instead at 45\uf0b0 from normal for Al. This means that the geometry of the spacecraft, which may  lead to scattered atomic oxygen erosion of materials, should be taken into consideration.   perimeter of thin samples and, in some cases, cause the samples to roll up or be released before  full sample erosion.  . Samples to be evaluated for atomic oxygen interaction or durability evaluation should  be marked so that their orientation is known. This allows for potential determination of causes of  anomalous behavior with respect to the ram direction or possible contamination.  . To properly evaluate radiation-induced tensile property damage in thin-film  polymers, it is important to store samples in vacuum and at low (room) temperatures and to test  them as soon as possible after retrieval.     high-fluence missions. This should be taken into account when projecting the durability of a  polymer being exposed to atomic oxygen.  Protection of Materials from Atomic Oxygen Attack in Low Earth Orbit.
