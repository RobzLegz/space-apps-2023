Examples of such joints include between shield and backshell, backshell and connector, harness  connector and enclosure connector, and enclosure connector and equipment enclosure.   EBR 28] Antennas that require low impedance to the ground plane for proper operation shall  meet Class R requirements.   rotection against lightning strikes should be provided for launch vehicles and their payloads  during transportation, storage, prelaunch, launch, and landing. Propellant, pyrotechnics, and  electronic equipment are particularly susceptible to direct and indirect effects of lightning. Refer  to Appendix B.3.5 for more information.  a. [EBR 29] To distribute the current around the vehicle and minimize the currents near  possible entry points into the vehicle and near critical areas and systems (including pyrotechnic  systems, rocket motors, fuel handling and storage areas, antennas, electronic equipment, and  signal and power cables), multiple low impedance paths shall be incorporated across and through  vehicle outer mold line and structural components.  b. [EBR 31] Each electrical bond shall be bonded using the methods described in  section 5.1, have low resistance and adequate contact area to carry its share of lightning current  without sustaining a burning, melting, distorting, or other heating effect due to the long duration,  high-current portion of the lightning strike.

A mechanically secure electrical bond path is a continuous bond path that maintains the default  dc resistance (or lower) after exposure to shock, vibration, launch loads, and other expected  mechanical movement.  A limit of 1.0 ohm is used as a requirement because it is easily obtained with good contact  between conductive surfaces. Static charges can usually be dissipated through less conductive  connections.  igher dc resistance values acceptable for Class S electrical bonds may be determined  through performance of a detailed analysis to determine the amount of stored energy on  the item to be bonded as a function of the proposed electrical bond resistance.   electrical bonds, the stored energy determined by the analysis shall be less than applicable hazard  threshold levels for personnel shock, equipment upset, flammable materials, gases, or vapors, or  electro-explosive device (EED) ignition for approval of the proposed electrical bond resistance.

[EBR 57] Specific Class S electrical bond values in hazardous areas shall be  determined through performance of a detailed analysis to determine the amount of stored energy  on the item to be bonded as a function of the proposed electrical bond resistance.  (1) [EBR 58] The stored energy determined by the analysis shall be 1/10 of  applicable minimum ignition energy (MIE) (or 20 decibels (dB) below)  threshold level for the flammable materials, gases, or vapors that may be  present.                     voltage, generated by fluid flow, will not exceed 350 volts at any point outside the pipes, tubes,  or hoses.         he following paragraphs describe the bonding methods, with the metal-to-metal method being  the preferred method. The metal-to-metal method may not be feasible, and the bonding strap or  fastener method may be the best bonding alternative for the application.    the mated surfaces into one piece of metal, such as by welding or brazing, are considered  permanent and inherently bonded.   have their faying surfaces prepared prior to assembly in accordance with paragraph 5.2 to ensure  a good electrical bond.   accordance with applicable mechanical engineering assembly and installation  requirements.                               (1) [EBR 65] The bond straps shall be capable of withstanding the anticipated motion  and vibration requirements without suffering metal fatigue or other failure.  Extra care should be utilized in the attachment of the ends of bonding straps to prevent arcing or  other means of electrical noise generation with movements of the strap.            (2) [EBR 71] The cross-sectional area of any individual jumper shall not be less than  number 12 American Wire Gauge (AWG) wire (6530 circular mils) for stranded  copper, and not less than number 10 AWG wire (10,380 circular mils) for  stranded aluminum.    (3) [EBR 72] Where the jumper is subject to arcing, a minimum of number 7 AWG  (20,820 circular mils) for copper or number 5 AWG (33,100 circular mils) for  aluminum for each jumper shall apply.                                 f the bond application is approved by the procuring agency, fasteners (e.g., bolts, nuts, or studs)  may be used to meet bonding requirements. Fasteners should be primarily used to maintain  pressure on faying surfaces. However, in some cases fasteners may perform better than straps  for Class L and R applications. The inductance of multiple bolts between otherwise isolated  materials may be less than the inductance of a strap between surfaces.   performed showing that the number of bolts used in the path is sufficient to provide a low  impedance path.        . [EBR 78] For Class L applications, multiple rivets, bolts, or other fasteners shall be  used at joints in vehicle skin and structure to ensure multiple metallic contact areas capable of  sharing lightning current.

(4) Cadmium-plated hardware.                blowing, vacuuming, or wiping with appropriate solvent as necessary to remove dust or other  foreign particles before mating.  Non-hardening sealant or thermal grease may be applied to the faying surfaces of semi-  permanent joints if tests indicate bonding requirements can be met after assembly.   If the bond is permanent, a hardening sealant, such as chromated epoxy primer, may be used if  tests indicate bonding requirements can be met after assembly.     impairs the effectiveness of any electrical bond and weakens the structure in which it occurs.  When choosing materials for a given electrical bonding application, major factors that  contribute to corrosion are the degree of separation of metals in the galvanic series and the  amount of moisture present.       mating surfaces to expose the graphite layer. Electrical bonds between CFRP sheets can be  made by overlapping exposed graphite on both sheets. Conductive epoxy may also be placed on  the exposed graphite, and bonding connections may be made to metallic surfaces through the  conductive epoxy.   arbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) provides some conductivity through the graphite  filaments. However, the graphite is usually covered with nonconductive epoxy or phenolic  material.                           ome requirements should be verified at the equipment level, such as bonding of equipment  assembly interfaces and connector backshell contacts.   measurement may be an option. Controls need to be implemented in shield termination paths  through connector assemblies. A realistic value would be on the order of 10 milliohms from the  shield to the electronics enclosure for a cadmium-plated aluminum assembly, with 2.5 milliohms  maximum for any particular joint.            .

An example of electrical bonding for more than one purpose would be  a piece of electronic equipment powered from the system power supply. It would require Class R  bonding for RF and Class H bonding for fault current protection. Since both classes are  applicable, the bond should be low inductance with no more than 2.5 milliohms dc resistance for  Class R, and the contact area should be adequate to carry the maximum fault current that could  occur for Class H.  A nose cone should meet the lightning and static charge requirements. The Class L requirement  calls for low inductance, low resistance, and adequate area to carry lightning current. Since the  bond requirement for static charge is only moderately low resistance, the lightning bond will be  sufficient for both.  he only requirement for conductive tubing carrying fluid will be to meet the Class S  requirement. An electrical bond to basic structure of 1.0 ohm or less will be adequate.    ee paragraph 4.1.2 for applicable requirements. A dedicated power return is preferred over the  use of structure for power current return and will be stated as a requirement for most programs.  However, structure return is occasionally used for some systems such as small satellites.  n those cases where structure current is used, the voltage drop allowed divided by the maximum  current that may be delivered by the power supply will give the total resistance allowed in the  circuit. This total resistance includes the wire, its connectors, and all Class C electrical bond  joints in the structure return path. The resistance limit for each Class C electrical bond joint can  then be determined by subtracting the resistance of the wire and interconnections from the total  resistance, and dividing the remaining value by the number of Class C electrical bond joints in  the path.  between a power wire and a metallic equipment case or other conductive structure, should return  through structure and the joints in the structure to its source. Circuit protection devices are  intended to limit the duration of fault current events to prevent a significant temperature increase  in the circuit wiring. Typically, the fault current is considerably higher than the fuse or breaker  value, and it trips the device quickly. However, a circuit breaker can sometimes take several  seconds to trip with a current twice its rating. Resistance across all the joints in the return path  should be low enough to allow enough current to trip circuit protection devices in a timely  manner.                SAE-ARP-1870, Aerospace Systems Electrical Bonding and Grounding for Electromagnetic  Compatibility and Safety, restricts voltages on electronic equipment cases to less than 4.5 volts  and requires no fire or damage to the bond in the event of a short to case.  or shock protection from voltages exceeding 30 volts, MIL-HDBK-274, Military Handbook:  Electrical Grounding for Aircraft Safety, recommends a circuit breaker break time of 0.2 second.  tructural material that is not highly conductive, such as glass or graphite fiber reinforced plastic  (GFRP), may increase the path resistance enough to delay or prevent tripping the circuit breaker.  In addition to being a shock hazard, fault current can cause ignition of graphite epoxy material.   inductance of the strap is not a concern for fault current since the high current will be from a dc  or low frequency alternating current (ac) power source. Inductance will be a concern if the strap  conducts RF or lightning current.     equipment, but it is difficult to determine in advance which equipment really needs to be well  bonded. The low impedance to structure is necessary for certain power line to equipment chassis  filters and for proper operation of cable shields terminated to equipment chassis. Isolated  structural elements with linear dimensions approaching 1/4 wavelength, can pick up and re-  radiate RF from high power transmitters or develop enough voltage to produce a glow discharge  or arcing to other elements. This should be taken into account when sizing the length of straps or  jumpers used for Class R bonds, as such elements themselves can become a significant source of  interference under conditions described above.   metal-to-metal contact that can be expected to be consistent. The basic requirement is to have  low impedance at the frequency or frequencies of interest. The value of this impedance depends  upon the quality of the surface preparation (e.g., the chemical formulation used for the  conversion coating, and the thickness thereof), the area of the faying surfaces in contact, and the  amount of pressure holding the surfaces together. The impedance of an acceptable bond may be  in the ohms range for RF even though the dc resistance is less than 2.5 milliohms. The resistance  is overshadowed by the inductive reactance of the configuration.   reactance greater than 2.5 milliohms at frequencies above 10 megahertz (MHz). RF bonds may be  satisfactory with several ohms of impedance; but, when straps are used, even these levels will be  quickly exceeded as frequency increases. If the use of bond straps for RF bonds is unavoidable,  strap length should always be limited to a length to width ratio of 5 to 1.  onopole or half-loop antennas mounted on composite outer mold line surfaces should be  provided with circular or elliptical groundplanes or counterpoises 1/4 wavelength in radii over  the operating frequency range of the antenna, and should be installed with a low impedance         return path to vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance no greater than 2.5 milliohms, so that  antenna fields are not attenuated by poorly conductive composite material. Antennas mounted on  composite outer mold line surfaces that do not require local groundplanes or counterpoises but  that otherwise require a low impedance path to the vehicle structure for proper operation, should  be installed with a low impedance return path to the vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance  no greater than 2.5 milliohms. Antennas of all types, mounted on metallic outer mold line  surfaces, that require a low impedance path to the mounting surface for proper operation, should  provide a return path to vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance no greater than 2.5  milliohms.  he 2.5-milliohm dc resistance requirement is good for a standard, but one should not assume a  good RF bond exists just because the dc resistance is less than 2.5 milliohms. Also, extra effort  need not be made just to satisfy the dc requirement if the RF impedance is much higher due to  the inductance of the configuration. Look at the whole configuration to get the lowest impedance  possible at the frequencies of interest to produce a good RF bond.  he electrical bond path between an electronic box and the structure has a complex equivalent  circuit that may be simplified to a resistance in series with an inductance all in parallel with a  capacitance. The equivalent resistance includes the resistance of any bond strap present plus the  resistance of the joints in the path. At higher frequencies, where the diameter or thickness of the  strap significantly exceeds the skin depth, the ac resistance becomes larger than the dc resistance.  The ac resistance increases with the square root of frequency.  he inductance is directly proportional to the length of the bond path, but is also a function of  width and thickness. Multiple paths can reduce the inductance value by introducing additional  parallel current paths. The magnitude of inductive reactance increases 20 dB with every decade  of frequency increase.   he total impedance across the joint is equal to the resistance at frequencies from dc to the point  where the inductive reactance approaches the resistance. The impedance due to inductance then  increases at 20 dB per decade of frequency to a frequency where the inductive reactance and the  capacitive reactance are equal. At this parallel resonant frequency, the impedance may rise to  thousands of ohms depending on the ratio of reactance to resistance (Q) in the circuit. The Q is  high when the resistance is low, which is usually the case for a bonding joint. At frequencies  above this point, the capacitive reactance is less than the inductive reactance; and the total  impedance begins to come back down. Often there are more complex series and parallel  resonances; and, at the higher frequencies, the impedance may vary considerably.  inversely proportional to the distance between the box and the structure. The magnitude of  capacitive reactance decreases 20 dB per decade of frequency increase.             For electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing, the equipment under test (EUT) bonding method  to the copper-top test table will be as close as practicable to the flight configuration (i.e., bond  strap, surface mating, etc.). Only the provisions included in the design of the equipment and  specified in the installation instructions will be used to bond units, such as equipment case and  mount, together or to the ground plane. If the EUT is secured to mounting bases, incorporating  shock or vibration isolators, such mounting bases will be used in the test configuration. Bonding  straps furnished with the mounting base will be connected to the ground plane. Where mounting  bases do not incorporate bonding straps, bonding straps will not be used in the test setup. If  installation conditions for the EUT are unknown, the EUT will not be grounded. Portable  equipment should be tested while bonded to the ground plane and also while not bonded to the  ground plane.   ee paragraph 4.1.5 for applicable requirements. Electrical bonding in itself does not ensure  lightning protection, but it is a major part of the overall plan. Lightning current usually enters  one extremity of the vehicle and exits at another extremity. Lightning current is high and  voltages developed across joints are high enough to arc and provide a path to some exit point. A  good current path should be provided around the outside of the vehicle to help protect internal  equipment. Electrical bonding helps provide the proper continuity for the path.  Even when a large current path is provided to carry the current, attach points across joints still  may present a problem. Arcing at joints can be expected even with good electrical bonds.  Lightning current waveforms, as defined in SAE-ARP-5412, have rates of rise of 1 x 1011  amps/second. Considering a bond connection with inductance of 0.1 \uf06dH would result in a  voltage spike across the joint of 10,000 volts. The arc produces an ionized path that helps carry  the current. The majority of the current can be kept external to the vehicle through good  electrical bonding of the vehicle skin.   resistance are kept as low as possible. The strap and connections should be robust enough to  survive the high lightning current and the magnetic forces resulting from high lightning current.  Straps should not have loops or bends greater than 45 degrees to avoid damage from magnetic  forces. Information concerning lightning bonds may be found in \u201cLightning Protection of  Aircraft\u201d by Lightning Technologies, Inc.  pertures should be kept as small as possible. Joints should be bonded in many places to prevent  long slots between bonds. Joints and apertures in the skin allow some voltage to be induced into  underlying cables. This voltage should be kept low enough to prevent disrupting electronic  equipment.  pecial care should be taken to route current around fuel or pyrotechnics to prevent arcs that  can ignite fuel or current that can fire pyrotechnics. Fuel and pyrotechnics should be completely  enclosed by a Faraday cage of conductive material bonded to structure to provide an adequate  margin against ignition. Wires to pyrotechnics should be shielded and the shields should have  360 degrees terminations to the metal enclosure.          lower charged object affects the rate of discharge for an item being charged. A low resistance  reduces the charge faster, but bonds with resistances that would be considered high, such as 10  kilohms to 100 kilohms, usually function adequately. The charging current, usually in  microamps, returning through the resistance to ground determines the voltage developed.  lectrostatic charges should be controlled and dissipated to avoid fuel ignition and ordnance  hazards, to protect personnel from shock hazards, and to prevent performance degradation or  damage to electronics. A requirement for 1.0 ohm or less to ground is a good requirement for  metal items because any good metal-to-metal connection will measure less than 1.0 ohm. Under  some circumstances, such as when semiconductive materials or complex configurations are used,  this limit may be increased. Metal straps or jumpers across joints are adequate since the current  is dc.  n arc discharge can cause direct effects to the item being discharged and to the item receiving  the discharge. Indirect effects may be caused by voltages induced into neighboring items. Direct  or indirect effects include physical damage to an item, upset of operation, ignition, or shock to  personnel.  ngineering guidelines and design practices to minimize the effects of spacecraft surface and  internal charging in space environments is given in NASA-HDBK-4002A, Mitigating In-Space  Charging Effects \u2013 A Guideline. It serves as a reference source that contains suggested detailed  spacecraft design requirements and procedures to minimize the effects of spacecraft charging and  to limit the effects of the resulting ESD. This Handbook is complementary to NASA-STD-4005,  Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Charging Design Standard, and NASA-HDBK-4006, Low Earth  Orbit Spacecraft Charging Design Handbook. NASA-STD-4005 and NASA-HDBK-4006  address Low Earth Orbit spacecraft charging at the auroral zones (attitude from 200 and 1000 km  and latitude between -50 and +50 degrees).  aunch service providers, such as the Eastern Test Range (ETR), may impose additional  requirements on the flight vehicles that launch from their range. The ETR levies a surface  conductivity requirement on flight vehicles to protect from triboelectrification effects. Air Force  specification, AFSPCMAN91-710V6, Range Safety User Requirements Manual Volume 6 \u2013  Ground and Launch Personnel, Equipment, Systems, and Material Operations Safety  Requirements, contains the following triboelectrification requirements:    \u201cA7.2.5.4.10. Triboelectrification. Do not launch if a vehicle has not been treated for  surface electrification and the flight path will go through any clouds above the \u201310 \u00b0C  level up to the altitude at which the vehicle\u2019s velocity exceeds 3,000 ft/sec. A vehicle is  considered \u201ctreated\u201d for surface electrification if:               \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.1. All surfaces of the vehicle susceptible to precipitation particle  impact have been treated to assure    \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.1.2. That all conductors on surface (including dielectric  surfaces that have been treated with conductive coatings) are bonded to  the vehicle by a resistance that is less than 105ohms;   \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.2. It has been shown by test or analysis that electrostatic discharges  (ESDs) on the surface of the vehicle caused by triboelectrification by ice particle  impact will not be hazardous to the launch vehicle or the mission. In  A7.2.5.4.10.1.1 above, the correct unit for surface resistivity is ohms/square. This  means that any square area of any size measured in any units has the same  resistance in ohms when the measurement is made from an electrode extending  the length of one side of the square to an electrode extending the length of the  opposite side of the square. The area-independence is literally valid only for  squares; it is not true for other shapes such as rectangles and circles.\u201d  In summary, bonding for electrostatic charge should use the 1.0-ohm requirement for ordinary  metal joints to ensure a good connection. The 1.0-ohm requirement simply ensures the metal-to-  metal bond is a clean, quality bond that will retain its conductivity. Good connections that  measure up to 100 kilohms from equipment to ground for unusual configurations or  semiconductive materials may be acceptable. Jumpers and straps may be used.     Two materials may be placed in direct contact if the electromotive force (EMF) difference  between their groups is not more than 0.25 volts. Where other dissimilar materials are placed in  contact, galvanic reaction may cause corrosion of the material that is higher (more anodic) in the  galvanic series. Corrosion impedes current flow and damages materials. When two materials  form a couple that is incompatible, the materials should be plated, coated, or otherwise protected  with a conductive finish compatible with each; or a material compatible with each should be  inserted between the two materials.  If the mating of dissimilar materials cannot be avoided, the most active of the materials should  be replaceable in reusable vehicles. In all applications the electrolyte contact area of the most  anodic materials, higher in series, should be larger than that of the cathodic materials. The larger                           the anodic area the lower the current density will be on more cathodic-materials. An approved  sealant should be used to seal all edges from moisture.    tubing provides a charging source. If the fluid is not conductive, it can carry charges to  conductive items in the fluid path. Conductive items in the fluid flow path should be bonded to  structure to prevent a static charge buildup.   Conductive hose or tubing grounded to structure will help prevent charging. Conductive fluids  can also prevent the charge separation. With a nonconductive fluid in nonconductive tubing, the  charge may transfer to conductive items in the line or, if enough potential develops, a discharge  may occur through an arc from the fluid through the tubing to a metal sheath or other conductive  items outside the tubing. This arc may produce small holes in the tubing.  Tubing is available that is somewhat conductive and prevents the separation and movement of  the charge if its resistivity is less than 1 megohm per meter of length. Fluids with volume  resistivity less than 107 ohm-meters are conductive enough to prevent the separation of charge,  but there is seldom a choice of fluids.    could be a problem. CFRP, or composite materials that contain metal particles, could be  conductive enough to drain off static charges if given a conductive path from the material to  metallic structure. See paragraph 5.4 for applicable CFRP requirements when using materials,  such as honeycomb graphite panels.   ince these composite materials are relatively poor conductors, they should not be used to carry  high current. The resistance would cause excessive voltage drop for intentional power return, and  short circuit current may be limited to levels too low to trigger circuit protection devices.  CFRP may be used as RF ground even though its dc resistance may exceed the usual Class R  limits. If the resistance through the composite structure can be kept to a few ohms, the total  impedance to RF will depend upon the inductance of the configuration just as it would with metal.  Special attention should be given to bonding across joints in composite materials. The graphite  layers are conductive, but epoxy, phenolic, isocyanate, polyimide, or other polymeric resin may  cover the surface of the composite. This nonconductive outer layer should be removed to expose  the graphite so conductive connections may be made at joints. If the bond is for RF purposes, do  not depend on narrow straps. The connection should be continuous along edges that have been  abraded to expose graphite. Connection may be made by overlapping panels or by adding a  conductive bridge secured by metal fasteners or by conductive adhesive across the joint.                   he conductive layers of multilayer insulation may be bonded together at several points using  accordion-shaped metal foil fitted into the edges of the conductive layers so that each conductive  layer contacts the foil. A rivet or bolt through the layers and the foil will assure contact and will  provide a point for attachment to structure. Good conductivity should be verified by test.   required nor desirable unless specifically noted by the procuring agency. Usually tests of certain  processes can verify that the process will result in a satisfactory bond. Other bonds using the  same process can be verified by similarity. Verification that the same process was used on each  bond should be adequate. Testing to verify resistance limits may be required depending upon the  criticality of the equipment and the purpose of the bond as determined by the specific project.  For example, all antenna installations and all electronic equipment may be required to be tested  for resistance to structure, but the low impedance and current carrying requirements will still be  verified by inspection and analysis.     resistance requirements. These processes should also be called out on fabrication drawings and  verified by quality.   bond required. For Class C, H, and L, the bond should have enough contact area to carry the  intentional, fault, or lightning current. Class L bonds should also be robust enough to withstand  the magnetic effects of the large current being carried, if they are to be useful for more than one  strike. These requirements are typically verified by analysis and inspection of the drawings and  the installation.   made to determine the impedance of any RF bond other than direct metal-to-metal contact over a  large surface area.  he effectiveness of a direct bond is dependent upon the clamping pressure. A maintenance  program should be put in place to verify these bonds still meet the requirements throughout the  life cycle of the system.  n short, bonding should be verified by analysis, some tests of actual bonds, and tests of samples  of a process, inspection of physical bonds and processes, and similarity to other good bonds. An  electrical bonding path diagram may aid in verification of the complete bonding path. An  example of a bonding path diagram is shown in figure 2, Electrical Bonding Path Diagram  Example. It is not required to use the same symbols or even the same structure.                             "}
