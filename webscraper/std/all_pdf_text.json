Of particular interest are spacecraft  system designs that are needed to meet stringent fault-free operation for a period of days to years  in space without maintenance. The first objective is to develop an understanding of electrical  insulation characteristics and the influence of aging. A second objective is to capture decades of  lessons learned and present recommended design, analysis, and test methodologies that have  been applied to the many successful space vehicle electronic programs during their development,  manufacture, final assembly, test, and flight.   his NASA Technical Handbook is applicable to all high-voltage power systems that operate in  space.

The resistivity is therefore the quotient of the potential gradient, in V/m,  and the current per unit of electrode length, A/m. Since the four ends of the electrodes define a  square, the lengths in the quotient cancel and surface resistivities are most accurately reported in  ohms, although it is common to see the more descriptive unit of ohms per square.

The trend is toward more advanced systems operating at higher  voltages in compact, economical packages that have been submitted to a battery of controls to  ensure a high-quality assembly. If materials are to be operated under much more demanding  specifications, better information is required on the limits of these materials and on their design  and manufacturing techniques.  lthough section 3.2 gives definitions of many terms used in this NASA Technical Handbook,  for better clarification, it is important to provide additional explanation for the following major  terms:    above which electrical breakdown phenomena are likely to occur. The absolute voltage for a  breakdown event, however, is dependent upon the electrical parameters (frequency and  magnitude) and structural, geometric, and environmental constraints. Breakdown voltages can  range from tens of volts in microwave systems to thousands of volts in utility systems.  . \u201cElectrical insulation\u201d is a generic term given to vacuum, or to gaseous, liquid, and  solid materials exhibiting high electric resistivity that may be used to electrically isolate two or  more conducting surfaces.                    as internal discharges in the cavities within the solid dielectric, surface discharges along the  surface of insulator, and corona discharges around a sharp edge (usually around the electrode  surface). Usually, the magnitude of such discharges is small; however, they may cause  progressive deterioration of the insulation and lead to ultimate failure.  . \u201cPure air\u201d: The composition of air is variable with respect to several of its  components (e.g. CH4, CO2, H2O) so 'pure' air has no precise meaning. The composition of the  major components in dry air is relatively constant (percent by volume given): nitrogen, 78.084;  oxygen, 20.946; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide, 0.033; neon, 0.0018; helium, 0.000524; methane,  0.00016; krypton, 0.000114; hydrogen 0.00005; nitrous oxide, 0.00003; xenon, 0.0000087. The  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons and some  other species of anthropogenic origin are increasing measurably with time. For purposes of this  document, \u201cpure air\u201d is assumed to consist of such a mixture that is free of any contaminant that  could possibly alter its electrical or dielectric behavior.  For early spacecraft missions, techniques were developed for the detection of partial discharges  in spacecraft electronic equipment. Use of these techniques clearly showed that the reduction of  partial discharges enhanced equipment life, and thereafter testing incorporating such techniques  made mandatory to eliminate faulty insulation and flawed workmanship. Some examples of  representative instrumentation and test techniques, both of which have matured and improved  over time, are described later in this NASA Technical Handbook.  n the modern spacecraft electronics industry, dense packaging is required to make the  equipment fit within a restricted volume. Likewise, weight is restricted to economize on fuel and  maximize space for the payload. Consequently, high electrical field stresses, which enhance  partial discharge activity, are often present. Such partial discharge activities can be a contributing  factor in insulation degradation.  insulation degradation, electromagnetic interference (EMI), and the upset of poorly protected  sensitive circuits without proper shielding or noise suppression. Insulated conductors may be  highly susceptible to continuous corona or partial discharges when operated at very low pressure  gaseous environments, because the corona, or breakdown initiation voltage, is a function of both  the density and content of the gaseous environment. For example, helium has a much lower  breakdown voltage at low pressures than air or nitrogen. The insulated and non-insulated  conductors, terminations, and other electrical/electronic parts may be susceptible to this  phenomenon in the high field stresses caused by the dense population of parts within the system  design. Some insulation systems, however, can endure partial discharge or corona activities for  microseconds to milliseconds, for thousands of repetitive occurrences, as experienced with pulse  power applications.            lectrical and electronic equipment used in space applications should be designed to operate  over a range of pressures and temperatures from sea level conditions to the space environment.  Most terrestrial low-voltage equipment can be designed to meet the sea-level requirement by  using conformal coatings on all parts and boards and by using properly spaced parts and circuits.  However, at low-pressure or vacuum conditions, these techniques may not be applicable. Hence,  spacecraft equipment designs should consider rarefied gas or air as an essential packaging design  criterion. Lightweight, small volume packaging dictates that circuitry operating in rarefied air  may require special consideration, such as pressurization or encapsulation. Gas-filled packages  require conformal coatings to prevent corrosion, voltage breakdown, and flashover between  closely spaced electrodes when operated at higher voltages. Furthermore, many equipment  failures are caused by corroding circuitry related to exposure to wide temperature ranges, humid  environments (manned spacecraft), contamination (collection and deposition of debris, oils, and  dirt), or a very dry, hot environment (unmanned spacecraft) while operating. Additionally,  delamination of insulating materials has also caused problems. When designing high-voltage  systems for space applications, these issues also should be addressed.  continuing process for applications in manned and unmanned spacecraft. The initial studies and  test evaluations began following World War II and continue for modern aerospace equipment.  All of the testing techniques and procedures for the data presented herein were initiated in the  early 1950s and should continue well into the 21st century.    ome of the better insulation compositions containing asbestos were deleted from use in space  programs in the 1960s but may be reinstated for very special applications in the future. Although  mica is a material with excellent electrical, temperature, and chemical characteristics, it is  difficult to apply to long, thin conductors at present; therefore, most electrical insulating  materials consist of organic, inorganic, and glass fiber composite insulation systems. Among  these, most organic composite materials have an upper long-life temperature limit of less than  260 \u00b0C. While this temperature range is adequate for some space applications (e.g. avionics), for  many others their use may be limited. The electrical and electronics industries have been making  concerted efforts to reduce the weight and size of parts in their various systems, as time and  technology progress. Along with this, the insulation on flat and round conductors has been  reduced to a minimum that can provide the necessary mechanical, chemical, thermal, and  electrical characteristics.   a high-voltage system in space would be a challenging task and systems insulation should have  life similar to the spacecraft itself. The true rating for an insulation system is the voltage at which  the insulation life becomes infinite on a voltage-time curve as determined experimentally. If an  excessively high voltage is applied to the insulation system repeatedly, the life will be shortened.  There is a much lower voltage at which the life becomes infinite. This is the voltage at which the  curve becomes asymptotic to the lifetime axis. In some insulation systems, it is often noted that             the rated voltage, as determined by the lifetime curve, is also the corona inception (or initiation)  voltage (CIV). System operation above the CIV seriously degrades the insulation life. This  implies that to ensure maximum life, there must be no corona or partial discharges in the system.   important secondary factors related to corona and transients include radiated and conducted EMI,  production of ozone and other noxious gases, and power loss associated with the partial  discharge energy. This implies that a calculation of the corona inception voltage for a given  insulation system is a logical approach in determining a maximum voltage rating for a given  system.  bridging the electrodes is termed partial discharge. Potential sites of such discharges are voids or  gaseous inclusions in the bulk of solid insulation or in bubbles in liquid dielectric material (e.g.  transformer oil), which could be distributed randomly either because of natural defects or by way  of manufacturing. A partial discharge is the breakdown of such a void between two surfaces with  a voltage difference between them.    hen an electric field is applied in a gas-filled region, no current flows, apart from capacitive  current, unless there are free electric charges present. When the applied electric field strength is  low, the current flow is usually related to external sources and is not sufficient to cause any  partial discharges. However, at higher applied electric field strengths, the free charged particles  can gain energies from the field, resulting in ionization of the gaseous species by elastic or  inelastic collisions. In gaseous environments and uniform fields, buildup of charge leads to an  unstable situation, in which the current increases very rapidly while the applied voltage  collapses. This usually results in a discharge bridging the electrode gap. However, in a highly  non-uniform field, the charges can form a kind of electrostatic shield around the electrode where  the electric field strength is greater and, therefore, causes quenching of the self-sustained  discharge. The resulting discharge does not bridge the gap and usually is called the corona  discharge. Further, this discharge may be either pulsating or continuous, and the average current  may be relatively low (in the milliampere range).  n practice, the term \u201ccorona\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term \u201cpartial discharge.\u201d  However, corona is local ionization of a gaseous medium caused by a high electric field stress  around a point or wire, whereas partial discharge occurs in a void or bubble in the dielectric  material or insulation.                      of the dielectric material but on the stress in the cavity (shape dependent) and the breakdown  strength of the cavity (type of the gas species; density dependent). Since cavity shape and  characteristics of the gas inside it cannot be predicted precisely, the partial discharge initiation  voltage predictions are relatively more difficult than corona initiation predictions.  vessels, effectively isolating the system from the external environment. In this case, the  environment is part of the system design and accounts for high voltages present. Pressurization is  often considered impractical because it requires heavy, tight enclosures with special high-quality  seals. Nevertheless, when this approach is taken, one can assume that significant high-voltage  interactions will not occur; therefore, this case is not considered further in this NASA Technical  Handbook.   n general, a spacecraft\u2019s interaction with its environment is of paramount concern for spacecraft  design and operation. High-voltage systems require special precautions because of the  ever-present possibility of gas discharge phenomena. The following are outlined in this section:      he dominant environment between 100 and 1000 km altitude is the neutral atmosphere. In this  essentially collisionless regime, the gases are in hydrostatic equilibrium. Below about 100 km,  where the atmosphere is homogeneous, the composition is approximately 80 percent nitrogen  (N2) and 18 percent oxygen (O2) with traces of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), argon (Ar), and other  gases. Above 100 km, atomic oxygen, which is made from the photo dissociation of molecular                            oxygen (O2), comes to dominate. Above about 800 km, the atmosphere is largely atomic  hydrogen (H). At a 500-km altitude, the number density of neutral species varies from 2\uf0b4106 to  3\uf0b4108 cm-3, depending on the level of solar activity and position in the orbit. The kinetic  temperature of the gas is usually between 500 and 2000 K, and the ambient pressure is in the  range of 10-10 to 5\uf0b410-8 Torr.   in situ neutral composition and satellite drag measurements have evolved over the years into  reliable predictors of the average composition and thermal structure of the thermosphere. The  most notable of these models are the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (MSIS) model  (Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)) based on in situ satellite observations of neutral  concentrations, the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) version of the Jacchia model derived  from satellite drag measurements, and the United States (U.S.) Standard Atmosphere (National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)). These models provide good estimates of the  thermosphere environment as functions of altitude, longitude, latitude, local time, magnetic  activity, and solar activity and are continually updated as new information becomes available. Of  particular interest is AIAA standard Guide to Reference and Standard Atmosphere Models,  which provides guidelines for selected reference and standard atmospheric models including  consideration of their content, uncertainties, and limitations.   spacecraft never operates in a clean environment. The environment in which a spacecraft  operates is a combination of the ambient and various gaseous components originating from  outgassing and other contamination sources from the vehicle itself. Outgassing from the  spacecraft structure and its subsystems begins to rapidly increase from the moment of launch,  while the ambient pressure quickly decreases from sea-level atmospheric pressure (760 Torr) to  that of orbit ambient pressure (less than 10-6 Torr). This external pressure change takes only a  few minutes, whereas the pressure next to the spacecraft surface and the spacecraft interior  pressure will remain at a higher pressure throughout the life of the spacecraft, because of the  outgassing of electrical, structural, and purging systems aboard the spacecraft.     of dry air at a pressure of 10-6 Torr is greater than 5\uf0b4105 V/cm, a value 16 times the dielectric  strength of air at sea level. This is because there are few charge carriers, and the mean free path  of electrons exceeds the gap length between closely spaced electrodes. For internal volumes of a  spacecraft and even for external adjacent spaces, such vacuum conditions are seldom achieved.  The designer should assume, therefore, that the environment is characterized by a low-pressure  gaseous environment.  n a typical case, a system can be described as a vented enclosure within which sources of gas  production will reach equilibrium with venting. Sources include the following:                  t has been observed in the past that these sources are capable of maintaining a spacecraft  pressure of about 0.01 Torr for several minutes to hours even though the external pressure is less  than 10-6 Torr. Figure 1, Spacecraft Internal Pressure, shows data for a particular spacecraft  (Sutton and Stern, 1975).   uring the boost phase, most of the gas escapes rapidly from the spacecraft interior for the first  30 km into space, while continuum flow exists. During this interval, the interior pressure of the  spacecraft is nearly the same as the external pressure. As the spacecraft continues on its projected  course, its internal pressure will be greater than the external pressure. This is because of slow  outgassing and venting through small orifices, tubes, and cracks for gases entrapped in electrical  and thermal insulation and structural materials.   here are several ways to calculate the internal gas pressure and flow rates through the openings,  cracks, or orifices for a spacecraft. Depending on the gas density, these calculations can be in the  and voltage breakdown at low gas pressures. Enclosed electronic equipment with restricted  venting, which delays outgassing, may be a cause of faults within high-voltage equipment.            molecular flow region, viscous flow region, or transition region (Dushman and Lafferty, 1965).  For a spacecraft with small amounts of outgassing products and operating in a low-pressure  environment, the flow can be characterized as molecular flow because the mean free path of the  molecules is much larger than the dimensions of the orifice or the openings. Then, the gas flow  can be calculated by the Clausing equation (Dushman and Lafferty, 1965).   1/2  )    C is the flow conductance of the orifices in cm3/s  A is the total area of the orifices in cm2  T is the internal temperature in K  M is the molecular weight of the gas in g/mole  K is a dimensionless function of orifice (tube) length over diameter and is tabulated in (Dushman  and Lafferty, 1965).    nd accounts for the Botzmann constant, the conversion from mass to molecular weight, and  absorbs several dimensionless integers. This equation can be used for estimating the flow of gas  from chamber to chamber in a multiple chamber vacuum system.  rates. He showed that the depressurization time constant \uf074 is V/C, where \uf074 is the time for the  pressure to decrease to 36 percent of its initial pressure, V is the volume in cubic centimeters, and  C is the flow conductance for the orifices in cubic centimeters per second, given by        1/2  )       Ak is the area of the k orifices in square centimeters  m = mass of the gas molecule in grams  k is the Boltzmann constant  Air and nitrogen have a time constant of approximately 0.4 s when bled through a 1-cm2 opening  in a steel sphere (Scialdone, 1969). NASA experience (Sutton and Stern, 1975) has shown that a  0.1 time constant ensures adequate outgassing around high-voltage circuits.                   electrically insulated parts, semi-shielded boxes, and boxes within modules. In addition,  compressed gases for orbit adjustment are carried and released. With these complexities, it is  more appropriate to qualify the design by testing the completely assembled spacecraft. This can  be done in a thermal vacuum chamber to measure the real internal and external spacecraft  pressures and the outgassing rate, instead of relying on calculated outgassing values for the  system integrity.    should be taken, because the outgassing rates for multilayer insulation are different from the  outgassing (or venting) through orifices. This can be seen in an experiment performed using 100  layers of super insulation across the center of a vacuum chamber. The chamber was pumped only  from the side labeled Volume A in figure 2, Effects of Thermal Insulation on Outgassing Rate  (Dunbar, 1988), while Volume B was isolated by the layered insulation. During the initial  pumpdown, gas exhibited bulk flow through interstitial spaces in the insulation. As a result,  during the first 15 min of pumpdown, the pressure in the chamber dropped from sea-level  pressure to 0.1 Torr, with the gauge on the thermally insulated side of the chamber following  pump pressure within 5 percent. As the pump pressure dropped further, entering the high vacuum  regime, the pressure on the insulated side of the chamber decreased very slowly as gas was  released into the chamber by purging and outgassing from the many layers of insulation. This  experiment shows clearly that designers who specify such insulation to control radiative transfer  need to be aware of the lengthy time required to eliminate both trapped and adsorbed gas. Should  high voltage be present in the affected part of the system, such gas might pose a breakdown  threat during the purging process.            n the Apollo telescope mount of the Skylab spacecraft, the area of the outgassing ports was  approximately 1 sq. cm per liter volume, the value recommended for adequate spacecraft  outgassing for high-voltage experiments and equipment onboard Skylab. The resulting pressures  are summarized in figure 3, Gas Pressure Inside the Apollo Telescope Mount (Dunbar, 1973).  The Apollo telescope mount volume included several hundred feet of Teflon\u00ae-insulated  instrumentation and low power wiring, plus the telescopes and ancillary electronic equipment.  Wiring requires significant time for purging since the entrapped gas has to travel up to half the  length of the wire to escape from each end. Clamping can further restrict the gas flow within the  electrical strands.              he Skylab space vehicle had several separate modules, including the airlock module (AM),  multiple-docking adapter (MDA), and the payload shroud/fixed airlock shroud/instrument unit  (PS/FAS/IU). During launch, the vent valves were purposely left open to allow modules to  outgas freely. The module internal pressure was allowed to outgas to a minimum pressure of  25 Torr. At that time, the multiple docking adapter vent was closed; the remaining vent valves  remained open as shown in figure 3. As the Skylab proceeded toward space, at time 600 s after  lift-off, the external (space) pressure was 1.07\uf0b410-8 Torr, but the internal pressures remained  above 10-3 Torr for 20 min. The module internal pressure as a function of time is shown in figure  4, Pressure in Airlock Module Truss Compartment. The sublimator pressure pulses shown in  figure 4 had a flow rate of 0.01156 lbm/s for 300 s per pulse.              oams can be used in electrical and electronic equipment as dielectric material or supporting  (cushioning) material. These foams are very porous, however, and contain large volumes of  captured gas. Since outgassing is very slow and becomes a constant contamination source in  vacuum, use of these foam materials should be avoided in high-voltage systems. The equation to  calculate the diffusion coefficient (D) for a foam can be found in work by Cuddihy and  Moacanin (1965) when needed. They also found that the calculated values for outgassing rates in  polyurethane foam used for electrical/electronic insulation were within a factor of 2 of  experimentally measured values (Cuddihy and Moacanin, 1965). Furthermore, Scannapieco  (1970) gives the outgassing rates of spacecraft materials as a function of temperature and effects  of outgassing on voltage breakdown.  show that the spacecraft internal pressure may be significantly greater than the external pressure  for several days after orbital insertion. Furthermore, outgassing products within a high-voltage  module may keep the pressure near the minimum breakdown potential region for safe, reliable  operation of high-voltage circuits, making it advisable to delay their turn on. Likewise, the  outgassing products of the spacecraft and reaction control propellants increase the pressure in the  vicinity of the spacecraft as shown in figure 1.              uborbital spacecraft have all the short-time outgassing problems of orbital spacecraft, except  that the electronics have to operate from Earth\u2019s surface, to apogee, and back to Earth\u2019s surface.  For example, the X-33 experimental spacecraft was designed for a flight profile commencing at  Earth\u2019s surface, progressing to a maximum apogee of 150,000 ft altitude, and returning to Earth.  Maximum external pressure of the vehicle would be as great as 760 Torr at launch (Earth\u2019s sea-  level average pressure). Minimum external airframe pressure would be that of maximum apogee  or less than 0.01 Torr.    Aboard a Rocket (BEAR) spacecraft is reported by Nunz (1990). An example of outgassing is  shown for the BEAR space orbiter electronics compartment in figure 5, Payload Pressure for a  Vented Payload During Launch. The curve designated as region 2 in figure 5 was for an  electronic component facing space with the side of the spacecraft open to space. In 10 min time,  the pressure remained at 0.05 Torr, that is, BEAR had a large outgassing area compared to the  total surface area. The curve designating the diagnostic region, containing wiring and many  components inside a semi-enclosed compartment, is shown to have had pressure greater than  0.5 Torr for the full 10 min flight time. In addition, there were no purge gases supporting the  pressurization of BEAR. Some suborbital vehicles will have purge gases. Based on the BEAR  pressure profile and continuous outgassing, it is estimated that the pressure around all  components and wiring within the confines of the air frame will have pressure greater than  0.1 Torr for a suborbital flight duration. Figure 5 can be found in Nanevicz and Hilbers (1973).                voltage rocket launch (SPEAR 3). The series tested a variety of very high voltage methods for  using the vacuum as an insulator. See Rustin et al (1993) and Cohen et al. (1995).     and external debris. Helium has also been used as a purge gas; however, compared to other  gases, it has a very low breakdown voltage when depressurized and exacerbates the corona  problem. When helium gas is chosen as the purge gas, a significant amount of residual helium  will be trapped in the porous insulation, such as fiberglass, and inside some electronic  components and parts, such as transformers and power conversion equipment, during the first  flight. Subsequent flights will commence with a higher helium content in the air-helium gas  mixture. This can result in continual corona inside or between components following initiation  for the duration of the flight.  compartments that escape by laminar gas flow, continuous leakage of hydrogen or helium  through tank walls, nitrogen purges of the electronics bay, and the outgassing of parts and  components.   breakdown voltage similar to that of air, which is higher than the helium breakdown voltage. A  small amount of air mixed with nitrogen (less than 5 percent air) gives the mixture  approximately the same breakdown and corona inception characteristic as that of pure air. It is  impossible, therefore, to completely void the airframe with a single nitrogen purge. From a  voltage breakdown or CIV initiation characteristic, a purge with nitrogen is recommended. The  voltage breakdown characteristics of air, helium, hydrogen, and nitrogen are shown in table 1,  Paschen Law Breakdown Voltages at the Critical Pressure-Spacing Dimension for Select Gases  at dc and 400 Hz.

When heated, local  pressure will increase by outgassing of conformal coatings frequently used in such circuits,  potentially resulting in partial discharges. As an example, it was observed in a sensitive  photomultiplier circuit that a mere increase in temperature from 0 to 15 \u00b0C raised the ambient gas  pressure to the extent that the partial discharge counts increased from 10 to 1000 times normal  (Dunbar, 1973). This is shown in figure 6, Partial Discharge Counts Measured in a Sensitive  Photomultiplier Circuit (Dunbar, 1973), where corona-pulse count increases with temperature.    eglecting these partial discharges is a risk to design. All circuits should be tested at operating  temperatures and pressures with sensitive instruments. When signals from high-voltage circuits  show unexplained or unpredicted noise, especially if the noise is temperature dependent, the  engineer should carefully investigate possible partial discharge activities within the circuitry.  Such partial discharge will initially produce only noise, but in time, the conformal coating may  crack or debond, exposing a bare electrode that would then provide a supply of free electrons,  resulting in system failure.  encapsulated circuits. An example of an improperly bonded surface on a capacitor is shown in  figure 7, Delaminated High-Voltage Capacitors (Dunbar, 1983). Applying high voltage to the  capacitor will ionize the gas in the crack, heating the gas and the insulation surfaces, and further  increasing the outgassing rate. Gas escaping from the cracks alters the pressure-spacing  dimension, generating circuit noise. Continuous partial discharges eventually overheat the  insulation, enlarge cracks, and ultimately can produce voltage breakdown.             illers are sometimes added to an encapsulant to enhance structural strength. For example, if the  filled encapsulant is poured over a coil winding or over the end of a stranded wire, voids will be  created, usually either between windings or between the windings and metal core where partial  discharges can occur. Figure 8, Insulation Deterioration on the Coil Winding, shows the resulting  deteriorated insulation on the coil winding. The figure shows a cut away view of an encapsulated  coil at three different magnifications. The clear region around the coils indicates that the potting  compound merely covered the wires without penetrating the regions between them, creating a  void chamber in which the charged conductors can interact through Paschen discharge. The outer  surface of the insulation is only slightly pervious to the products of internal outgassing and will  allow the internal pressure to rise toward the Paschen minimum for the spacing involved.  Initially, most voids are between 1\uf0b410-3cm (0.4 mil) and 5\uf0b410-2 cm (20 mil). The pressure at the  Paschen minimum for these voids is between 20 and 750 Torr. This pressure can be sustained  with continuous outgassing through infinitesimal outgassing ports.                   development test should be made to prove that the encapsulation process has successfully  precluded voids, cracks, and improperly bonded regions. For transparent encapsulants, it is  recommended that sample discs of the potting material be poured. Cracks, voids, and  delaminations are easily detected through a polarizing lens. Translucent and opaque materials  require either a destructive examination or a very sensitive measurement of partial discharges.  hile the chief concern for the designer is usually the contamination that results in a system-  induced environment, there is another concern that, in many cases, will be more important. It is  generally assumed that circuit and surface potentials present throughout the system at all times  are known in advance because of design. Electromagnetic effects on systems and spacecraft  surfaces can dramatically alter these potentials, leading to achievement of CIV and subsequent  breakdown. In this section, we review electromagnetic effects on systems and spacecraft  surfaces.                  riboelectric charging occurs whenever two dissimilar materials come in contact with each other  and then separate. One material pulls charges (mainly electrons) from the other, leaving the first  one (the one with the excess electrons) with a positive charge and the second with a negative  charge. An example of this occurs when a space vehicle flies through moisture containing ice  crystals. The ice crystals lose electrons to the spacecraft. As a result, the spacecraft ends up with  a large negative potential because of the accumulation of this negative charge (Tanner and  Nanevicz, 1961). As more ice particles impinge upon the surface of the spacecraft, charge will  accumulate until the corona threshold is exceeded. Then, corona may initiate, with the corona  discharge current equaling the charging current. It is a good approximation to regard triboelectric  charging as a constant current source.  composed of dielectric or dielectric-coated sections, in contrast to a metal skin. Charge  accumulated on a dielectric material cannot easily flow away from the point of deposition.  Charge thus accumulates on the surface until the electric field along the surface is large enough  to support a streamer discharge over the dielectric surface to a nearby metal structure. If the  dielectric strength of the insulator is exceeded before the streamer occurs, however, then the  charge may be relieved by a spark discharge that punctures the dielectric and travels to an  underlying conductor. Streamer discharges, like spark discharges, seek the lowest impedance  path to the vehicle structure. During the course of its operational life, a spacecraft may encounter  a number of sources of triboelectric charging. Natural sources include cosmic dust and  micrometeoroids while manmade sources arise from materials spalled by cosmic dust impacts  with spacecraft surfaces, outgassing products, and small particles arising from various orbital  debris interactions.  effects occur with them as with other dielectric materials. Streamer discharges from windshields  and windows are a source of radio frequency (RF) noise (Rupke, 2002).  xhaust from the rocket motors and jet engines may not be considered a detrimental effect.  Before any conclusive measurements on rockets were made, it was assumed that the rocket  engine could have one of three effects on the electrostatic potential of the spacecraft:    ase a.\u2014If the engines were capable of charging the vehicle to the potentials above the vehicle  threshold potential, then corona discharges and EMI would accompany each launch. (This is the  worst-case scenario.)  ase b.\u2014When the conductivity of the exhaust is sufficient to limit the vehicle to some value  below the corona threshold potential, then there will be no corona discharges or associated EMI  related to engine charging. Other charging sources, however, still could cause corona discharge.             Case c.\u2014If the rocket engine exhaust was so effective a discharger that the vehicle would be  held below the corona threshold even when other charging sources were present, then the rocket  engine would tend to alleviate, rather than aggravate, the vehicle charging problem. (This is a  positive effect.)   exhaust is an excellent discharger (Case c) (Nanevicz and Hilbers, 1973). Similarly on Voyager  (and many other spacecraft) it was reported that the rocket exhaust could be \u201cheard\u201d in the VHF  antenna experiment due to a global discharge of the spacecraft when the engines were fired.  Jet engine exhaust, being at a lower temperature, corresponds to the second possibility (Case b).   and rapid rise time related to turbulence are able to produce RF noise over a broad spectrum.  This interference may disable radio receiving systems and, in some cases, may induce spurious  pulses in the electronic systems controlling stage sequencing and vehicle guidance.   ne other place where the effect of vehicle charging can be damaging is where the conducting  sections of the vehicle are not properly connected together. For example, when a rocket vehicle  is charged triboelectrically on the forward surfaces and discharged from the skirt at the aft end  and the forward section is not electrically connected to the aft section, then charge acquired on  the forward section cannot flow to the aft section freely. Thus, the vehicle is differentially  charged, unless the potential difference between the sections becomes large enough for a spark  discharge to occur. This electrical isolation occurs as a result of improper electrical connection at  the interface of two sections. When a spark or arc discharge event takes place between  differentially charged sections, it may be destructive, depending on the magnitude of the  discharge.  hese spark discharges can be quite energetic, since the capacitance between the sections may be  several thousand picofarads and the sparkover voltage may be several kilovolts. Furthermore, the  spark discharges will seek the easiest electrical path between the sections. If there is some  electrical wiring routed across this gap, it is possible that the spark will travel through a shorter  gap from the front section to the wiring and then through another short gap to the aft section.  This, of course, would put a tremendous noise pulse on any data line. Also, there is the  possibility that these spark discharges could fire electro-explosive devices when they are onboard  and in the vicinity of the sparkover site. In the past, electro-explosive devices on rockets have  occasionally been initiated by corona or streamer discharge (Bennett, 1968). The development of  the current NASA Standard Initiator (NSI-2) included prevention of such initiation as a priority  design goal (Roberts Research Laboratory, June 1988). This effort was successful as more than  20 years of experience with this NSI has shown no problems with electrostatic discharge  initiation. For other electro-explosive devices, discharges between unbonded sections especially  present a real danger; therefore, proper connection between sections of the spacecraft is essential.           t had been conjectured that electrostatic discharges could occur between stages as they are  separated. In fact, it was shown that the separation of two dissimilar objects could cause  substantial voltage difference between the bodies (Haffner, 1966). Experiments by Nanevicz and  Vance (1966) have shown, however, that the two parts of the staging vehicle will be electrically  connected through the conductive exhaust plume as long as the motor plume is in contact with  the expended stage. It does not seem conceivable that significant differences in potential, that is,  more than a few tens of volts, can be developed between separating sections during a staging  event in which the upstage motor is ignited at or before the time of stage separation. For launch  vehicle designs where tens of seconds can pass between stage separation and upper stage ignition  (e.g., Saturn 5), engineers must be aware of the electrostatic risk.   t has been found that a high-resistance conductive coating over the dielectric surface is quite  effective in eliminating streamers and the noise they cause. The conductive coating drains away  the charge as rapidly as it arrives and prevents the electrostatic potential buildup, which can  produce streamer discharges. The coatings (Schmitt, 1972) used for nontransparent dielectrics  are usually opaque and have a surface conductivity (the inverse of surface resitivity) on the order  of a 1 M\uf057-1. Most windshields are made of either glass or acrylic plastics. Glass has a lower  surface resistivity (1\uf0b41012 \uf057) than the acrylics (1\uf0b41016 \uf057). This is attributed to the open silica  network in glass that allows hydration. It has been shown that a surface resistivity of 1\uf0b4108 \uf057 is  sufficient to bleed off accumulating charge (Schmitt, 1972).   fused into the glass exterior surface to sufficient depth that erosion should not seriously reduce  the conductivity of the external surface coating during the life of the windshield.    corona-generated noise. In one case involving a loop antenna on an aircraft, it was shown that  correct placement reduced the noise factor by 25 dB (Tanner and Nanevicz, 1961). It was further  shown that at least 25 dB of noise suppression can be obtained with dipole antennas if two of  them are correctly placed and balanced.                               unbar, William G.

In  this section, we will characterize the interactions that result when high-voltage systems are  exposed to these environments. In the following sections, we will review electromagnetic fields  within materials, break-down phenomenon in gaseous and solid media, and cover interactions of  high-voltage systems with a plasma environment typical of Earth orbits.  density, high-power packaging design. For high-voltage equipment, additional emphasis should  be placed on electromagnetic field stress and material selection and application. The following  section gives an overview of electromagnetic field calculations for common geometry in electric  power system construction.    o select and design insulation for electrical equipment properly, it is often essential to make  plots of the field distribution. As technology advances, the structures become more and more  complicated and analytical methods to calculate the electric field lines and potential gradients  become less effective. Therefore, numerical methods are being developed to calculate field lines  and potential gradients. Currently, there are many computer package programs to simulate  electromagnetic fields for a given structure. These programs operate based on either finite-  element or finite-difference techniques. Also researchers have developed in-house computer  programs to meet specific applications.  hese field-plotting techniques are used to determine the maximum stress value in the  configuration for both operating and test voltages. From the breakdown field (Es) for an  insulating medium, the breakdown voltage (Vs) can be approximately calculated from the  relationship (Ryan, 1967 and Ryan and Walley, 1967):     n practice, for the breakdown voltage calculation, \uf068 is numerically equal to the required voltage  de-rating, because it is equal to the ratio of the field stress between parallel plates and the  maximum field at the smaller electrode of a non-uniform configuration with identical spacing.  For the breakdown voltage calculation, Es is usually taken as the breakdown field in the uniform  field case.  g is the electrode separation  \uf068 is the utilization factor, defined as the ratio of average to maximum gradient in the gap.                         a function of electrode spacing are shown in figure 9, Utilization Factor for Various Electrode  Configurations (Dunbar, 1988), for several electrode geometries.    configuration, can also be used to estimate the minimum electrode radius for a given spacing  when the electrical stress capability of the dielectric is known. The utilization factor is  numerically equal to the required voltage de-rating of a configuration. In equation form, it is           example, in kV/mm)  Em is the maximum electric field strength within the space between two conductors spaced at  some distance apart (for example, in kV/mm).   treatise on electric field theory can be found in most texts on electricity and magnetism or  fields and waves. Von Hippel (1954), Greenfield (1972), and Schwaiger and Sorensen (1932)  have written texts on dielectrics that explain the basic principles from field theory. A small  sample of the many relevant texts describing field plotting and analysis are those by Moore  (1927a and 1927b) Bewley (1948), Smythe (1968), Stratton (1941), and Weber (1950).                   or electrodes of any given shape, the variation in potential as a function of the distance from  one electrode to the other electrode can be calculated by solving the differential equations for the  electrostatic field. For simple geometries, such as parallel plates, concentric spheres, and coaxial  cylinders, the equations for the field strength (Schwaiger and Sorensen, 1932) are given below:   Ex is the voltage gradient at a distance x between the electrodes in V/cm  V is potential at the electrodes in volts  s is the spacing between the electrodes in cm   2  1+2      r1 is the inner sphere radius  r2 is the outer sphere radius both in cm        1  2  r1 is the inner cylinder radius  r2 is the outer cylinder radius both in cm  Em is the maximum field gradient at the inner conductor surface in V/cm                                   r is the radius of the spheres (cm)  x is the distance between them (cm)  This is the case where two spheres are located side by side with a gap between them.     1  (/2)\u2212  )          r is the radius of the cylinders  s is the distance between them   n empirical field equation or formula is the shortened, simplified form of a complex equation.  Complex equations, manageable with computers, have traditionally been viewed as difficult and  time consuming to use in everyday design work, especially if the design has to be assembled  piecewise. This is changing with the availability of considerable computing power even in  mobile devices suitable for field work. It is still sometimes advantageous to use empirical  equations for first-order estimations. Furthermore, maximum stress is often the only value  needed in a design, and the plotting of the complete field using a complicated equation is not  necessary. Empirical equations for the maximum field stresses at the smaller electrode spacing  for several electrode configurations are given in table 2, Maximum Field Strength (Em) with a  Potential Difference (V) Between the Electrode Configurations (Bowers and Cath, 1941).

Empirical equations for sparkover gradients in air and sulfur hexafluoride  are published by Mattingley and Ryan (1973) for the configurations shown in figure 9. As an  example, the sparkover electric field for parallel cylinders, at atmospheric pressure in air, was  found to be equal to:       ar  \uf02b  r     ar  \uf02b  r        \uf02b  a/  r    \uf0d7     r   ar  \uf02b  r      \uf0d7    r.  32   ar  \uf02b  r      \uf0d7   r.  32  2  V/  \uf02b  r  a/  r        \uf0d7  V/  r   2  \uf02b  a/  r                ;   where          \uf065   V  1  a  \uf065\uf02b\uf065 a    21  12       0.605  a                                                           where  r is the radius of the cylinders (same for both cylinders) and is 0.098 \uf0a3 r \uf0a3 4.64 mm.       n solids, as in gases, the start of repetitive ionization is the beginning of dielectric breakdown.  Since solid insulation generally has much greater dielectric strength than gaseous insulation,  corona is expected to occur first in the gas surrounding a homogeneous solid dielectric  supporting the electrodes. The CIV in gases can be determined by using established breakdown  curves for various gap distances and electrode configurations because the measurements in the  literature show that the breakdown voltage of a gas in a uniform field is the same as the CIV for  that gas. However, an electrical system is composed of gaps or voids, dielectric material  supporting the electrodes, and electrode material, forming various shapes and electric field  distribution within. Then, the problem is establishing the applied voltage distribution between the  gas and solid portions of the dielectric to predict breakdown threshold voltages. This complex  structure can be modeled in terms of capacitors in series with different dielectric constants to  evaluate the overall system\u2019s dielectric strength. Table 2 shows the potential of two dielectrics  between parallel plates. The potential of capacitors in series can be determined using this  information.   each wire\u2019s insulation and the voltage across the space between the insulation. This voltage  distribution is unlike that encountered in series capacitors where the voltage across the air  capacitor is proportional to the voltage across the solid-insulation capacitor for all applied  voltages. With parallel wires, the thickness of the insulation is constant around the wire, but the  thickness of the gap between wires varies from a minimum in the space between the wires to a  maximum from the far side of one conductor to the far side of the other conductor. This results in  a nonlinear electric field as shown in figure 10, Typical Field Plot of Conductors Showing  Curvilinear Squares from Intersecting Equipotential and Field Lines (MSFC-STD-531).   Figure 10\u2014Typical Field Plot of Conductors Showing Curvilinear Squares From  Intersecting Equipotential and Field Lines                 ound, solid-insulated conductors have a unique field stress, which depends upon the insulated  conductor\u2019s construction and its position with respect to a ground plane. In the case where there  is an air spacing between two solid-insulated round conductors, the electric field configuration is  more complicated, especially as the gas density decreases to a value where the Paschen  minimum is reached. For example, for an insulated wire next to a ground plane, the minimum  spacing will be the thickness of the insulation to the ground plane; for a twisted pair  configuration, the minimum spacing will be twice the thickness of the insulation. Depending on  the operating pressure, the possible breakdown paths, which correspond to the Paschen  minimum, are shown in figure 11, Cross-Sectional View of Twisted-Pair Wire and Wire-to-  Ground Configurations Showing Possible Corona Sites at High Pressure (shorter path) and Low  Pressure (longer path) (MSFC-STD-531, High Voltage Criteria).   Figure 11\u2014Cross Sectional View of (a) Twisted-Pair Wire and (b) Wire-to-Ground  Configurations Showing Possible Corona Sites at High Pressure  (Shorter Path) and Low Pressure (Longer Path)  molecules in the presence of an electric field. After the primary collisions produce new electrons  and ions, these charged particles will gain energy from the field. If the field exceeds some  threshold potential, a fully developed discharge will be established within the electrodes as  electrons multiply through collisions with the molecular gas. Additional electrons are produced  from charged particles colliding with the electrode surfaces. The result will be a fully developed  gaseous discharge. The initiation of this discharge is usually referred to as \u201cthe electrical  breakdown\u201d or \u201cgaseous breakdown.\u201d    aschen\u2019s Law states that the breakdown voltage of a gas in a uniform field is constant if the  product (pd) (where p is the gas pressure, and d is the distance between spaced parallel plate  electrodes), is held constant (Paschen, 1889; Meek and Craggs, 1978). Paschen's Law dictates  that for all gases, the function V = f (pd) has a typical form with a distinct minimum. Gas  breakdown voltage has been shown to also be affected by electrode material and configuration,  and by operating temperature. Paschen\u2019s Law is valid over a wide pressure region, except  pressures beyond 2 to 3 atm and pressures below 10-7 Torr (Von Hippel, 1954). Note for highest                accuracy, at an absolute temperature T (in K) differing from room temperature (T0 = 293 K), the  breakdown voltage should be read at the abscissa value of (pd)\uf0b4(T0/T) (Kind and Karner, 1985).  As gas pressure is increased from standard temperature and pressure, the breakdown voltage is  increased because at higher gas densities the molecules are closer together, and a higher electric  field is required to accelerate the electrons to ionizing energies within the mean free path. The  breakdown voltage decreases as gas density is decreased from standard temperature and pressure  because the longer mean free path permits the electrons to gain more energy before a collision.  As density is further decreased, the voltage decreases until it reaches a minimum value. When  the density is further decreased, the breakdown voltage starts to increase because the density of  the gas is not sufficient to sustain a chain reaction of any ionization at that potential. Finally, the  pressure (therefore, the density) becomes so low that most electrons travel from one electrode to  the other without colliding with a molecule. Examples of Paschen curves for several gases are  shown in figure 12, Breakdown Voltage of Several Gases as a Function of pd at Room  Temperature (Dunbar, 1988).   n some cases, there will be a gas other than pure air surrounding the wire, cables, parts, and  components. Pure air has a relatively high CIV characteristic for either coated or insulated  conductors that allows transients of 320 to 350 V-peak to exist in a corona-free region,  depending on insulation thickness and dielectric properties. Other pure gases such as helium,  hydrogen, and nitrogen or mixtures of one or more of these gases with air during a purge may  result in a lower breakdown voltage characteristic, since the breakdown characteristic is also a  function of the gas composition as well as the pd values. The breakdown voltage of helium as a  function of the product pd is shown in figure 13, Paschen Curve of Helium as a Function of pd at  Room Temperature. A mixture of 10 percent hydrogen in air will have a breakdown voltage of             0.91 times that of pure air, as shown in figure 14, Breakdown Voltage of Hydrogen-Air Mixture  as a Function of Hydrogen Percentage in Air.   Figure 14\u2014Breakdown Voltage of Hydrogen-Air Mixture as a Function of Hydrogen  Percentage in Air  he Paschen minimum voltage for air, which is 327 Vdc, occurs at a pd dimension of 0.7 Torr-  cm at room temperature (23 \uf0b0C). Wires and parts may have spacing from less than 0.1 mm to a  few centimeters, depending upon the construction, application, location, and shielding  requirements. This implies that some parts within the electrical system may be subjected to either  voltage breakdown, corona, partial discharges, or glow discharges when the space vehicle is at  altitudes greater than approximately 12.19 km (40,000 ft) during launch and approximately 9.15  km (30,000 ft) during reentry. The reason for the lower altitude during reentry is the higher  temperature and inhibited airflow into the compartments during reentry.  here possible, it is advisable to design high voltage systems so that the separation between  high voltage surfaces is smaller than the electron mean free path for a collision. The pressure               corresponding to minimum CIV depends on the spacing of the electrodes. For a 1-cm spacing in  air at room temperature, this pressure occurs between 0.5 and 1.0 Torr. A representative  minimum CIV for air is 327 Vdc. In comparison, the CIV for the same contact configuration at  760 Torr (1 atm) is 31.2 kV.  n general, for each electrode spacing there is a unique pressure at which minimum CIV occurs  as shown in figure 15, Corona Onset Voltage Between Parallel Plates at Several Spacings  (Dunbar, 1966). Thus, the minimum CIV will occur over a wide range of altitudes in the  electrical system on a space vehicle having many components with a variety of spacing between  conductors, contacts, and terminations. The minimum pd dimension is constant for a wide  pressure variation and for many spacings inside a space vehicle. Since the CIV and breakdown  voltage of a gas are functions of gas density and spacing (pd), the corona or breakdown can start  when the pressure between closely spaced (2 mils or 5.1x10-3 cm) electrodes is as high as 125  Torr and continues through to the longest distance between an energized electrode and a ground  plane, until a pressure of less than 0.02 Torr (spacing = 20 cm) is obtained (Dunbar, 1966).  Initially this appears extreme until the designer can visually observe the length of the breakdown  path between an electrode on a card and the furthest metal ground plane.   t should be noted that the pressure between electrodes is different from the external pressure and  would be greatly reduced through ventilation as the vehicle is traveling between Earth and space.  In some instances, the time lag can exist until well after the vehicle reaches orbit altitude because  of outgassing of insulation and containers within the vehicle.              depend on an external source of ionization as well. There is generally a time delay between the  application of voltage and corona. This time delay varies statistically and is a function of the  difference between the applied voltage and the critical voltage. Ultraviolet (UV) and high-energy  radiations reduce the time delay considerably.   hen radioactive cobalt-60 or a gamma emitter is used as an ionizer, it affects corona in three  ways. First, it lowers the CIV of the gaseous environment slightly; second, it raises the intensity  of the intermittent corona; and third, it may alter the mechanical and electrical properties of the  insulation to make the material either more or less corona resistant. Irradiated polyethylene is an  example of a material that is changed by radiation to be more corona resistant. Its increased  corona resistance after irradiation results from an increase in ability to shrink and bond to itself  to form a structure with fewer voids (Von Hippel, 1954). Radiation effects on dielectric materials  are investigated by Stojadinovic et al. (2001); Mackersie et al. (2001); Amjadi (2000); Krieg et  al. (2000); Given et al. (2000); and Lee et al. (2000).  sustaining, hence are extinguished. The region from Vg to the critical voltage is called the  Geiger-counter regime (Loeb, 1965). The frequency of the pulses in this region generally  depends on the intensity of the external ionizing agents present.    n the space environment, the ambient temperature variation can be large because of solar  heating effects. The onboard instrumentation and power systems are designed to operate in this  wide ambient temperature range, typically from negative 55 \uf0b0C to positive 155 \uf0b0C for vehicles in  low Earth orbit. In addition to this ambient temperature variation, the instruments can see local  temperature changes related to dielectric losses, partial discharges, corona discharges, electrical  breakdown, or fully developed arc or glow discharges. This section discusses testing needed to  ensure that high voltage systems can operate under conditions of significant temperature  excursion. Failure to do so is potentially catastrophic since the physical effects discussed with  respect to test will also occur in operations.         0   where  T0 is room temperature in K (293K)  Tt is operating temperature of the equipment in K (maximum temperature of the equipment)  P0 is nominal operating pressure in Torr  Pt is test chamber pressure in Torr               lso, the breakdown voltage may be related to temperature and altitude by using the U.S.  Standard Atmosphere\u2014Pressure chart, which gives the air-density factor as a function of  altitude. Thus, for corona test purposes, it is possible to simulate any altitude and temperature in  a room-temperature chamber containing gas at an appropriate pressure. However, this simulated  test environment ignores higher order effects from chemical and thermal dielectric deterioration,  which would occur at a temperature other than room temperature.  likelihood of corona, glow discharge, or electrical breakdown. Any sustained discharge will heat  the gas locally (around conductors) as well as in enclosed spaces (voids). The resulting  temperature rise will change the extinction voltage, thus giving inconsistent results. This effect  has less impact in the vicinity of the Paschen minimum. Readings at higher pd values will be  influenced by temperature rise during the test. When testing for partial discharges in voids of  solid dielectrics, internal temperature rises because of sustained discharges affecting CIV and  CEV. When the walls of the void are heated by dielectric losses, the insulation outgases,  changing the gas pressure and possibly the gas mixture inside the void. This affects the voltage  difference between the CIV and CEV across a simple void in a solid dielectric, resulting in test  results that are not representative of operational conditions. When testing for pd or corona, test  engineers must keep in mind that testing itself can temporarily alter the sample. Caution should  be taken to obtain valid data.    having two different fixed spacings are shown in figure 16, Corona Between Nichrome Wires in  Heated Chamber (Dunbar, 1988), and figure 17, Corona Initiation Voltage as a Function of  Temperature and Pressure for Parallel Wires in a Heated Chamber (Dunbar, 1988). The test data  indicate a small variation in the minimum CIV at temperatures between 500 and 1100 \u00b0C but little  or no change from 23 to 500 \u00b0C.              Figure 17\u2014Corona Initiation Voltage as a Function of Temperature and Pressure for  Parallel Wires in a Heated Chamber  hen subject to high temperature, molybdenum and tungsten sensors, conductors, and parts are  to be protected from oxidation by either an inert gas or vacuum environment. In addition, when  molybdenum materials are located in an oxidizing atmosphere they should be isolated to prevent  molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) formation from evaporating and depositing on cooler parts. The  CIV data, as a function of temperature and pressure, obtained between two MoO3-contaminated  titanium wires spaced in a depressurized air-filled chamber is shown in figure 18, Corona Onset  Voltage of Nickel-Clad Wires in a Molybdenum-Contaminated Oven. The wires did not corrode  or show signs of evaporation at temperature less than 500 \u00b0C. As the temperature was increased,  MoO3 evaporated and deposited on the cooled vacuum chamber walls. The multitude of MoO3  molecules between the conductors carried the conduction current when a voltage exceeding the  CIV was applied to the wires (Harwood, 1958).            that can interfere with the operation of other equipment. In one study, when the frequency  spectrum of the noise generated by discharges between parallel wires was measured at three  pressure-spacing (pd) dimensions, the following results were obtained (Dunbar, 1983).    . As pressure is decreased to 30 Torr, the higher frequencies are attenuated  significantly as shown in figure 19, Frequency Spectrum at Corona Pressure (Dunbar, 1983).  . Two situations exist for the low-pressure region. For glow discharge inception, the  frequency range is from 15 to 30 kHz as shown in figure 20, Frequency Spectrum at 0.75 Torr,  647 Volts for #16 AWG Solid Copper Wires Spaced 4.8 cm (Dunbar, 1983). The data were  taken between parallel wires using EMI test requirements and equipment. However, if the  voltage is raised to include streamers (sparking) within the glow discharge region, which is an  over-voltage of at least 30 V-peak above glow discharge initiation, the frequency spectrum  increases to the values shown in figure 21, Frequency Spectrum at Glow Discharge Pressure  (Dunbar, 1983).  Figure 18\u2014Corona Onset Voltage of Nickel-Clad Wires in a  Molybdenum-Contaminated Oven                 Figure 20\u2014Frequency Spectrum at 0.75 Torr, 647 Volts for #16 AWG  Solid Copper Wires Spaced 4.8 cm                  These data are important when measuring corona discharges at low pressure with corona system  test equipment. As an example, test equipment that has a low-frequency cut-off at 40 kHz will  not detect the lower frequencies of glow discharge at initiation. The low-intensity radiated  emissions spectra produced by a glow discharge may not be considered detrimental to electrical  and electronic system hardware, but this should be confirmed by comparison with the  certification performance data for the hardware under consideration.   a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Although nitrogen has a much lower breakdown  characteristic than oxygen, a highly electro-negative gas, the presence of oxygen in nitrogen will  raise the breakdown voltage as shown in figure 22, Onset Voltage of Gases and Gas Mixtures  between 0.25-in. Round Rods (Dunbar, 1966). Other outgassing products and gases will also  combine with the nitrogen-oxygen mixture, but the small quantity will not have any significant  effect on the total breakdown characteristic.                 he breakdown voltage between a pair of 5.0-cm diameter parallel plate circular electrodes  spaced 0.2, 2.0, and 5.0 cm apart was determined for pure helium, pure oxygen, and helium-  oxygen mixtures. The data shown in figure 23, Parallel Plates in Helium-Oxygen (Dunbar,  1966), imply that corona and voltage breakdown can appear on the bare or very thinly insulated  conductors of a 200 V-rms ac electrical system when the mixture contains more than 80 percent  helium by volume. Such a system would require special corona and voltage breakdown  precautions.   the helium-oxygen gases. The test results are shown in figure 24, Round Rods in Nitrogen-  Oxygen Gas Mixture (Dunbar, 1966). These curves show that the CIV cannot be determined by a  linear interpolation of the component gases. For some gas mixtures, there are pressures and  spacings where the CIV is less than that of either component gas. Either neon or argon when  mixed with oxygen shows this characteristic.                    lights to keep the starting or initiation voltage within acceptable limits for display purposes.  These gases, if used in spacecraft hardware, should be kept away from high voltage to avoid  corona issues.   ost high-voltage breakdown and partial discharge information available in the literature has  been developed for 60-Hz utility power system equipment. In spite of the lack of information for  systems operating above 60 Hz, spacecraft electrical and electronic designers have used  published power system partial discharge and corona testing techniques and data for power  conversion designs with reasonable success. However, it was determined early in the space  program that the use of very low frequency partial discharge criteria leads to failures when  applied to high-frequency, high-density packaging, specifically when non-sinusoidal frequencies  greater than 20 kHz were introduced for weight and volume saving (Bunker, 1970). Fortunately,  many of the early designs used vacuum tube technology, which included reasonably slow rise  times compared to today\u2019s high-speed switching devices. Instead of determining the cause of the  failures for the early power conversion components, it was agreed among engineers that  spacecraft high-voltage packages should have average electric field stresses less than 2000  V/mm and maximum field stresses less than 5000 V/mm. This field stress limitation reduced the  failure rates to acceptable limits.  ater, experimental data published in August et al. (1967) and August and Chown (1970)  showed that the high-frequency breakdown between conductors spaced greater than 0.04 cm              apart was considerably less than the breakdown voltage at very low frequencies for pd values  greater than 50 Torr-cm. For very closely spaced electrodes (less than 0.04 cm), the breakdown  voltage was the same for frequencies from 50 Hz to 2 MHz for pd values greater than 50 Torr-  cm. At pd values greater than Paschen minimum, Paschen\u2019s Law does not hold for high  frequencies (figure 25, Breakdown at High Frequency in Air in Inhomogeneous Field (Prowse,  1950 and Lassen, 1931), and figure 26, Breakdown at High Frequency in Air (Smaller Values of  (d/mm)) in Inhomogeneous Field (Pim, 1949).              Figure 26\u2014Breakdown at High Frequency in Air (Smaller Values of d (mm))  in Inhomogeneous Field  During the first reported spacecraft high-frequency electronic failure (Bunker, 1965 and Bunker,  1970), it was assumed that the breakdown phenomenon that occurred at pressures between  1 Torr and vacuum were related to high-frequency effects. This led to the development of the  voltage breakdown versus high-frequency breakdown curve shown in figure 27, Variation of RF  Breakdown Voltage With Pressure Illustrating the Pressure Transition Region From Gas  Discharge to Multipactor (August and Chown, 1969, and August and Chown, 1970). This curve  was based on the limited information published in the book by Meek and Craggs (1978) plus the  high-frequency and multipactor voltage breakdown reports given in Prowse (1950); Lassen  (1931); Pim (1949); Labrum (1947); Hughes Aircraft Company (July 1966); Vaughn (1968);  Mohr and Putz (1966); Lewis and McCarty (1966); Wachowski (1964); Woo (1968a); Ishamaru  and Woo (1967); MacDonald and Brown (1949); and Herlin and Brown (1948). The subject of  multipactor is developed more fully in section 6.3.5.                 Figure 27\u2014Variation of RF Breakdown Voltage With Pressure Illustrating the Pressure  Transition Region From Gas Discharge to Multipactor  he breakdown voltage for very low RF frequencies is the same as the dc value; however, at  high frequencies, the breakdown mechanism is complicated by electron resonances resulting in  cumulative ionization. Hence, lower breakdown voltages are experienced relative to those  predicted on the basis of dc (Bunker, 1966).  igure 28, Breakdown Voltage for a 0.4-mm Gap in Air at Atmospheric Pressure as a Function  of Frequency (Prowse, 1950), is a plot of data in the literature and is limited to pressure-spacing  dimensions greater than 30 Torr-cm for frequencies where multipaction is not an issue. This  curve is presented based on available data in the literature: region A is by Lassen (1931), B is by  Pim (1949), and C is by Labrum (1947). The curve intends to illustrate main features only, since  continuous observations over the whole range of frequency do not exist.  Figure 28\u2014Breakdown Voltage for a 0.4-mm Gap in Air  at Atmospheric Pressure as a Function of Frequency                 As solid-state devices developed, switching speeds increased. Also, improved magnetic material  development led to power conversion repetition rates ranging from 20 kHz to over 100 kHz.  Further, high-density packaging development progressed through the selection of higher  frequencies. With these developments, physically smaller electrical parts reduced the spacing  between small rounded surfaces and part volumes and weights, forcing designers to pay more  attention to the electrical field stresses within the insulation system.   Configuration and Spacing, shows the results of an experiment (Dunbar et al., 1998) to  determine the corona initiation of a long antenna in a very large diameter vacuum chamber.  Measured parameters were the CIV and CEV at frequencies from 60 Hz to over 60 kHz at  pressures of 10 to 50 Torr. The results of these experiments concluded that the corona initiation  in air was reasonably stable from 60 Hz to 40 kHz. As seen in the curve labeled \u201cantenna,\u201d the  CIV decreased above 40 kHz to 85 percent of the 60 Hz value. This was a significant finding,  implying very small conductors or square-edged conductors, as used on printed circuit boards,  surrounded by an air gap will have lower CIV when the frequency exceeds 40 kHz for pd  dimensions greater than 50 Torr-cm. The data in figure 29 are taken from published literature.  Dotted lines are expected (or extrapolated) curves, and the large dots are the data in the literature.

Normally,  the EMI test is determined in a \u201croom ambient\u201d environment. For the partial discharge part of the  test, the test article should be placed in a vacuum chamber, if viable, to simulate the operational  environment. For spacecraft equipment, the test pressure should be adjusted to assure coverage  of the Paschen minimum pd dimensions for the test article while conducting EMI measurements.  By comparison of the radiated emissions signature at one atmosphere pressure with those at             lower operational pressures, differences in the frequency spectra can be identified that may be  attributed to glow discharges and partial discharges. The discharge frequencies to be assessed are  well defined by Pfeiffer (1991a and 1991b) and Pfeiffer et al. (1987). Note that published data  indicate the breakdown voltage in air between parallel plates spaced less than 1 mm apart is  constant from 20 Hz to 100 kHz (Prowse, 1950; Lassen, 1931; Pim, 1949; Labrum, 1947;  Dunbar et al., 1998; Pfeiffer, 1991a; and Buchalla, et al., 1992).   little change in the Paschen minimum from 50 Hz to 2 MHz for breakdown between parallel  plates. Above 2 MHz, there is a drastic drop to the multipactor breakdown region, which  continues up to 200 MHz. Above 5 GHz, the minimum breakdown voltage rises again, because  the multipactor phenomena are not observed since the resonant electrons cannot keep up with  this high frequency of the field. (Walter and Hershberger, 1946; Herlin and Brown, 1948;  Prowse, 1950; He and Hall, 1984; Sato and Haydon, 1984a and 1984b; Damas and Robiscoe,  1988; Seebok and Koehler, 1988; Suganomata et al., 1989; Vlieks et al., 1989; Bourat and Joly,  1989; Saito, 1995; and Galstjan and Ravaev, 1995).  s more data become available, it is recommended that a plot of voltage breakdown as a  function of frequency be made available to engineers developing high-density packaging for  spacecraft. In the meantime, designers are encouraged to use the following partial discharge  initiation voltage information shown in table 3, High-Frequency Voltage Breakdown Criteria  (Woo, 1968a).    0.06 to 980 kHz  0.06 to 40 kHz  60 kHz to 1.0 MHz  950 MHz to 3 GHz  60 GHz  VOLTAGE  (V-PEAK)  327  327  260  39  327   Parallel plate (spaced: 0.01 to 0.04 cm)  Antenna  Antenna and sharp edges  Waveguide (all metal)  Waveguide  handbook, Graves (2014), captures much of the work done in the past ten years and will prove an  invaluable reference.    is a resonant RF discharge, sustained by the emission of secondary electrons from the walls of  the RF devices such as waveguides and RF connectors. Multipactor breakdown may occur when  secondary electrons are produced on an electrode surface and are accelerated in a gap toward  another electrode surface so that they reach the second electrode in a half-period of the applied  RF field. Upon striking the second electrode, the electrons create new secondary electrons, which  are accelerated back across the gap toward the primary electrode during the next half-period,            producing more electrons there, as shown in figure 30, Multipactor Discharge: Electron  Resonance in an RF Field With Discharge Sustained by Secondary Emission (Dunbar, 1983).  These electrons accelerated across the gap gain their energy from the applied RF field (Hughes  Aircraft Company, 1966; Wachowski, 1964; Woo, 1968a and 1968b; and Galan et al., 1988). For  most materials, the secondary electron emission yield, that is, the ratio of emitted secondary  electrons to the number of incident electrons becomes greater than unity if the impact energy is  sufficiently high. Thus, the number of electrons participating in a discharge increases when the  coefficient of secondary emission is greater than 1.0 and multipactor breakdown occurs.  Occurrence of a multipactor discharge depends primarily on the RF voltage and frequency levels,  gap spacing, electrode surface condition (roughness and cleanliness), secondary electron  emission coefficient of the electrode material, and the operating pressure (vacuum environment).  Since the multipactor discharge is an electron resonance phenomenon, it is independent of the  nature of the gaseous environment under which the RF system is operating.  n practical systems, operating pressure is usually very low such that the mean-free-path of  electrons for collision with molecules is much larger than the gap length, (d), and the voltage  level is in a range such that the accelerated free electrons can gain the right amount of kinetic  energy from the field to be in resonance.  Figure 30\u2014Multipactor Discharge: Electron Resonance in an RF Field  with Discharge Sustained by Secondary Emission  enerally speaking, the existence of multipaction does not imply an immediate component  failure. However, long-term effects, such as erosion or physical damage of the cables and other  component surfaces, may lead to an eventual failure. For instance, it is possible for multipaction  to occur in a transmitting antenna in which only a small percentage of the transmitted power is  dissipated in the multipactor, resulting in localized heating. The result in decreased or increased  radiated power and an increase in the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) may be negligible,  and the system may continue to operate with no other adverse effects. On the other hand, if the  antenna were used in a duplex system where transmitting and receiving occurred simultaneously  on different channels, the antenna noise caused by the multipactor may blank out the receiving  channel and thus make the system partially inoperable. The total system should be considered to  estimate the effects of multipaction with respect to system performance.  multipaction will not occur. Frequency-temperature-pressure testing should be required to ensure  product multipactor-free acceptability.              Although a multipacting breakdown is a resonance phenomenon, it is not required that a unique  set of operating conditions occur (Nanevicz and Vance, 1967; Hughes Aircraft Company, 1966;  and Galan et al., 1988). There is a wide range of combinations of gap spacing, operating  frequency, and voltage over which multipacting may be observed. However, there is a lower  threshold voltage below which the discharge does not occur. In addition, for a given electrode  spacing, there exists a cut-off frequency below which the discharge does not occur. Multipactor  discharges can occur over a wide range of frequencies above the cut-off frequency. Furthermore,  in a configuration where more than one path length is available, less frequency selectivity would  be experienced.  Multipaction is usually experienced at frequencies greater than 70 MHz. The effect of  multipacting on the Paschen curve over a range of pressures is illustrated in figure 27.  Multipaction does not occur until the mean free path is larger than the gap, that is, below the  Paschen minimum. Most communications between a spacecraft and a ground station take place  at frequencies in the 20 MHz to 30 GHz range. The design and fabrication practices for this  frequency range are different than for 60 Hz-ac or dc systems.  he transmitting system is affected in many different ways by multipaction (Hughes Aircraft  Company, 1966). There is some RF power lost in exciting the electrons. When sufficient gas  molecules are present, ionization can occur, which can cause corona with the resultant  breakdown between plates. The impact of the electrons on the surface can cause heating and  outgassing. When the load on the RF source is reactive, it causes detuning of the output circuits.  Multipaction would usually generate higher order harmonics in the output of the transmitter.  Also, RF noise is generated by multipactor effects, which can interfere with nearby receiving  equipment. All these effects may not happen at the same time, and the antenna may be perfectly  useful as a radiator after a breakdown. However, its efficiency with respect to total radiated  power will be drastically reduced as shown in figure 31, Power Decrease Caused by Multipactor  (Dunbar, 1983), for an RF coupler with intermittent multipaction. These symptoms of  multipactor effects should not be interpreted as indication for other failure modes.   lectrode spacing, frequency, electrode configuration, and the applied voltage are all to be  considered when evaluating design parameters for the elimination of multipaction. Figure 32,  Possible Regions of Multipacting Between Parallel Plates (Dunbar, 1983), displays one set of  relationships among those parameters. The top scale is electrode separation divided by  wavelength, both in the same units. The three regions indicated by 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 are where  multipacting can occur. The electrons that correspond to the region marked 1/2 have a transit             time of T/2, where T =1/f. Those in region 3/2 have a transit time of 3T/2, and 5/2 is 5T/2.  Unfortunately, a general plot of this sort cannot be relied upon for design data, because the  values depend on factors such as the number of electrodes, electrode material, surface conditions,  and geometry, for example, parallel plates, coaxial, or edges. The designer is forced to test each  design at various stages of fabrication to be certain that multipacting does not occur.          When considering the use of foam, the designer is to consider the density of the foam, its  application, the gas enclosed in the cells, and the cellular breakdown of the foam. For some  applications, the foam may be ineffective or detrimental as a function of time in the presence of  temperature cycling.  xamples of breakdown discharge data for parallel plate electrode configuration are shown in  figure 33, Multipactor Discharge Characteristics of Various Surface Materials as a Function of fd  for Two Different Operating Frequencies (430 and 100 MHz) for Parallel Plate Electrode  Configuration, Hughes Aircraft Company (1966), for several electrode materials as a function of           fd, the operating frequency (f) times electrode separation (d) for two frequencies. These data may  be used to closely estimate the minimum breakdown voltage for a particular fd dimension and a  particular electrode material. Specifically, the data show that dielectric materials have higher  multipactor initiation voltage than the metallic electrodes (Hughes Aircraft Company, 1966).  Therefore, using an anti-corrosion coating (dielectric material) on waveguide internal metallic  surface improves the multipactor initiation voltage. The anti-corrosion material needs to be only  a few microns thick, but it must be well bonded to the waveguide metallic surface (100 percent  bonding).         Figure 33\u2014Multipactor Discharge Characteristics of Various Surface Materials as a  Function of fd for Two Different Operating Frequencies (430 and 100 MHz) for Parallel  Plate Electrode Configuration           Multipactor effect and breakdown can also be seen in coaxial transmission lines or coaxial  electrode geometries operating in the space environment (Woo 1968a; and Ishimaru and Woo  (1967). Figure 34, Multipacting Region for Coaxial Electrodes With Varying Values of b/a  (Woo, 1968a), shows the RF breakdown voltage data as a function of fd obtained for coaxial  electrodes in vacuum where b and a are the radius of the outer and inner conductors,  respectively.   n summary, multipactor breakdown is a hazard that may occur in RF equipment subjected to  low-pressure space environments. Components such as printed circuit boards, conventional  wiring, multi-pin connectors, and variable capacitors have all experienced multipaction in space.  Failure experience usually initiates with multipaction, followed by dielectric heating, materials  outgassing, and finally gaseous breakdown. Potting, foaming, or dielectric coatings tend to  reduce the risk of multipactor breakdown phenomena; however, small open voids between  electrodes within a foam or improper coating may result in multipaction. As a rule, foam  products are considered a poor choice because there is a high probability of open pores between  closely spaced electrodes. Using a solid dielectric is the best way to eliminate multipaction.  However, joints and connectors with very small spacings between mated surfaces can result in  multipaction. Printed circuit board and component cleanliness is mandatory. Dust particles or  small setae will result in lowered multipactor voltage breakdown. Pressurization of RF             containing a conductive contaminant may produce enough heat to generate a track of carbon.  This conductive path tends to reduce the capability of the insulator to hold off the voltage and  may result in electrical breakdown. The surface erodes without producing a track in some  materials. Fillers effectively reduce the tracking tendency of organic materials. Eroding  materials, such as acrylics, do not require filler protection. To lengthen the surface creepage path,  tracking can also be controlled by reducing the voltage stress on the surface by applying petticoat  insulation configurations. A bibliography on surface flashover, surface creepage, and tracking on  or within solid insulation is cited in Bashara et al. (1965); Billings and Humphreys (1968);  Billings et al. (1967); Billings et al. (1971); Chapman et al. (1955); Dakin and Mullen (1972);  Frisco and Chapman (1956); Kurtz (1971); Mason (1960); Orbeck and Niemi (1973); Toriyama  et al.

In time, surface erosion and exposure to UV radiation will degrade the epoxy-based  laminate to a level inferior to the porcelain.  igure 35, Flashover Test Fixture (Dunbar, 1988), shows the test fixture used to evaluate the  flashover voltage measured between 1.9 cm-diameter washers mounted on an uncoated glass  epoxy-bond laminate. The flashover voltage initiation as a function of spacing is shown at three  frequencies in figure 36, Effect of Spacing on the Initial Values of Strength for Fixture Shown in  figure 35 (Dunbar, 1988).

Finally, the correct  choice of materials and configuration is very important as shown in figure 33.

Figure 37, Variation of Flashover Voltage with Changing             Insulation Dielectric Constant (Luck, 1967), is an illustration showing the advantage in selecting  the correct dielectric constant. The flashover breakdown factor in the illustration represents the  results of many measurements, showing how a decreasing flashover voltage can be expected  across the dielectric when insulations of progressively higher dielectric constants are used.     ll materials have lower flashover strength at higher frequencies. The example given in figure 38,  Effect of Frequency on Flashover Strength for Configuration Shown in figure 35, illustrates that the  surface flashover strength changes magnitude with frequency. The flashover strength of glass-cloth  epoxy-based laminate (G-10) is shown at three different frequencies as a function of spacing in air  at 23 \u00b0C in figure 36, and the effect of frequency on surface flashover for polyethylene (PE) is seen  in figure 39, Effect of Frequency on the Electric Strength of PE. Further, table 5, Polyethylene  Dielectric Strength (in V/mil) for 30-mil Sheets as a Function of Temperature and Frequency  (Luck, 1967), and table 6, Teflon\u00ae Dielectric Strength (in V/mil) for 30-mil Sheets as a Function of  Temperature and Frequency (Luck, 1967), show the dielectric strength of PE and Teflon\u00ae  (respectively) as a function of frequency and temperature (Luck, 1967).                  imited data indicate improvement or degradation of the flashover properties of materials when  the system is subjected to a combination of magnetic field and impulse voltages. Few effects are  noted for magnetic fields less than 3 to 4 Tesla. For higher magnetic fields, the flashover strength  is either improved or degraded, depending on the polarization of the interacting fields (Korzekwa  et al., 1989).    t is useful to determine the relationship between flashover strength at 25 \uf0b0C and other  temperatures. For gaseous breakdown in a uniform field, this relationship involves the ratio of  the gas densities at the two temperatures. To test this relationship, it is only necessary to multiply  the 25 \uf0b0C value by the factor (25 + 273)/(T + 273), which is the inverse ratio of the absolute  temperatures involved. This ratio is part of the well-known air density correction factor, which is  commonly used in spark-gap measurements over a considerable range of density and gap  spacing. However, this may not hold true for surface flashover, because there are other factors,  such as outgassing, surface charging, and triple point effects, involved in surface flashover  events. Figure 40, Effect of Temperature on 60-Hz Flashover Stress (Dunbar, 1988), displays the  effect of temperature on a 60-Hz surface flashover stress. The broken lines in this figure show  the values obtained when this factor is applied to 25 \uf0b0C flashover values. Thermionic emission  does not become a factor until the temperature approaches 700 \uf0b0C for most metals or until the  material tends to change state via severe outgassing or polymerization. As a rule, the flashover  voltage appears to increase as temperature in the system increases as shown in tables 5 and 6.

Ice and snow do not appreciably reduce the effective flashover strength. The  selection of insulating materials resistant to surface wetting and moisture absorption will greatly  facilitate the maintenance of original flashover strengths. A water-repellent treatment will aid on  materials that are easily wetted. As an example, table 7, Environmental Effects on Surface  Flashover at 60 Hz, shows environmental effects on flashover for glass cloth and polystyrene. A  safety factor of 2 is recommended where humidity can go to 100 percent with condensation.  Where dirt, dust, and residual ions from plating baths, etc., may contaminate the surface between  electrodes, the flashover (creepage) path should be made to be 2 to 3 times the minimum air  spacing.                  85 \u00b0C (dry)  125 \u00b0C (dry)  25 \u00b0C (100% RH)  50 \u00b0C (100% RH)  25 \u00b0C (100% RH)  50 \u00b0C (100% RH)  1 HOUR  7.8  7.0  9.5  8.8  1.7  10.3    a3.6  a2.4  a2.5  a2.4  9.0  9.4  a2.5  a2.4   9.4  9.3  5.5  5.1  Glass cloth  (kV)  Polystyrene  (kV)  aInternal flashover.   electromagnetic spectrum. A typical dielectric material (solid or liquid) may have four distinct  resonant regions as shown in figure 41, Dielectric Polarization (Dunbar, 1988). Between these  resonant frequencies, the dielectric constant appears to have constant values for the real part of  the dielectric constant as a function of frequency. These resonances are the result of polarization  induced by the applied field at that particular frequency. The distinct regions correspond to  different physical mechanisms by which the material responds to the time-varying electric field.  At very low frequencies, the material tracks the field through all four mechanisms so they all  contribute to the polarization and the resulting change in dielectric constant. As the frequency  increases, each mechanism in turn becomes unable to keep up with the field and ceases to  contribute.   the imaginary part (k\u2033). In general, the interfacial polarization (\u03b1s) may occur at up to several  thousand Hertz, depending on the temperature and relaxation time of the material. The dipole  polarization (\u03b1d) would occur from 104 to 1012 Hz. Raising or lowering the material temperature  can respectively increase or decrease the resonance frequency for both of these effects, shown  graphically as curves T1-T3. The atomic polarization (\u03b1a) is in the visible and near infrared  frequency range, and the electronic polarization (\u03b1e) occurs at frequencies above the optical  frequency range (cosmic rays such as x-rays, vacuum UV, and other radiation frequencies).  When a material is operated at a frequency that includes one or more of the polarization regions  (resonant frequencies), the dielectric will absorb energy from the field, resulting in dielectric  heating.                                          ielectric materials used for electronic designs should be evaluated for a change of dielectric  constant as a function of frequency to determine polarization effects. The dielectric constant of  many materials as a function of frequency is given in Von Hippel (1954). The interfacial  polarization is broadband and may be further broadened by wide temperature excursions. This  implies that an electronic circuit should be evaluated through the full operating temperature  range, instead of the temperature extremes (Greenfield, 1972).   electrical properties. Dielectric strengths and dielectric constants are well documented for  high-voltage materials. Fewer data are available, however, on the dissipation factor, also called  loss tangent, which is defined as       is the ac conductivity  \u03c9 is the frequency in rad/s.  \u03b5 is the permittivity   Elevated values of the dissipation factor cause the dielectric heating in the insulation system and  result in power loss. There are some frequency ranges for a given dielectric material for which  the dissipation factor is above the acceptable design requirements. The system should be                operated in a regime where the dielectric constant has a constant value over the operating  frequency and temperature ranges, and the dissipation factor should be relatively low to avoid  dielectric heating and instability of the impedances. If the dielectric properties are functions of  temperature, operating conditions have to be controlled to provide stable and predictable system  performance. Most measurements of dissipation factors are made at 1000 Hz and 23 \u00b0C, but  quite often the insulation has to function between 400 Hz and 1 MHz and at \u201340 to +200 \u00b0C. As  a result, the designer has the problem of measuring the dissipation factor or searching for  meaningful data and tends to extrapolate whatever data are available to the desired frequency  range. This may be an important problem because electronic circuits, if operated near the  frequency singularities, can be affected by fluctuating inter-electrode capacitance changes (Von  Hippel, 1954; and Greenfield, 1972).   of the particular polarization involved becomes equal to or less than the period of the applied  field. In general, \uf061s is effective up to several thousand Hertz; \uf061d can be effective from 104 up to  1012 Hz, and even this wide range can be increased further into the low-frequency area by  reducing temperatures; \uf061a becomes effective in the infrared spectrum and \uf061e in the optical region  and above.   the statistical average breakdown of constant thickness samples. These values should be used  with caution in equipment design for the following reasons:      or example, the following four figures from Dunbar (1968), show the effect on the dielectric  strength data for Kapton\u00ae-H film taken at different environmental and mechanical conditions:                 Figure 42, Temperature Effects on ac Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, figure 43,  High Humidity Effects on the Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, figure 44, Insulation  Thickness Effects on Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film, and figure 45, Film Area  Versus Dielectric Strength of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film.                   n spacecraft applications, the highest average operating temperature for a unit is usually  specified (60 \u00b0C is typical). This temperature should not be taken as the insulation design value.  The insulation design temperature has to be that of the hottest point within the equipment. For  instance, the hot spot created by high current densities near an electrical component may be as  much as 20 \u00b0C higher than the nominal temperature in the insulation.  ost insulation test samples are either 1 or 5 mil thick. In high-voltage work, thin insulation has  insufficient dielectric strength, often requiring composite insulations having several layers. The  dielectric strength (V/mil) of insulation decreases with thickness, as shown in figure 44.   data sheets. A deviation of dielectric strength can be caused by roughness of electrode surfaces  and non-uniform thickness of the manufactured insulation. Because of these effects, a de-rating  of the manufacturer\u2019s data is generally needed. For areas of a few square centimeters, a less than               5-percent de-rating of the manufacturer\u2019s dielectric strength data is usually sufficient. For large  areas, the required de-rating is considerable, as shown in figure 45.  Finally, it should be noted that recent work indicates that many quoted values of dielectric  strength are in error as the samples were not properly outgassed, dried out, etc. This has become  a particular issue in space applications where materials need to be tested at very low  temperatures, high vacuum, and under radiation environments. For a discussion of problems and  issues with previous dielectric measurements, see Dennison (2014).  he first published treeing experiments were demonstrated by Kitchin and Pratt (1962). In that  work, a sharpened sewing needle was partially embedded in a block of polyethylene and used as  one of the electrodes. The base of the square block, 2.5 cm by 2.5 cm by 6.5 mm thick, was  placed on a metal plate that served as the other electrode. The voltage was adjusted until one half  of a group of samples initiated a \u201ctree\u201d within one hour. This was named \u201cthe characteristic  voltage.\u201d  ver the years, investigators have argued about the initiation mechanism of an electrical tree. A  probable cause is the bombardment of the surface of the insulation adjacent to a high electrical  field stress by high-energy electrons. The source of the electrons may be high-intensity  ionization in a void, the field emission from the surface of a point, or the emission from an  impurity embedded in a non-homogeneous insulation system.  spreads along the molecular interfaces rather than atomically. Thus, the tree branches may  disperse throughout the insulation, eventually resulting in electrical failure. Experimentally, it  has been determined that the tree is often initiated by a large electrical pulse inducing charges  exceeding 200 pC. Furthermore, partial discharge pulses are recorded as tree branches extend  from the initiating point toward the base plate. The branches may move upward as well as  downward in their continual path of least resistance toward the ground plane (McMahon, 1978;  and Mason, 1960). An example of electrical treeing is shown in figure 46, Electrical Treeing in  Plexiglass (author: Bert Hickman). In the figure, high voltage breakdown within a block of  plexiglass creates the beautiful fractal pattern known as a Lichtenberg figure. The branching  discharges ultimately become hairlike, but are thought to extend down to the molecular lever.  While extremely dangerous in high voltage insulation, the effect is often used to create works of  art as shown.   here are several types of treeing. Much activity has been given to water tree growth in utility  power cables in recent years. In addition, the chemical inclusions of sulfur and other debris have  been found to serve as initiators for treeing (Tabata et al., 1971; Dissado et al., 1988; and  Steennis and Kreuger, 1990).          n this section we discuss breakdown between insulated wires with respect to CIV and CEV. In  figures 47 to 50, we note that for all wire samples the CIV is larger than CEV, as expected. The  tests reported here were also used to study temperature effects on aging and a more detailed  description of test methodology is given in section 6.4.8.2 below. Twisted-pair insulated  conductors have a higher CEV than a single insulated conductor to a ground plane configuration,  as shown in figure 47, Corona Initiation and Extinction Voltages of Sample T1, Twisted Pair and  Wire-to-Ground Configuration Shown in Figure 11, as a Function of Pressure. An \u201cas-received\u201d  wire sample T1 was used in these data. For a twisted pair, there are two dielectrics in series with  the gas-filled space between the two insulations on the conductors. When gas breakdown  calculations were made, it was found that the effective gas-filled gap was approximately 10 to 30  percent larger between the twisted pair as compared to the insulated wire to ground plane.   across the wire insulation and the voltage across the gap between the wire insulation and the  ground plane. The insulation around the conductor has nearly constant thickness, but the gap  spacing between the solid dielectric and ground plane may vary from 0.017 cm to over 1 cm at             very low pressure as shown for samples P1 and R3. The CIV and CEV curves for these samples  are shown in figure 48, CIV and CEV Data for Sample P1 Type Wire, and figure 49, CIV and  CEV Data for Sample R3 Type Wire. When the pd dimension attempts to remain at the Paschen  minimum in the varying gap distance, the voltage across the solid dielectric decreases, reducing  the insulation effectiveness to a minor role, as shown in figures 48 and 49. The insulation  effectiveness is shown for test samples R2 in figure 50, CIV as a Function of Altitude (Pressure)  of Sample R2 Aged Several Hours at 304 \u00b0C. These data are obtained after 20-h thermal soak at  304 \u00b0C before testing at 288 \u00b0C.  Figure 47\u2014Corona Initiation and Extinction Voltages of Sample T1, Twisted Pair and  Wire-to-Ground Configuration Shown in Figure 11, as a Function of Pressure                 Figure 50\u2014CIV as a Function of Altitude (Pressure) of Sample R2 Aged  Several Hours at 304 \u00b0C              high-volume resistivity reduces heating of the dielectric. Values greater than 1012 \u2126-cm are  adequate for most power equipment. High-voltage insulation should have a volume resistivity  greater than 1014 \u2126-cm. Polyamides in high-voltage service should be operated at temperatures  lower than 200 \u00b0C, as suggested in figure 51, Volume Resistivity of Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film at 1  kHz (Dunbar, 1988). Surface resistivity has to be greater than 109 \u2126 to prevent tracking and  surface flashover events. New insulations usually have surface resistivities greater than 1012 \u2126 at  23 \u00b0C and 50 percent RH. This value becomes much lower at higher humidity and temperature  values. If the surface resistivity is reduced from 109 \u2126 to 108 \u2126 by contamination, a significant  surface leakage current will flow. This will form a \u201cdry band\u201d on the surface of the dielectric. In  some cases, the dry band can be bridged by a small electrical discharge when the stress locally  exceeds the breakdown stress of air at the air-solid interface. Consequently, local heat from the  discharge will decompose the insulation and form a conducting path on the surface. With time,  the paths will propagate, forming a tree, and resulting in eventual breakdown (Chapman et al.,  1955).   breakdown in this report. Unfortunately, any sustained discharge will heat the gas locally  (around conductors) as well as in enclosed spaces (voids). The resulting temperature rise will  change the extinction voltage, thus giving inconsistent results. Therefore, the elapsed time  between CIV and CEV is critical to the accuracy of the test results. This effect has less impact in  the vicinity of the Paschen minimum. Readings at higher pressure-times-spacing values will be  influenced by temperature rise during test.                As an example, the impedance between asbestos-insulated nichrome as a function of temperature  and pressure in contaminated MoO3 gas is shown in figure 52, Impedance of Two-Conductor  Shielded Cable in Molybdenum Trioxide Vapor (Dunbar, 1966). The shunt impedance between  conductors poses a serious problem for thermocouple wires and instrumentation wiring inside a  braided stainless-steel shield.   hen testing for partial discharges in voids of solid dielectrics, internal temperature rise related  to sustained discharges affects CIV and CEV. When the walls of the void are heated by dielectric  losses, the insulation outgases, changing the gas pressure and possibly the gas mixture inside the  void. This affects the voltage difference between the CIV and CEV across a simple void in a  solid dielectric, resulting in test results that are not representative of operational conditions.  ging is the end result of chemical and physical changes in electrical materials or electrical  systems, resulting from the passage of time. There are several aging processes, such as thermal,  electrical, mechanical, radiation, and chemical. Both thermal cycling and chronological aging  diminish the dielectric and tensile strengths of dielectric materials and potted compounds. Most  early aging studies were performed using thermal stress as the prime degradation process where  a 10 \u00b0C temperature increase above nominal operating conditions for an electrical insulation  resulted in 50 percent decrease of life. Aging criteria were refined by the use of the chemical  theory of Arrhenius (Dakin et al., 1954), which describes the effects of temperature on the speed  of a chemical reaction. There are a number of excellent articles relating aging to temperature and  time (Dakin et al., 1954, and Hewitt and Dakin, 1963), and the article by Cooke (1983) shows  the changes in the slope of the Arrhenius plot with respect to several insulating materials.              Most manufacturers\u2019 data provides only the 1-min dielectric strength test results conducted at  23 \u00b0C and 60 Hz between 0.5-in.-diameter electrodes, telling little or nothing about the aging  characteristics of the material. Figure 53, Life as a Function of Voltage for Kapton\u00ae Type-H  Film (Dunbar, 1988), shows aging data for a polyethylene film exposed and unexposed to corona  at two different operating temperatures.   he characteristic life of a material can be evaluated as a function of temperature when data are  plotted as Arrhenius plots (figure 54, Heat Reduces the Time for Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film to Fall to  Half of Original Dielectric Strength). The baseline dielectric strength in figure 54 is 7000 V/mil,  for 1 in2 at 23 \u00b0C, 50 percent RH, and 60 Hz.    . When the statistically developed breakdown voltage of the withdrawn samples is 50  percent of the initial 1-min breakdown voltage, the end of life is assumed to be reached for the  specific sample at that temperature.                   Figure 54\u2014Heat Reduces the Time for Kapton\u00ae Type-H Film to Fall to Half of Original  Dielectric Strength  ife testing should be conducted at several temperatures to obtain significant, useful data.  Table 8 Life Field Stress (1 h) (Dunbar, 1988), shows the maximum field stresses for 1 h of  operation of three generic-type encapsulating materials. The lower values are for very thick  insulations. Higher values are for insulation less than 10 mil thick.  Table 8\u2014Life Field Stress (1 h)  MATERIALS MAXIMUM FIELD  Epoxies  Silastics  Urethanes  STRENGTH  (V/MIL)  200 to 350  300 to 600  250 to 500  ote that the data in table 8 are for 1 h life only, not 10,000 h. To obtain 10,000 h, the maximum  stress has to be decreased considerably. The voltage stress has to be decreased by 8 to 10 percent  for each order-of-magnitude increase in service life. For 10,000 h, the stress should be decreased  to about 65 percent of the values shown in table 8. Figure 55, Insulation Life as a Function of  Field Stress (Dunbar, 1988), can be used as a generic curve that may help in design work. This  curve shows the voltage stress in V per mil as a function of life. This generalized curve has  already included many insulation de-rating factors normal to electronic circuits. Not included are  frequency, temperatures greater than 85 \u00b0C, and units with volumes greater than 500 in3.              encapsulation, bonding, and voids. Use of the term \"void-free\" to describe an electrically  insulated set of electrodes does not imply the insulation is flawless; it means that the insulation is  free of any \u201csignificantly large\u201d voids. However, as time passes and insulation deteriorates, small  voids will increase in size, resulting in higher energy discharges and ultimately in insulation  failure.  nother life-degrading factor is frequency. Tests have shown that insulation life is inversely  proportion to the ac operating frequency. When frequency, temperature, and voltage stress de-  rating factors are all combined, insulation with a rating of 10,000 V for the 1-min test may be  reduced to less than a few hundred volts in operational application (Nelson, 1974; Morel et.  al.1980; and Montanari and Pattini, 1986). To further demonstrate the life temperature failure  rate, the Arrhenius plot of insulation life as a function of temperature is shown in figure 54.  rediction of material aging is an estimation of probabilities rather than an exact science,  because of material chemical composition variables as well as processing and workmanship  variables. Finally, there are the aging variables, such as environmental and electromechanical.  Therefore, it is readily seen that a simple formulation that may adequately determine the aging  quality of a specific material under a specific application may be in error for another material.  t became obvious to several researchers that partial discharges and corona degraded polymeric  materials much faster than temperature alone (Dakin et al., 1954; Hewitt and Dakin, 1963;  Cooke, 1983; Nelson, 1974; Morel et al., 1980; Montanari and Pattini, 1986; Montanari, 1990;  Dixon, 1990; Yianakopoulos et al., 1990; Cygan and Laghari, 1990; and Stone et al., 1992).   and models for materials aging under electrical, temperature, mechanical, radiation, and  chemical stress conditions were developed (Montanari, 1990; Dixon, 1990; Yianakopoulos, et  al., 1990; Cygan and Laghari, 1990; Stone, et al., 1992; Montanari, 1992; Khachen and Laghari,  1992; Densley, et al., 1993; Kimura, 1993; Simoni, et al.; Bruning and Campbell, 1993; Sanche,             1993; Li and Unsworth, 1994; Khachen and Laghari, 1994; Agarwal, 1995; Montanari, 1995;  Gulski and Krivda, 1995; and Dissado, et al., 1995).   important for the space industry to evaluate accelerated aging of materials for specialty  applications.    n general, insulation aging is accelerated at elevated temperatures. Aging effects due to  temperature were apparent in the study discussed in section 6.4.5. The test samples in this study  consisted of many identical specimens. Each sample type, such as R3 (figure 49), included 10  identical specimens for each temperature setting. One specimen was removed for test evaluation  following each 10 percent of total test time until 100 percent test time in thermal and temperature  cycling was achieved. The specimens removed were visually inspected; the corona was tested  and the sample was then preserved until the end of the test program. Thus, Sample P1 started  with 80 specimens for the 8 different temperatures. This accounts for a variation from specimen  to specimen related to physical dimension variations during wire manufacture and the  mechanical attachment to the corona test fixture.  amples R2 shown in figure 50 demonstrate corona test results following thermal aging. The  information from these data indicates that the CIV decreased somewhat as a function of thermal  cycling time. Indeed, one specimen had a melted spot on the insulation, giving it a lower partial  discharge reading at the higher temperatures. However, all the undamaged specimens were  visually and mechanically tested and passed. Within 20 percent of test time, the specimens at  both temperatures failed, and the CIV decreased. The visual test indicated a very roughened  surface. Following a mechanical wrap-unwrap test, many cracks were found along the full length  of the specimen, indicating failures.  insulation composition. Parameters for each material of the composite insulation system that are  to be considered are dielectric constant, volume resistivity, surface resistivity, and thickness. The  other parameters are conductor size, configuration, the environmental pressure, and temperature.  Insulated conductor configurations include coaxial, shielded, wire-to-ground plane, twisted pair,  and proximity to an adjacent conductor or ground plane. These parametric configurations are to  be carefully considered when designing interconnecting wiring.    he ac CIVs for many insulation compositions were also tested during the study referred to  above. The metal conductors were all the same diameter to obtain consistent results; however,  the insulation materials and processing for each test sample varied by manufacturer. Composite  and glass covered insulation systems differed but they appeared to have less variation in CIV as  shown in figure 56, Minimum CIV of Several Wire Types and Wire Sizes (Dunbar, 1966). The         single dielectric insulation systems, such as Teflon\u00ae-insulated wire, were not affected by the high  temperature.    differ somewhat from other test samples of similar composition because of supplier materials  and manufacturing processes. Samples with similar thickness were selected to show the effects  of dielectric constant when tested with ac. The dc applications are controlled by the volume and  surface resistivities rather than by dielectric constant.    thickness on the CIV/CEV. The greatest variance in insulation thickness was found for  composite insulation systems. Significant variances were observed because of the following  parameters: the number of Teflon\u00ae layers, the type of Teflon\u00ae insulations applied to the  conductor, and whether the insulations were applied as an outer cover or jacket, all of which led  to a wide variance in CEVs, as shown in figure 57, Minimum CIV as a Function of Insulation  Thickness.

Vol. 25, No. 4, pp. 693-701.     he primary purpose of an electrical insulation is to isolate one conducting surface from another  and from their surroundings, restricting current flow to the conductors. Many insulation designs  have the additional functions of supporting the parts and structural components in their exact  position to eliminate electric field overstresses from vibration, shock, and structural  deformations. They also serve in efficient heat transfer from the parts to a thermal controlled  surface. High-power, high-voltage spacecraft equipment is densely packaged, and the denser the  packaging is, the more functions the electrical insulation is required to perform.   should be knowledgeable. The designer should know the mechanical, thermal, and electrical  properties of each material used in the potted circuit and should be aware of the compatability  between the materials associated with all parts, components, and structural members.  Encapsulating materials are critical to proper and reliable operation and aging of the electronic  circuits. They provide the electrical insulation between parts of different voltages and provide a  thermal path for transfer of heat from the heat-generating sources. Proper selection and  application of the encapsulating material is critical to the success of the manufacturer\u2019s design.                    Because improper selection or application are the source of many of problems, it is important  that the manufacturer has a thorough understanding of the encapsulating material and processing.  application and design. It is best to evaluate these processes for each application before a design  starts. One supplier may be a specialist in one material and processing, therefore this supplier  should be considered first. A study related to these issues can be found in Harper et al. (1979)  and Dunbar (1988).    complicated and difficult to use. They are best avoided unless absolutely necessary and have  been qualified to be used in specific applications. The materials used in Hughes/Northrop  Grumman (December 1995) are well defined and easily applied with minimum development by  materials engineers.  ome equipment is pressure sensitive and is designed to operate only at high vacuum, for  example, at pressures less than 1.33\uf0b410-3 N/m2 (1\uf0b410-5 Torr). Therefore, it is recommended that  pressure switches be installed in the flight vehicle to shut down the experiment at higher  pressures, that is, pressures greater than 1.33\uf0b410-3 N/m2 (1\uf0b410-5 Torr).  hen pressure sensors are installed near equipment containing gases other than air, the pressure  sensors may require calibration in a gaseous mixture similar to that anticipated in operation. For  instance, the continuous leakage of gas A and the purging of gas B and/or gas C may result in a  unique mixture, which may require the pressure sensors to be calibrated for that particular  gaseous mixture.  f operational requirements or test protocols permit, pressure-sensitive equipment should be  powered down whenever pressure approaches the Paschen minimum. Equipment that must  operate near the minimum should be carefully monitored and will need to be de-energized as  rapidly as possible if a pressure surge occurs. There should be a requirement that the pressure  sensors have inputs to the power system automatic control system, if one exists, so that the  pressure-sensitive equipment can be turned off in time to prevent permanent damage. Override  control circuitry should be installed to compensate for a failed pressure sensor circuit.   nstrumentation computer space, weight and volume restrictions, and system complexity restrict  the number of pressure sensors that may be installed inside the high-voltage instrumentation  compartment. First, the pressure sensors may be limited to the most sensitive circuit or  instrument. Second, the instrument should be essential either to the operation of the spacecraft or  an essential part of the mission objectives. The sensors may be placed next to the pressure-  sensitive instrument, in the instrument compartment, or near the instrument outgassing port  where external pressure can be sensed before compartment pressurization.               nsulation degradation related to aging occurs at all voltages, including the very low voltages  associated with solid-state devices. Water-induced corrosion, oxidation, and chemical reactions  all enhance the aging process of electrical insulation systems. More rapid degradation is caused  by over-voltage electrical stress, partial discharges, and corona usually associated with, but not  limited to, high voltage. Some properties of different voltage regimes are investigated in the  following paragraphs.    hen the appropriate conditions exist, corona can occur at any voltage level greater than the  ionization potential of the material. The 0 to 50 V region is usually considered corona-free for dc  voltages and low-frequency ac peak voltages (less than 500 MHz). This also assumes that the  environment temperature is less than 250 \u00b0C and free of concentrations of noble gases and  radioactive and other contaminants known to lower the CIV.   not exist, provided the following good workmanship practices are performed during design,  packaging, assembly, and test:                                           his voltage range is usually considered corona-free for dc voltages and sinusoidal ac peak  voltages with frequencies less than 50 kHz. This also assumes the ambient temperature is less  than 250 \u00b0C, and free of concentrations of noble gases and radioactive and other contaminants  known to lower the CIV.    hen the voltage stress in air is less than 50 V/mil (2000 V/mm), creepage and tracking should  not exist, provided the following workmanship practices are followed during design, packaging,  assembly, and test, in addition to the precautions stated for the 0 to 50 V ranges:                                       insulation is provided. Sharp bends and clamps can generate standing waves at high frequency  and result in breakdown.                                                                 Pressurizing with hermetic sealing or total encapsulation may be required for circuits that operate  at voltages above 5 kV and at pressures between 1\uf0b410-5 to 100 Torr (1\uf0b410-2 and 1\uf0b4104 Pa). A gas  with a high dielectric strength and large molecules, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), is  recommended to assure leak-free operation for long periods of time.             A summary chart for system voltages operating in air and other gases is shown in table 9, Power  System Voltages.

Encapsulation (potting) is defined as the immersion of all electrical  and structural components, circuits, and printed circuit boards into a liquid insulation, which,  when cured, forms a void-free solid insulation.    difficult to find. Mechanical and chemical data are usually abundant; however, the electrical data  are a simple tabulation of constants, with no hint of how these constants will vary with respect to  operating conditions. Most published data need to be adjusted or translated for the application at  hand.  electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties that need to be considered for solid  insulation. Sometimes, solid potted insulation is specified to be transparent so that the packaging  engineer can assess parts stressing and bonding. Weight, water adsorption, and outgassing are  often specified. Most important for all categories of high-voltage insulation is life, which is  dependent upon the electrical stress and environment.

Resistance to  aging by light  perating voltage, frequency, temperature, ambient gas composition, pressure, radiation, and  structural requirements must be known when designing insulation for high-voltage equipment.  This includes the steady-state operating voltage as well as higher voltage transients, their  duration, and their frequency of repetition.   of construction, circuit boards are to be conformally coated to reduce breakage related to  vibration and shock, to inhibit corrosion and fungus during handling and storage, and to reduce  surface tracking along board surfaces between high-voltage and low-voltage parts, terminations,  or connections. Circuits selected for conformal coatings are to be either limited to low voltage,  installed within a module floating at high voltage, or only operate when the gas pressure  surrounding the board is less than 10-5 Torr. Conformal coatings are put on low- and high-voltage  circuits to prevent short circuits caused by conducting debris that sometimes appears after  launch. The parts on a circuit board are spaced so that the region outside the conformal coating is  quickly evacuated when the system is placed in a vacuum chamber or as the spacecraft is boosted  into orbit. Epoxy and polyurethane resins are the most frequently used materials for conformal  coating.  efore a board is conformally coated, it should be inspected. Flat surfaces mounted parallel to  the board surface should be staked 0.5 to 1.0 mm above the circuit board to allow the insulating  coating material to flow into the space between the parts and the board and fill the voids between  the parts and the board. Then, the following rules apply:  a. All boards, conductors, wiring, and electrical components are to be cleaned according  to the specification before the unit is conformally coated. This includes solder flux, fingerprints,  and particles from the work bench and dust.   a low-viscosity insulation. This is recommended to eliminate the pinholes (continuous leakage  path) and uncoated areas that normally occur in single- or double-coating processes. Application  of the dielectric material may be either by dipping or brushing with each layer applied at right                              angles to the preceding layer. The completed process should be checked with standard tests such  as resistivity or dielectric withstanding.   assembly. If wired, the wire and solder joints are to be cleaned and conformally coated with the  same precaution as the electrical networks on the printed circuit boards after the connections are  made to other boards and subassemblies within the module.  In some cases, a conformally coated board is then potted to attain better bonding. The board and  assembled parts are to be cleaned, and care taken to ensure good bonding at the conformal  coating and potting material interface. Some materials that are used for conformal coatings  include Conathane\u00ae CE 1155 and Arathane\u00ae 5750. Two materials that require a post-cure  vacuum bake to meet the outgassing specification are Hysol\u00ae PC 18M and Solathane\u00ae 113.   voltage areas. This can be accomplished by encapsulating the high-voltage circuitry.  Encapsulation provides the system with mechanical protection from external damage, gives  structural support to the components against shock and vibration, and protects the high-voltage  system from gas discharge damage.   in the subsequent hardware design. In this manner, a total system approach to the design can be  taken, yielding an electronic component with minimum problems that can arise from  encapsulation or potting. This will permit the optimum choice of components, parts, materials,  mechanical arrangements, manufacturing techniques, and the methods of functional and  environmental testing. This approach will reduce the failure probability. In a survey of U.S. Air  Force, NASA, and industry, encapsulated electronics failures fell into the following categories:  High electric stress (packaging); improper selection or use of parts (design); poor bonds, board  delamination (material); and voids, cracks, workmanship, and handling (processes). The  distribution of these failures is summarized in table 11, Summary of Failure Analysis Form  (Stinthal, 1982).

Conformally coated and pressurized circuits require large heavy  enclosures to ensure no leakage. Even then, excessive vibration and mechanical shock can cause  flaws in seals, causing the unit to depressurize, resulting in possible circuit failure.   cases. The workmanship involved during encapsulation should be scrutinized by visual and test  analysis to assure there are no cracks or voids in the finished product. Another aspect of  encapsulated circuits is the number and size of parts. Large volumes are more apt to have voids  and flaws than very small volumes. Materials matching is easier in a unit with a few parts than  when a large number of parts are used in the volume. Therefore, consideration should be given to  the use of encapsulated parts or circuits where necessary, while conformally coated parts and  circuits should be used for the remainder of the unit. Encapsulated parts and circuits should be  carefully considered whenever operating voltages may exceed the Paschen minimum.  Conformally coated circuits may be used for voltages less than 300 V in air, as long as the  circuits are in a debris-free environment.   ther environmental factors affecting insulation are UV radiation, nuclear radiation, and  exposure to solvents and chemicals. Addition of UV radiation and chemicals tends to lower  insulation breakdown voltage, either instantaneously or as exposure and deterioration progress.   ew packaging concepts are to be analyzed and evaluated for large high-voltage spacecraft  modules. In small spacecraft with loads up to 5 kW, solidly encapsulated modules, conformally  coated circuit boards, gas-pressurized modules, and a few liquid-filled modules have been used.  Most of the enclosed gas- and liquid-filled modules had volumes of less than 0.25 m3. Likewise,  most of the conformally coated high-voltage circuit boards operated at voltages less than 10 kV.  Some future high-voltage spacecraft components may require voltages of 50 to 100 kV with  volumes more than 1 m3. This will necessitate new and different packaging concepts, and there  will be reasons for using liquids or gases as insulating materials. These design solutions require  further careful analysis and considerations to prevent leakage and contamination of other  components.   noise. Typically, the noise signature is between 20 kHz and 20 MHz. If the partial discharges are  extensive, noise can also be induced in neighboring low-power level circuits. In high-frequency  systems such as radar, the wave shapes of the electrical signals can carry partial discharge  signals. Furthermore, these partial discharges produce ozone, optical emission, and acid from               oaxial cable shielding is often cured using intense electron beams. This is known under some  conditions to leave a strong charge in the shielding that can lead to unexpected breakdowns and  arcing later. Recent spacecraft anomalies have been attributed to subsequent insulation  breakdown and resulting arcing (Catani, 2007).  decomposition of material, which can cause deterioration of dielectrics. If corona persists for  several hours, the dielectric may start to deteriorate and eventually a breakdown will result.  nternal electrostatic discharge (IESD) results from charge buildup (from the radiation belts) in  cable insulation or in circuit boards (or on isolated insulators inside the spacecraft Faraday cage)  can cause serious arcing and permanent shorts. Designers need to be aware of such effects,  which are addressed in NASA-HDBK-4002A.  he pressure of gas between spaced electrodes in an electrostatic field is a parameter that is  required when determining the location of the Paschen minimum. This gas pressure between  electrodes may differ from the surrounding ambient gas pressure and may vary as a function of  time. With higher temperatures and mechanical stress, air trapped in the insulation layers may  rupture or force voids in the insulation when the surrounding air pressure is reduced. Figure  58(a) Outer Jacket Rupture and (b) Center Conductor Delamination (Dunbar 1988), shows such  voids created by gas trapped in layers near the center conductor and near the outer shield of a  coaxial cable.   ach electrical insulation material has maximum temperature limits and temperature-life limits.  Therefore, it is necessary to know the short-duration temperature and the continuous temperature  exposure, both ambient and local.                 n addition to the fill-gas between electrodes (such as air), there will be outgassing products of  the insulation and the conductor material. Therefore, the Paschen curves will deviate from the  known fill-gas curves, and should not be relied on exclusively.       initiation voltage for point-to-plane electrode configurations is affected by the polarity of the  point. The configuration with the point negative breaks down at a lower voltage. The ac initiation  voltage always corresponds to the lower value as determined by dc polarity experiments.  At high frequencies, the interference generated by partial discharges is worse than at low  frequencies. The rate of deterioration of insulation by partial discharges is usually proportional to  frequency. The dielectric strength of insulators is inversely proportional to frequency. Sample  values of loss of dielectric strength with frequency is shown in tables 5 and 6 in section 6.3.6.4.   he high-voltage insulation design starts with a circuit diagram showing all parts and their  anticipated design voltage levels. The parts are then arranged in a preliminary package, which  minimizes the net voltage between parts and voltage drop across each part. In designing  high-voltage assemblies, it is important to avoid wire and part crossovers that put a low-voltage  surface on one part next to a very high voltage surface of another part. Circuits containing  resistive or capacitive voltage dividers require careful design, especially if the resistor or resistor  string is extended. For example, a resistor or group of resistors may form a voltage divider  between the high-voltage terminal and local ground. The normal plan is to zigzag many resistors  from the high-voltage terminal to the ground terminal or to have one resistor with one end  attached to the high-voltage terminal and the other end grounded. Sometimes, other high-voltage  parts near the center of the resistor or resistor chain may be at full voltage or at ground potential,  stressing a zone that is not normally designed for voltage stress. This is poor design practice and  to be avoided.    electronic equipment and single-pin connectors between electronic packages and high-voltage  power supplies. Closely spaced, small-pin, multi-pin connectors are not recommended for high-              voltage unpressurized equipment, especially if there is a probability that the voltage between pins  will exceed 450 V-peak in the pressure region between 50 and 0.1 Pa.  simulated high-altitude chamber (Dunbar, 1974). Then, the CIV was measured between the pins.  Figure 59, Round Wire Connector (Dunbar, 1988) illustrates the pin construction and indicates  the air gaps of the test article. The tests were performed with the connector shell electrically  grounded and the connecting wires and unwired pins encapsulated with 1.25-mm silicone rubber  on each end of the connector. In the first test, a pair of 22-gauge, twisted, Teflon\u00ae-insulated  wires (0.025-mm-thick) were connected to adjacent connector pins and then fed through the  vacuum chamber wall to the corona test facility. The second test was like the first, except that the  wires were connected to nonadjacent pins. In the third test, one lead was disconnected from the  assigned pin and then reconnected to an adjacent pin on the other mating half of the connector to  eliminate the possibility of partial discharges between the parallel conductors.   insertion and extraction. To do this, small spaces surround each contact. Furthermore, small air  gaps will form about the wire insulation unless the insulation is pressed firmly against the  contact. Many connectors are made with spring-loaded or crimp contacts, which leave an air gap  above each contact as shown in figure 58. These air gaps are ideal for partial discharges, that is,  the air gaps are located in the highest field stress volumes.    he curves obtained from the test data are shown in figure 60, Connector\u201355 Pins in Air at  24 \uf0b0C\u2014Terminals Not Potted (Dunbar, 1988). The data show that the highest CIV was derived  from the test in which the pins were energized from opposite connector halves. In this test, the  initiation voltage for the connector was less than that of wires spaced 5 cm apart (the length of  the connector) and greater than that of twisted, closely spaced conductors. This low CIV  exhibited by the connector is related to air passages within the connector construction, as shown  in figure 59. The design voltage for this connector was too low, between pins, to provide  adequate high-voltage design practice. Curves for the other two tests have corona initiation  voltages equal to those of twisted insulated conductors (Dunbar, 1974).               onnectors are also to be designed to eliminate air voids between conducting surfaces. One  successful method for very high voltage (over 50 kV) applications is to make one side of the  mating-interface from soft, pliable insulation as shown in figure 61, High-Voltage Connector  (Dunbar, 1988). When mated, the pliable insulation conforms closely to the opposite dielectric.  The pliable insulation should first contact the molded insulation near the center conductor, and  then the contact should progress out to the shell without trapping air between the two contact  surfaces. A thin layer of silicone grease may be applied to the insulation surfaces of some  connectors to fill micro-pores in the insulation. Too much grease (more than 5 mil) tends to  prevent complete closure of the connector, introduce air cavities, or deform the pliable  insulation. Therefore, silicone or other additives are not recommended for properly constructed  high-voltage connectors. Commercial HV connectors are available, such as the successful and  widely used product line from Reynolds Industries that implement these principles.                  ome feedthroughs are designed with a shallow well around each termination or pin as shown in  figure 62, Connector Pin With Air Gap (Dunbar, 1988). These wells should be completely filled  with an encapsulant or provided with a generous opening for outgassing to space. The well, if  left open or partially filled with encapsulant, will be subject to partial discharges, even at low  voltages. The voltage across a bubble at the bottom of the well can be found by corona testing  the encapsulated article between each pin and the metal frame. The feedthrough insulator shown  in figure 63, Acceptable Stand-Off Connections (Dunbar, 1988), is an excellent design. It is  designed with corona shields on each end and has no air gaps between the conductor and metal  base plate.               pressurized on the other side. It should be remembered that the small spaces between the  conductor strands are like small air pipes. To be successful, it is required that the wire strands in  that section be filled completely with a potting compound or solder to work. It is best to use  solder with a solder ball or corona shield surface (Dunbar, 1988). The solder balls should be in  the center of the feedthrough. The potting material should be allowed to penetrate the conductor  ends to seal the insulation. Vented connectors should be avoided because they perform poorly  because of slow venting rates, thus resulting in a high probability of partial discharges.   ables for large high-power spacecraft may be required to operate at either high voltage or high  current or both, depending on the type of the power source and the load power requirements. The  design of the power distribution system will require that the line losses be kept to an acceptable  level without jeopardizing the thermal characteristics of the lines or subjecting them to arc-over  events.  istribution system mass is of prime importance to the design of large high-power spacecraft.  The mass of the distribution system includes the lines and interconnections and the required heat  rejection equipment (Finke, et al., 1978). That weight required for distribution wiring for dc or  single-phase ac circuits (in grams) can be calculated by the following equation:                    (or return) line. Since most of the larger spacecraft may be designed using high-resistivity  material such as graphite epoxy, a return line is necessary (return through structure may not be  feasible or desirable). This distribution system mass should be equal to or less than the weight  required for heat rejection. That weight required for heat rejection for the two conductors (in  grams) is given by the following equation:   is distribution line length in cm  A1 and A2 are cross sectional area of the conductor and the insulator, respectively, in cm2  D1 and D2 are the density of conductor and the insulator, respectively, in g/cm3    22  1      is distribution line current in A  \uf072 is line resistivity in \uf057-cm  l is distribution line length in cm  \uf061H is added conduction specific weight of the heat rejection system in (g/W)  A1 is the area per unit length in cm2/cm.  he mass of the heat rejection system depends on the shape and orientation of the conductors,  the operating temperature of the conductors, and the conductor material. Cylindrical conductors  present minimum surfaces for radiative cooling, whereas rectangular conductors present more  surface area for cooling. For simplified analysis, it will be assumed that the conductors will be  constructed from wide, thin, aluminum sheets, with the largest cross-section dimension oriented  toward free space. Aluminum sheet is an excellent material because it is lightweight, low cost,  has good mechanical strength, and can be easily fabricated. Other materials that may be used as  conductors are shown in table 12, Conductor Materials.

Several materials, for example, have lower density than  aluminum while lithium and sodium have much better resistivity-density characteristics. These  materials, along with beryllium and magnesium, are difficult to fabricate and require special  storage. Copper, silver, and silver alloys are heavier than aluminum but are much easier to join  and should be considered for the connector materials. Aluminum materials tend to crack and set  with time. Continual flexing (caused by electrical transients) could cause joints to weaken with  time. Graphite structural characteristics are such that it should not be considered for the ground  return; its resistivity is much higher than most metals.  igh-voltage interconnections between power supplies and electronic circuits are difficult to  design, assemble, and assess, especially if the interconnecting shielded wire is flexed or strained  after it is attached to one or both terminals. Linear stressing can break one or all of the bonded  joints between the shield, conductor, or wire insulation and the terminal and encapsulating  material. Any delamination at the insulation bond will form a void and can result in corona and  eventual voltage breakdown. When the wire is bent at the terminal (figure 63) and the high-  voltage conductor is flexed or stressed, there is a probability of delamination at the wire-  encapsulant surface.  he wire shield and insulation preparation are as important as the connection. One method of  preparing the wire termination is to cut the wire and shield to length and then place three or more  turns of a small conductor or formed metal ring over the end of the wire shield and insulator as  shown in figure 64, Wire Termination. This method holds the shield end strands in place and  forms a round conformal metal surface at the end of the shield. When three or more turns of wire  are used, as for breadboard demonstration, the wire should be soldered in place with a low-heat  iron as to avoid melting or deforming the insulation.              solder. This leaves the electrical post termination protruding through the solder on the circuit  interconnection. Often, the post terminal is clipped after soldering, leaving sharp edges  protruding above the circuit board\u2019s metal surface. This is unacceptable for circuits with voltage  exceeding 250 V-peak. Sketches of acceptable and unacceptable solder joints for high-voltage  circuits are shown in figure 65, Acceptable Solder Terminations, and figure 66, Unacceptable  Solder Terminations. Whenever a solder-draw or sharp edge protrudes from a circuit, the  probability of corona and voltage breakdown is enhanced. First, the conformal coating applied to  the circuit board and circuits may not cover the sharp point or edges. Second, solder has more  free electrons than a conformal coating. It can be assumed that a solder joint has corona initiation  and breakdown voltages of 85 percent that of steel (W.G. Dunbar, unpublished data). Third, any  ionization from a solder joint will result in surface heating of the solder, and the solder will tend  to evaporate a thin layer across the insulation surface between the conductors, resulting in  tracking and arc over. This phenomenon may occur within only a few minutes between high-  voltage conductors.                  smooth surface. Nickel-plated metals or steel are preferred, but other softer metals are often used  because they are easier to fabricate. The radius of curvature on all bends should be at least 2.5  times the conductor (tube) diameter to avoid flattening or crushing the tube at the bend. When  necessary, the ends of the tubes should be flattened as little as possible. The corona suppression  shield should extend over the edges of the flattened end, as shown in figure 67, High-Voltage  Lead and Bushing (Dunbar, 1988). Ample space should be provided between the inside surface  of the insulator (high-voltage bushing in figure 67) and the metal tube. A safe design would be  based on the assumption that the full voltage stress exists on the top edge of the bushing.      ollow tubing should be vented. Vent holes should be drilled through one wall of the tubing at  both ends of the tube. The vent hole should face the corona shield, and no other holes should be  drilled in the tubing.                   igh-voltage flexible lead termination should be designed to eliminate pressure points on the  terminal board (figure 68, High-Voltage Terminals (Dunbar, 1988)). Pressure points may cause  delamination and enhance internal tracking or corona. Also, the terminal should be protected  with a corona ball or shield.    ther insulation techniques include either burnishing or enameling over the knots in ties.  Otherwise, the feathered ends will become points from which corona discharges can emanate  (figure 69, High-Voltage Ties (Dunbar, 1988)).    Corners on Encapsulated Coils (Dunbar, 1988). Rounding the corners eliminates high stress  points or low utilization factors in the media between the encapsulated coil and its support frame.                    ccasionally, a voltage tap is required at the center of the part strings. This tap should be made  of material having the same diameter as the part surface and be thick enough for attachment of a  round tubular connection. Soldered joints should not be used because most soldered electrodes  have lower breakdown potentials than metals such as steel, nickel, brass, copper, and aluminum.  them. A potential shaping surface within a stack of series-connected diodes can be a thin plate of  metal provided with a large-radius edge as shown in figure 71, Curved Edge on High-Voltage  Plate (Dunbar, 1988). This curved edge suppresses corona.       designer may have to interconnect two or more components with a high-voltage flexible wire  that has insulation inadequate to sustain the full electrical stress of the applied voltage. This can  be done only if the following are observed:                     Generally, extra-flexible wire should be used only when the bending and placement of the tubing  through the high-voltage volume is too difficult or will mechanically stress parts during  installation. Terminations on extra-flexible wire will not stay in place as they will with solid  tubing. Therefore, the terminations are to be keyed either to a slot in the insulation barrier or to a  special locking device be developed for the termination and/or wire end.  measurements. These functions are performed with components such as fan motors, relays,  motor-driven switches, instrumentation, sensors, and circuits that operate at voltages less than  250 V-rms or V-dc. These devices and circuits, normally insulated, are incapable of withstanding  the induced transient voltages. Therefore, these circuits and their wiring must be well shielded.   ow-voltage devices and their wiring should be well separated from the high-voltage circuit  wiring. Low-voltage conductor shielding typically has rough surfaces that behave like multiple  points that enhance field gradients with respect to the high voltage. This will result in lowering  the breakdown voltage between high-voltage parts, or conductors, and the low-voltage shields.     sealed on the ends, will slowly depressurize at high altitude and arc from end to end along the  hollow-core surface.  The light blue coatings were well bonded to the elements. The dark blue coatings tended to  debond. The resulting air gaps then depressurized, and the resistors failed.   (MSFC-STD-531). This design is acceptable only if the gas voids are filled or potted with solid  insulations. Voids and gas-filled gaps will cause corona or breakdown and failure. If needed,  resistors should have conformal coating on their entire surface. The terminations will be coated  or encapsulated on the circuit board.                      ielectrics used for high-voltage capacitors include liquids, liquid-impregnated paper or film,  electrolytics, plastic film, paper-plastic combinations, mica, ceramics, glass, compressed gas, and  vacuum. Among these, liquid-impregnated paper or plastic film capacitors offer the best energy-  space-cost combination, unless special requirements with respect to temperature, stability,  radiation resistance, or packaging are involved. Consequently, they are more widely available as  high-voltage capacitors.  quite appropriate for low-voltage, high-performance capacitors used in solid-state  communication equipment are not applicable to high-voltage work and are not covered here.   and yields at acceptable failure rate. The dc capacitors for continuous duty also require a low  dissipation factor because some ac ripple is usually present. High insulation resistance is usually  required for applications. The dc energy storage capacitors require design features that permit  extremely high currents as well as very fast charge and discharge rates.    Series connection of sections necessitates careful attention to conductor insulation, clearances,  geometry, and workmanship, while the necessity for liquid impregnation requires meticulous  control of initial material purity, as well as prevention of contamination during processing.  performance at rated voltage. All papers and films have surface irregularities caused by wrinkles  and stretching that trap air when stacked between metal electrodes. Another advantage of liquid  impregnation is replacing air with higher dielectric strength liquid that results in a more compact  capacitor. Impregnation with solids such as waxes or resins is feasible for some applications.  Unimpregnated plastic film capacitors are also suitable for some applications but are usually  subject to partial discharge damage at ac voltages above 225 V-rms.  n addition to the requirements listed in table 13, Capacitor Requirements, high-voltage  capacitors should be selected that are made from dielectric materials having the highest available  dielectric strength and having the longest demonstrated life at rated stress.

These capacitors are intended for use  in high-temperature applications, similar to those served by hermetically sealed paper capacitors,  but where higher insulation resistance at the upper temperature limits is required.     high-temperature applications that require high insulation resistance, small capacitance change,  and low dielectric absorption. These capacitors exhibit excellent insulation resistance values at  high temperatures.  Dielectrics successfully used in high-voltage capacitors include, but are not limited to, the  materials shown in table 14, Acceptable Impregnates, and the following materials:           radiation resistance, but some interaction was observed between the DAP and K-F polymer  (Ramrus, 1980).

Likewise, qualification and acceptance specifications are usually interpreted and implemented  according to the requirements. In addition, acceptance testing may be limited to the measurement  of capacitance and to the complete characterization of the substrate and developed capacitor.  Substrates should be examined for cracks, delaminations, flaws, and voids using an acoustical  examination such as a Scanning Laser Acoustic Microscope (SLAM) or C-mode Scanning  Acoustic Microscope (C-SAM). This examination reveals manufacturing defects and may result  in an initial rejection rate that is high. Characterization tests for ceramic substrates include  capacitance (C), equivalent series resistance (ESR), equivalent series inductance (ESL),  dissipation factor, DWV, physical dimensions and materials workmanship, vibration, and  accelerated life test. Temperature and voltage ratings should also be considered in design  selection, since capacitance characteristics can degrade with temperature and voltage variations.  eramic capacitors are made in a variety of styles and shapes, but the most commonly used  designs are variants of Multilayer Ceramic Chip (MLCC). Many designs now include metal  layers embedded in the dielectric between anode and cathode and floating electrode construction,  (called floating electrodes) that can offer significant performance advantages. Three examples of  plate arrangement are shown in figure 73, Relative Spacing (Stress) of X7R Dielectric Ceramic  Capacitors (Stinthal, 1982).      the greater the number of plates, the lower the electrical stress between plates. However, very  thin plates may result in more voids and cracks, which degrade the dielectric and lower the  reliability and aging for the capacitors as illustrated in figure 74, Capacitance Versus Applied  Voltage Data for 0.022 \uf06dF, 1000 V, X7R Ceramic Capacitors (Stinthal, 1982) where each data  point is an average of 10 to 12 capacitors.               Figure 74\u2014Capacitance Versus Applied Voltage Data for 0.022 \uf06dF,  1000 V, X7R Ceramic Capacitors           Reconstituted mica is ground mica mixed in a slurry to form very thin sheets of multilayer mica  chips. The resulting thin mica sheet is then bonded to a paper film resulting in a high dielectric  constant, high working voltage material with excellent aging characteristic. The drawback to the  process is the presence of a large quantity of microvoids and cracks in the mica slurry product.  Above the CIV, there will be a large number of partial discharge pulses. These partial discharge  pulses will have small magnitudes in microvoids and larger magnitudes in cracks and debonds.  For high quality capacitors, the partial discharge rate should not exceed 20 pC/s. Partial  discharges should be measured and baselined before and after thermal stress and vibration tests,  and should not increase more than 3 percent above the baseline for the component to be  acceptable.      dielectric thickness, and a large number of voids per square meter. When a paper film is oil or  liquid impregnated, the oil will fill the voids and wrinkles at the beginning of life, passing all the  acceptance criteria. Accelerated life testing usually causes some of the liquid to escape from the  wrinkles and large voids lowering the CIV and CEV and raising the partial discharge rate. As the  capacitors dry and partial discharges accumulate in the voids and wrinkles, the liquid will  polymerize, and hydrogen can replace air and significantly lower the CIV and CEV and increase  the partial discharge number and magnitudes. Tests for film capacitors are the same tests for  mica-paper capacitors.    Sometimes in spacecraft construction, live high-voltage circuits have to be switched on or off  using devices such as hard-vacuum tubes, thyratrons, silicon-controlled rectifiers, and vacuum  switches. The effect of switching on other circuit components such as resistors, capacitors,  wiring, magnetic devices, isolation transformers, electro-optical isolators, and triggering circuits  should be considered. Withstand voltages of such devices are typically rated for continuous  applications; however, the switching or impulse withstand of the devices may differ considerably  from the continuous rating. Boards, terminals, bushings, and other insulation should be impulse  tested.     haracteristics that should be evaluated by test include forward voltage drop (as a function of  current), reverse breakdown voltage, reverse leakage current, and reverse recovery time (t(rr)).  All tests should be done as a function of temperature over the operational range.           Of these parameters, the t(rr), is very important when selecting a diode for high-frequency  applications. A slow recovery time at the higher temperatures may lead to thermal runaway and  rapid aging. The other parameters are self-explanatory and should be judged by comparing  components with the same specified characteristics.   ransformers have several inherent failure modes that may be controlled by proper design,  material selection, and workmanship. Wire fatigue can be eliminated by placing a strain relief  curve at the terminating end of the wire at the anchor tap. In addition, the end of the wire to be  terminated should be stripped without damage by cutting, elongating, or bending the wire. Finally,  soldering the wire to the eyelet or to the termination post should be completed without excessive  solder wicking or using an over-heated soldering iron. The potting or conformal coating material is  to have characteristics compatible with the wire, the metal core, and the termination support  material. For HV transformers in particular, vacuum potting usually produces the best results.  Debonding of the insulation material from the wire, the core, or structure must be avoided as it will  result in either a crack or a void, which may eventually be a source of partial discharges and  accelerated aging.  coupling coefficients as a function of frequency and avoid mutual induced currents as a function  of frequency. Current sharing can be forced by interleafing the primaries and secondaries. This  will reduce hot spots within a winding and promote load sharing between transformer windings.  Since connecting multiple windings in series can result in very high voltages, one should  consider parallel primary windings on opposite legs of the transformer and, likewise, with the  secondary windings.    Curved and Square-Corner PWB Test Structures. Test results between curved and square-  cornered circuits in air and Freon\u00ae and with conformal coating indicate that, with the same  spacing between conductors, the curved circuits in air have 2 to 10 percent higher CIV and  breakdown voltage for spacing less than 30 mil and 15 to 30 percent higher CIV and voltage  breakdown for spacings greater than 60 mil as compared to square cornered ones. Freon\u00ae-  immersed printed circuit boards had an improvement of 5 to 10 times than that of air-insulated  circuits. Conformally coated printed circuit boards had 10 to 40 times higher breakdown voltage  and CIV than air-insulated circuits. However, a consideration that is not to be overlooked is the  workmanship and application of the coating material. Voids or incomplete filling and bonding to  the metal circuits will greatly reduce both CIV and breakdown voltage. Test results and  recommendations are available for a variety of epoxies rated for high voltage applications,  including testing for corona (Hughes/Northrop Grumman, December 1995). Materials and  conductor spacing should be compliant with IPC-2221A standard.                 from a few watts, in the case of smallsats, to several hundred megawatts needed for large  spacecraft using solar electric propulsion. The bonding and grounding of these units will vary  considerably. Smaller spacecraft with powered loads to 5 kW will use standard, single-point  grounding techniques with the solar arrays referenced to the central load module. Larger  spacecraft using multiple solar array sections, capable of being transported to space and  assembled there, may have a main load center and several remote load centers. Those spacecraft  will require special bonding and grounding considerations.      the plasma potential, depending on the plasma density, charged particle flux, and solar  illumination. To equalize the potentials, it is necessary to maintain continuous electrical paths  throughout the structure. Present spacecraft with composite structures already use conducting  coatings to alleviate the spacecraft\u2019s charging problem with reasonable success. The use of a           composite structure will change the nature of the spacecraft ground and complicate grounding  procedures. Concerns such as electrical continuity through the structure will become more  important whenever a composite joint is encountered. However, initial results with composite  spacecraft have indicated that composite joint designs are workable when properly grounded and  bonded. There is still a potential corrosion problem. The design criteria shown in table 15,  Recommendation in Designs Where Graphite/Epoxy is Coupled With Other Materials (Dunbar,  1988), have been suggested for composite/metallic joints in spacecraft (Brantley, 1978).

The metal-filled epoxy joints,  mechanically fastened joints, and metal splices shown in figure 78, figure 79, and figure 80,  respectively, need much improvement or research and development before they can be  considered as applicable for assembly in space. An assessment of these configurations is shown  in table 16, Bonding/Grounding Concept Assessment (Dunbar, 1988).

The static drain path is necessary because the effect of vehicle charging  can be detrimental where the conducting sections of the vehicle are not bonded together. For  example, consider a vehicle that is charged triboelectrically on the forward surfaces and  discharged through corona or the plasma from the skirt at the edges. If the forward section is not  electrically connected to the aft section, charge acquired on the forward section cannot flow to  the aft section unless the potential difference between the sections becomes large enough for a  spark discharge to occur. These spark discharges can be quite energetic, since the capacitance  between the sections may be several thousand picofarads and the sparkover voltage may be  several kilovolts. Furthermore, the spark discharge will seek the easiest electrical path between           the sections. If there is some electrical wiring routed across this gap, it is possible that the spark  will travel through a shorter gap from the section to the wiring, through the wiring, and then  through another short spark gap to the aft section. This, of course, would put a tremendous noise  pulse on any data line. Also, there is the possibility that these spark discharges could fire  pyrotechnic devices.  he creation of high-voltage power supplies or any other high-voltage assembly or device falls  into two stages: the electrical/electronic design and layout/packaging/insulation buildup. The two  stages are intertwined, and both have to be kept in mind throughout the theoretical planning and  the practical hardware fabrication. Several examples of good high-voltage design are presented  in a report by Bever, et al (2006). Operational guidance for test and flight qualification of each  high-voltage power supply is also very important. An example of one such set of instructions is  included with the same report.    2006). High Voltage Power Supply Design Guide for Space. Report No. NASA/TP\u20142006-  214133.

The reasons for not testing high-voltage  electronics for partial discharges are varied. In many cases, industry does not recognize the value  of such testing as a means of demonstrating product reliability. Manufacturing economics often  influence this rationale.  t became evident early in the advent of developing high-voltage equipment for the electric  power utilities that corona and partial discharges shortened the life of the electrical insulation and  equipment. The first signs of such degradation led to the development of corona measuring  instrumentation. Today, it is almost mandatory to measure partial discharges in most electrical  utility power system equipment to identify and reject faulty materials and equipment. Similar                 types of testing should be required for certain space applications as well. This would ensure  normal aging of energized parts and materials without degradation caused by partial discharges.  Many of the practical testing techniques commonly employed are found in Bever et al. (2006)  and in MSFC-STD-531.   designed and calibrated in accordance with various national and international standards  organizations, for example, National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), Institute of  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),  ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials), and SAE  International. While most offer some generic testing and calibration guidelines, the specifics of  equipment connection, calibration, and detection bandwidth selection are often left to the  relevant power apparatus committee or component manufacturer association guidelines to tailor  the testing to the application. Hence, the detection equipment options are typically focused upon  meeting the requirements of specific electrical power apparatus component tests, that is, rotating  machinery, utility high-voltage cable, and transformers and switchgear. As a corollary to this,  much commercial instrumentation is typically designed to test all equipment with energization  voltage at frequencies less than 1 kHz (including dc testing). In the case of electronic equipment  that can operate at frequencies in the 20 kHz to 500 kHz regime, partial discharge test equipment  has to be designed or customized to discriminate between the normal frequencies and the partial  discharge event. Erroneous conclusions can be drawn about the presence or absence of partial  discharges in a component if inappropriate detection equipment is used.  hrough the years, the recording and display of partial discharge data has progressed from a  direct visual display on an oscilloscope to digitization and storage of transient voltage pulses in  computer-based instrumentation. High-speed analog-to-digital converters that can record  multiple traces and aperiodic partial discharge data from dc testing (for later analysis) make this  type of instrumentation invaluable. Without it, dc partial discharge activity is extremely difficult  to quantify. This is particularly important to the testing of many high-voltage aerospace  components, which typically operate at dc potentials. Conversely, testing with ac voltage  generates partial discharge data, which are temporally more predictable and repeatable, than  testing with dc potentials. This is because of the periodic reversing of polarity on the test article,  which repeatedly charges and discharges the dielectric. Here, digital conversion and storage  instrumentation is also useful for accurate partial discharge activity characterization, but visual  display methods may be adequate.  t is the purpose of this section to point out some of the difficulties associated with utilizing  partial discharge test equipment designed for utility power apparatus applications to evaluate  aerospace electronic systems. This is not to say that such equipment is entirely unsuitable but  rather to make known the need for careful application and/or possible modification before to its  use in testing aerospace electronic equipment. Some problem areas fall into the following  categories:                    voltage surges that can apply higher voltages on turn-to-turn insulation in random-wound motors  and actuators.       less than 30 kHz. This is to eliminate electromagnetic noise generated in power system  equipment. Unfortunately, this can include the partial discharge bandwidth associated with low-  pressure discharges, that is, from about 0.001 to 2 Torr. In addition, the upper cut-off frequency  for certain wideband detection systems is often limited to a few megahertz. Many aerospace  high-frequency power conversion electronics may include switching circuitry that generates  considerable EMI in that frequency spectrum. Thus, partial discharge detection equipment  designed for commercial utility applications may require substantial modification of the  detection circuitry for aerospace equipment evaluations. As a minimum, equipment with  selectable or tunable detection bandwidth is required.    to the discharge source circuitry or placed near enough to it to electromagnetically couple the  discharge activity into the detection system. That is, the sensor should be placed in a position to  detect but not to perturb the electric fields and/or the operating characteristics of the test article.  In addition, an electromagnetically coupled sensor should be designed with sufficient sensitivity  so it can be located a convenient distance from the high-voltage conductors and parts in the test  circuit, such that shorting or arcing will not occur between the sensor and circuit parts.   the ground electrode. Instrumentation can be designed to sense the minute perturbations  generated by the passing of the discharge pulse current through the resistor. The transient voltage  signal is then passed through a transducer or isolation amplifier and displayed or recorded. This  circuit can be also used to evaluate the pd activity in electronic systems, which operate at high  frequency and/or high altitude.  n some instances, a resistor already exists between the circuit ground and system ground. A  specific criterion for the use of an existing resistor is that it be in series with the ground circuit              and that it not be bypassed by a filter. Some circuits utilize filter or shunt capacitors to reduce  EMI susceptibility.   electrical device used for measuring ac or high-speed current pulses (Wikipedia article,  \u201cRogowski Coil,\u201d 2013). These devices can be placed around a conductor in the test circuit, and  the output of the coil can be easily recorded and stored. The sensitivity of the Rogowski coil  (typically in volts/amp) must be selected for specific test purposes. The advantage of the  Rogowski coil is that it allows sampling of many different locations in a test circuit without  adding extra line resistance which, in many cases, will alter test results. The disadvantage of the  Rogowski coil is that it will not measure dc currents and it may not have enough sensitivity to  detect small partial discharge pulses. Within these limitations, the coils can work well in this  application.   The environment most likely to produce partial discharge activity ranges in vacuum pressure  from 10 Torr to 1 mTorr and there are many pressure sensor types that can be used to measure  the pressure in this range. However most of the sensors require insight into the response of the  pressure sensor in the current working gas, such as air. Many times this response limits the  ability to accurately measure the pressure at the lower and upper ends of the pressure range  which is the exact range where the tests must be carried out.   capacitance manometer is a pressure gauge that has been widely used to accurately measure  vacuum in the range of interest, independent of the working gas. The capacitance manometer has  been used in many tests and has proven to be a highly reliable instrument.   n UHF systems, gaseous breakdowns or glow discharges can develop and are sometimes  referred to as multipactor (see section 6.3.5). Such voltage breakdown (or multipactor) generally  only occurs at pressures less than 0.5 Pa (~4mTorr). UHF systems and components are usually  tested for voltage breakdown and for multipactor by input/output measurements or by VSWR  measurements. The presence of multipactor or voltage breakdown is measured as a change in  transmitted or reflected power (Chown, et al., 1970).  components and aerospace systems after installation has been completed. The presence of a  voltage breakdown or multipactor within a cavity or waveguide produces a very slight vibration  or audible noise. One technique is accomplished by attaching a very small accelerometer, strain  gauge, or other vibration sensor to the component\u2019s exterior. The vibrations generated by the  internal multipactor or voltage breakdown may be sensed. If a precise location of the breakdown  or multipactor is required, multiple vibration sensors may be used in a triangulation scheme. The                   other technique uses an external sonic detector to recognize noise generation in proximity to the  component. Of course, spatial resolution of the noise source is difficult.  ptical detectors have sensitivities compatible with the quantity of photons produced by the  discharges. Some of these detectors must be operated with little or no background illumination.  Most optical detectors are large, and may require fiber optic leads for direct optical viewing. This  implies that the detection of corona or glow discharges may be limited to the outer surface of the  test article. If the emission component of the discharge energy in the visible spectrum is large  enough, unaided visual corona detection is possible and certainly cost effective.   the UHF frequency band, can initiate very faint glows. A low-light-level camera or image  intensifier may be used to detect glow discharges, provided the test article can be tested in a  suitable darkened environment. One such application was on the SPEAR (He and Hall, 1984)  vehicle. In this example, the camera signals (pulsed discharge events) were passed through a  transducer, amplified, and transferred to the data bus system for transmission to Earth. This  technology may be very helpful when testing spacecraft high-voltage systems in enclosed  vacuum chambers.  till cameras can be used, assuming the still camera synchronization between the transient  discharge event and shutter speed is achieved or conditions are conducive to time exposure  techniques. This is less of an issue when the discharge is of long duration or a continual glow.  nother example of an optical device used to detect partial discharge in a vacuum chamber is an  infrared video system. The detection device uses specially developed cameras that sense only in  the infrared spectrum, that is, 2.5 microns to 25 microns. This optical device, when combined  with high-speed data acquisition, allows the digital monitoring of these test configurations many  times faster than a standard video system. The advantage of the infrared video camera is that it  allows the viewing of a pd in almost complete darkness. The infrared video camera has been  used successfully for monitoring and identifying the location of partial discharge events in many  tests.   photomultipliers, and curved plate analyzers, have inherent partial discharge detection capability.  The electronic circuitry associated with these instruments is much more sensitive than most  partial discharge instrumentation and can detect charge transfer quantities of less than 1 pC.  Therefore, any extraneous transient signals generated by partial discharge within their power  supplies or high-voltage electronic circuitry can be detected and displayed by the above  instruments when operated at full potential. The signals will appear either as dots and dashes on  visual displays or as spurious data in the signal record (Anderson and Kresge, 1957).                    simple and readily available electromagnetic-based device can be used for partial discharge  detection when only very qualitative information is needed. A small hand-held radio tuned to the  low end of the AM frequency spectrum (510 to 540 kHz) is one of the easiest tools to use to  detect significant, continuous partial discharge activity. The radio will pick up transmitted  signals from partial discharges as long as the radio antenna can be placed in close proximity and  oriented toward the partial discharge signal source(s) within the test article. The partial discharge  activity can be heard as a crackling or popping. This is possible since corona and partial  discharges radiate a very wide frequency spectrum, as shown in figure 20. However, the exact  location of the partial discharges cannot be determined by this method; only a general area in the  vicinity of the partial discharge site is discernable. (Note: This detection technique is usually  only applicable for equipment operated at pressures greater than 30 Torr.)    surface of a test article change temporally. It has been observed that the frequency spectrum of  such discharges in low-pressure air (0.1 to 2 Torr) is predominantly in the range of 10 to 30 kHz  (Woo, 1968a; Nanevicz and Hilbers, 1973; Densley, 1970; and Mason, 1978). Figure 21 shows a  specific case with parallel, #16 AWG, solid copper wire electrodes spaced 4.8 cm. in air at 0.75  Torr. This limited low-frequency spectrum is undetectable by the hand-held radio method and  some commercial partial discharge test equipment. A partial discharge test system with tunable  detection bandwidth can detect the glow discharge frequency spectrum. Input high-pass filters  may have to be modified or removed to detect the partial discharge frequency range at low  pressure.   detect the RF signals radiated from partial discharge generated within an electronic circuit or  system. When specialized antennas or probes are used, the test operator will be required to  position and orient the sensing device with respect to the partial discharge source to achieve  maximum coupling between the sensor antenna and the generated partial discharge activity.  However, the test operator should be aware that the partial discharge activity may be  superimposed on the circuit or system operating frequencies. In some cases, the test operator  may find it necessary to develop special filter circuits to attenuate normal operating frequencies  and harmonics so as not to affect the collection of partial discharge information. The available  partial discharge spectrum can then be optimized, amplified, displayed, and/or recorded for  future evaluation and analysis.   turns of insulated #22 AWG solid copper wire wound as an approximately 2-cm diameter  multiturn coil makes a simple RF pickup that can be maneuvered over the surface of an  electronic circuit. The coil output leads are then impedance matched to a transmission line and  connected to the detection amplifier. By attaching the coil to an insulating rod in the manner of a  wand, the operator can use the directional characteristic of the probe to locate the source of  partial discharge sites on an open assembly. The advantage of such a probe is that it can be  oriented in any direction and moved over the surface of the test article. This type probe has been           successfully used to determine the presence of partial discharges when assessing developmental  circuits and hardware.   limitation, which is its lack of absolute calibration. First, the distance between the partial  discharge activity and sensor detector is not fixed. Second, it is often difficult to introduce a  known calibrating signal into the electronic test article. Finally, the orientation of the probe with  respect to the plane of the partial discharge sources is unknown. Therefore, the antenna detection  system should be considered primarily qualitative.  hen it is necessary to quantify partial discharge activity, a capacitor-type sensor can be  developed (Bartnikas, 1979; and Ahmed et al., 1979). A capacitive sensor can be constructed  from a parallel plate capacitor geometry. The positive signal plate is positioned close to the test  article partial discharge source. To obtain a relative calibration, it will be necessary to inject a  calibration signal into the electronic circuitry under test.  t is intuitive that the synergism of different simultaneous detection methods may result in better  partial discharge detection with increased resolution. This has been used on high-frequency and  pulsed power components and subsystems. The following is an example describing the  simultaneous use of two different detection techniques. In this case, an improvised RF probe was  used while the circuitry was totally encapsulated in a dielectric media. The RF probe was placed  over the suspect circuit. When the RF probe could not be used, because the circuitry was in very  close proximity to a shield or ground plane, a very thin, small area (~2 cm2) capacitor was  utilized. The custom-developed capacitor was constructed from two conducting plates separated  by a thin film dielectric (with the outer plate grounded). The partial discharge signal was  transferred from the inner plate to the processing circuitry via a small diameter coaxial cable.  t is obvious that in some electronic circuits or systems the inherent background noise or EMI  may have a frequency bandwidth that includes the majority of the partial discharge frequency  spectrum. Thus, the use of band-pass or high-frequency cut-off filters to measure the partial  discharge activity selectively becomes impractical. Another effective technique may be to use a  spectrum analyzer to detect the presence of partial discharge activity within a circuit containing  EMI and natural operating frequency spectra. For this detection technique to be effective, it may  be necessary to operate the high-voltage electrical/electronic circuit at less than the rated voltage  to establish a spectral baseline. Typically, the baseline data should be taken at approximately half  of the rated voltage to be assured that the frequency spectrum displayed by the spectrum analyzer  is free of contribution from partial discharge activity. By increasing the voltage slowly to 75  percent, 100 percent, and finally to 115 percent or 125 percent operating voltage, individual  partial discharge spectral signatures can be observed and recorded. By comparing the output  frequency spectrum displays, the discharge inception voltage may be determined and/or the  partial discharge activity level can be characterized.              equipment testing and lab investigations (Meek and Craggs, 1978; Gill and von Engle, 1948; and  August and Chown, 1970). They are best suited for totally enclosed circuitry, which does not  lend itself to other detection schemes, by placing acoustic device(s) on the available component  surface. For example, electronic power conversion equipment that is totally encapsulated inside a  nonremovable shield box may be evaluated for partial discharges using acoustic emission  detectors (Boggs and Stone, 1982). Acoustic devices may be selected with resonant frequencies  from 50 kHz to 1 MHz. In the selection of these types of devices, one should consider the  specific electrical noise and operating frequency characteristics of the test article and avoid these  frequency ranges. The output of an acoustic detector is typically fed through an appropriate  preamp and filter into an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, or dedicated data acquisition system.     2006).

The phases iterate based on the needs of the design.        evelopment planning is essential for early identification of all the development needs and risks.  It also provides the PLD design team with a clear view of the near- and long-term objectives and  goals. The planning and requirements phase (PRP) occurs when requirements have been  allocated to the board where the PLD resides. High-level system requirements flow down and  the design team uses them to generate the PLD requirements.  he planning phase includes documenting a development plan that all developers follow. The  plan documents the systematic approach used to manage, design, develop, verify, document, and  review all PLDs delivered. The design team can customize the level of detail to the complexity  of the design and project. Appendix C provides more details on customization.                                During the preliminary design phase (PDP), the design team generates a top-level design based  on the device requirements. This top-level design includes block diagrams and data flow  diagrams that serve as the design architecture. Design trade studies are completed during this  phase. This phase is complete when the stakeholders identified in the PRP approve the  preliminary design. Section 6 describes this phase in greater detail.   DDP, the preliminary design is used to generate a more detailed design based on the  requirements and architecture. This phase iterates as needed with the design implementation  phase to further modify and/or expand until it meets all requirements. This phase is complete  when the stakeholders identified in the PRP approve the documented detailed design. Section 7  describes this phase in greater detail.   uring the design implementation phase, design capture (such as coding in a hardware  description language (HDL)) is completed. The design team performs design simulation,  synthesis, place and route (PnR), and timing analyses. The design may be tested on a  development board and/or hardware resembling the final flight system. This phase iterates with  the DDP as needed. Section 8 describes this phase in greater detail.   Verification determines that the end product meets all of the specified requirements whereas  validation determines the requirements are correct. Validation is beyond the scope of this  document since it often requires a higher level of integration. Verification activities include  reviews, tests, and simulations in accordance with the plan developed in the PRP. Formal  acceptance of the final design occurs at the conclusion of the verification phase (VP). Section 9  describes this phase in greater detail.   After successful verification, the design team releases the completed design for integration into  the next higher-level assembly (e.g., board, box, etc.). Section 10 describes this phase in greater  detail.   The development team continues to provide troubleshooting support for issues deemed  unsolvable by the user of the design, and investigates and tracks potential design anomalies to  completion. Maintenance support covers any issues reported after the delivery. Section 11  describes this phase in greater detail.              Numerous projects do project planning as part of the system planning. All items that are  identified in the PRP can be done separately or as part of the larger planning.     a. A development plan.  b. A requirements document.  c. A verification plan.   Project Management, System Engineering, and the Chief Engineer. The use of NPR7123.1,  NASA Systems Engineering and Process Requirements, continues to serve as the governing  requirements for system development.  The design team applies customization to each of the documents depending on the project.  Appendix C shows a proposed PLD classification to aid in determining an appropriate  customization.    The scope of work for each role on the development team varies with the size and complexity of  the development. A development team member may perform multiple roles for a simple  development. Conversely, multiple individuals might be required to share the responsibilities for  a single role for a large development. Work with the line management to set the initial roles and  responsibilities for the development effort. This can then be worked into the efforts defined by  the project.   1) Co-develop the development plan with the technical development lead.  (2) Manage the development plan.  (3) Manage budget and schedule.  (4) Collect development metrics and provide status to project management.  (5) Manage procurement contracts.  b.

The test lead is the source of the testability requirements  (software, test points, fault injection, etc.).  3) Test Equipment Development Lead: Responsible for developing and negotiating the  functional requirements for the test equipment with the technical development lead.  (4) Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) personnel: Serves as an independent assessor.  NASA-HDBK-8739.23, NASA Complex Electronics Handbook for Assurance  Professional, documents the SMA roles and responsibilities, and they are NOT duplicated  in this document. In addition for safety-critical projects, SMA personnel will also use  NPR 8715.3C, General Safety Program Requirements, for applicability to PLDs.    1) Board Design Lead: Owner of the board where the PLD resides. The board design  lead works with the technical development lead on defining the PLD requirements,  ensures compatible interface between the board and PLD throughout the design  phases, and coordinates the overall verification effort for the board.

C. System engineers.  D. Test engineers.                 A possible role-based organization chart of the development team is shown in figure 2, Example  Development Team Role-Based Organization Chart, follows.   In addition to the development team, the corresponding delivery organization also plays an  integral role in the development process. It is the delivery organization\u2019s responsibility to:     The PLD design process includes documenting a development plan(s) for the developers to  follow. This plan(s) documents the systematic approach used to manage, design, verify,  document, and review all PLDs delivered. Development planning involves defining several  items that have long-term implications on the project. These can include the following:     a. Development tools.  b. Metrics measurement.  c. Risk management.  d. System safety considerations  e. Configuration management.  f. Training.  APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\u2014DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED                   The design team can customize the development plan depending on the complexity and project  requirements. All items listed above do not necessarily require a separate detailed plan. The  team notes each item, the related activities, and issues that affect the cost and schedule. Many  times these plans can be a part of an overall project development plan.      (1) Manufacturer.  (2) Tool.  (3) Version.  (4) Function.  (5) Repository for tool archival.   without sufficient justification (e.g., re-characterization of the targeted device and/or a bug fix  that would affect the functionality of the programmed PLD). When an issue warrants a tool  update, revise the development plan and notify the development team.   (GIDEPs) or manufacturer notices, will be communicated to the design team. This could come  from other discipline areas, such as assurance or parts engineering. This is also applicable to the  PLD itself, not only the programming tool.    g. Schedule.  h. Bug tracking.  i. Project deliverables.  j. Review planning.  k. Roles and Responsibilities.                dvances in today\u2019s technology have allowed PLD capacity to become increasingly dense.  Therefore, PLD designs have also become proportionally more complex. There is a need for  projects and programs to be able to measure the progression of the PLD design toward the final  end product. Metrics measurement allows project management to track PLD design through  design, implementation, verification, and integration.    a. To provide visibility into the design progress.  b. To complete the development per the agreed-upon schedule and budget.  c. To identify programmatic risks.  d. Monitor accepted and rejected design change requests.  The PLD team lead would be responsible for collecting project metrics, storing them in the  project folder, analyzing the measurement data and reporting them periodically. The report may  also contain a summary statement of the metrics pointing out any measurements trending  towards a limit that may indicate a pending problem. Project metrics for each PLD can include:  a. Coverage metrics (code and functional).  b. Design effort (man-hours) \u2013 planned versus actual.  c. Budget \u2013 planned versus actual.  d. Requirements stability \u2013 number of requirements, number of requirements changes,   PLD inputs/outputs (I/Os), static random access memory (SRAM) memory, timing, etc.) \u2013  actual.   . Requirements verification progress (procedures or test benches developed and verified).  g. Number of problem reports and review item discrepancies \u2013 open, closed, and   h. Number of reviews \u2013 planned versus actual.  i. Risks and mitigations.            epending on the size and project requirements of the PLD development, the development team  will want to identify and manage risks. The technical development lead identifies and manages  the risks. Pay special attention to areas such as the following:   afety-critical applications impose requirements on a project\u2019s system safety team to develop  key documents, including a safety data package and a hazard report. For such safety-critical  PLD designs, the PLD team could be tasked with supporting the safety team to provide  information that they can use to document hazards and their mitigation. Hazard identification  could cover safety elements:    a. Device resource utilization.  b. Timing.  c. Power consumption.  d. External interfaces.      NASA requires Safety and Mission Assurance (SMA) to validate the verification of safety  requirements. This can include the witnessing of tests. This validation typically happens at  levels higher than the PLD, such as at box or subsystem level. For those cases where validation  is applied down at the PLD level, PLD verification planning needs to accommodate key  participants such as SMA.   he project or Center defines formal CM for control of released items. At lower levels, the PLD  team or line organization typically establishes a revision control system to manage the changes to  and archiving of working documents and design files. A controlled item is anything submitted to  the revision control or CM system. A typical system needs to incorporate capabilities including  the following:                  b. Method(s) for identifying/marking a controlled item.  c. The process for modifying a controlled item.  d. The process established for user access and privileges.  e. Institutional IT Security measures necessary to secure controlled items for  he PLD team follows established processes for revision control. If none exist, then they work  with their line organization to establish revision control. The PLD team, in conjunction with the  project, if necessary, determines the minimum document and design file types to be  controlled. A set of revision controlled items typically includes the following:   a. Design environment (e.g. *.ADB file for MicroSemi devices).  b. Design and test files.  c. Deliverables.  At a minimum, any time the design team programs the design into a physical device, it also puts  the controlled items into the revision control system. It is best practice to keep all files used in  design, simulation and hardware testing under revision control. This is especially useful in  diagnosing problems where the design needs to revert to a prior test configuration.   he revision control goal for the design environment is to ensure that the design environment is  documented, controlled, and reproducible. These revision control items include the following:  . Setup, project files and any other file that can dictate the behavior of the design tool.  c. Script files and makefiles.  a. Design tools such as those used for simulation, synthesis, PnR, and PLD  programming. If the design is not text- or HDL-based, such as Matlab or schematic, keep the  design entry tool under revision control.     a. Design documents (design specifications, the verification plan, test procedures, etc.).  b. Files needed for producing the design.  c. Internal or external IP that is used for the design.  d. Simulation test benches and environment.  APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE\u2014DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED                  e. Models used in simulation.  f. Test software and test scripts used during PLD hardware testing.  g. Information obtained from reviews (e.g., peer reviews, action items, defects found, etc.).  h. All results from verification efforts including test results. Any known or open issues   i. All programming files (fuse files, bit files, etc.).  j. Bug reports.  It is a best practice to adopt one of the common software revision control tools (e.g., Concurrent  Versions System (CVS) or Subversion (SVN)) to manage the files. In addition to keeping the  test software and scripts under revision control, the design team records the script, software, and  hardware version information in the test log and archives it along with the test artifacts. The  design team reconstructs the test environment when troubleshooting a problem using these items.  he development plan also defines how the delivered design is uniquely identified within the  version control system. This includes the identifying files used for programming the design, the  programmed device, and information about when to use the programmed device in a higher  assembly. Section 10 contains a list of delivery items.       a. Digital design (basic design, I/O standard, I/O thresholds, etc.).  b. Design capture (VHDL, Verilog, etc.).  c. Design analysis (worst-case analysis, signal integrity analysis, etc.).  d. Radiation effects.  e. Design tools (synthesis, PnR, etc.).  f. Verification (simulation techniques, test techniques, etc.).  g. CM tools or revision control tools.                  The PLD team lead creates and maintains the schedule for the PLD life cycle, which includes,  but is not limited to:           . Upon approval, the schedule is baselined with an initial cost estimate.  g. Deliverables.  h. Training.  i. Monitor progress against schedule periodically.  j.  k. Revise schedule as problems are discovered or new requirements added.   ugs are errors in the design or implementation. \u201cBug tracking\u201d tools simplify the process of  capturing and tracking bugs and the exact logic and test case versions required to recreate them.  This tool is useful for tracking project-level metrics related to defects found versus defects fixed.  It is a best practice for the PLD development team to have a tool for tracking bugs, issues, or  potential design changes. Bug tracking information can include:   a. A description of the error, issue, and/or potential design change.  b. The PLD version.  c. The severity of the error, issue and/or potential design change.  d. The status of the error or issue (open, resolved, in progress, use as is).  e. The test configuration.  f. The individual assigned to resolve the error or issue, or to implement the design change.  g. The required completion date/release date.             A best practice for bug tracking is to select a tool that is searchable, sortable, and provides  statistics for a number of open, resolved items. For larger projects, this simplifies the gathering  of metrics and the sorting of large quantities of issues.   identifies the expected deliverable(s) for this unique development. If there are intermediate  developmental deliveries, they are identified and documented in the development plan.   appropriate stakeholders that can participate for each review. For purposes of this document, a  broad range of possible reviews and participants is provided. The reviews will be customized  per the complexity of the design.   The reviews ensure that the design meets all of its requirements for its intended application early  in the development process to prevent costly debug and rework. Benefits of reviews include the  following:  a. The identification of issues.  b. The clarification of requirements.  c. The sharing of knowledge (technical knowledge, lessons learned, etc.).  d. The generation and satisfaction of exit criteria prior to proceeding to the next phase.  Reviews listed in table 1, List of Possible Reviews, are internal to the PLD development team  and separate from the project milestone reviews. Depending on the project, the schedule of the  reviews may be planned to coincide with project-level reviews. The reviews and list of involved  participants can be customized based upon the complexity of the design.

Appendix B contains sample checklists.                       equirements are allocated to each electronic assembly and flowed down to the board and  ultimately the PLD. PLD requirements are negotiated between the board design lead and the  technical development lead. The requirements development process iterates as needed. Analyze  and review allocated requirements during each iteration. Any issues and questions that are found  are discussed and resolved. As a result of this review and discussion, the allocated requirements  are refined, clarified, and new requirements derived as needed. For complex PLD designs with  many requirements, tracking such requirements can be aided by using a formal requirements  database tool such as the Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (DOORS).     The technical development lead generates a PLD requirements document, to capture all the  requirements that flowed down. The technical development lead also provides requirements  traceability and derived requirements. Once baselined, this document provides traceability for  the implementation, and establishes the guidelines for the test and verification steps. Most PLD  requirements flow down from the board-level requirements, and can include:           For safety-critical requirements, a unique identification can be used. The identification will be  used by SMA to identify the appropriate level of verification for the requirements that are safety  critical.                 tracing, such as change impact analysis, verifies that requirements are implemented, and assesses  the impact of a system-level requirement change. Bottom-up tracing, such as defect impact  analysis, ensures that only required features are present and assesses the impact on the higher  level system of any defect found at a low level.      a. Analyze the requirements change to determine schedule and cost impacts.  b. In the event of a conflict, assemble the appropriate people to work the issue until   c. Analyze the requirements change for technical impact.  d. Analyze the requirements change for risk impact, including safety.   redundancy, interlocks, upset rates, etc. Appendix E contains additional design considerations.  For safety-critical designs, use design criteria 5 found in table 5, PLD Classification, of  Appendix C.     he verification lead generates the verification plan for verification activities, which includes  methods, environments, and criteria. The verification plan documents the plan to verify that the  design meets all requirements, is subject to the review of the project team, and includes details  regarding how the verification team will record, address, and track to closure the results of  verification activities. Verification occurs to the lowest level possible. PLD design verification  typically comprises simulations and testing in a hardware environment. Under the formal list of  verification methods, simulation falls under analysis.  ndependent verification is recommended for larger and more complex projects or safety-critical  applications, because it supports a more objective interpretation of the requirements. The  advantage here is a more complete assessment of the design.                   (1) Inspection.  (2) Analysis (e.g., simulation, etc.).  (3) Demonstration.  (4) Test (preferred verification method).   including test bench descriptions; identification of additional verification, such as  negative testing or simulations).     (1) Test identifier.

(9) Identification of test configuration.  he use of IP cores (acquired, inherited, reused) does not eliminate the need to verify the core.  See section 6.3 for more information on the use of IP. Considerations for the verification of IP  cores include:   application notes, revision notes, test benches, addendums or errata notices for core  modifications, updates, license agreement, and any vendor documentation describing the extent  of vendor verification of their IP cores.                     maximize coverage of functional or operational scenarios and configuration (e.g., \u201ctest as you  fly,\u201d \u201cfly as you test\u201d).   design. In other words, verify that the IP core can be synthesized to incorporate any necessary  radiation-mitigation strategies, such as triple mode redundancy (TMR) or, for the case of a hard  core, comes implemented with appropriate radiation-mitigation strategies.    it is possible to verify some tools, it is costly. A more effective method to mitigate the risk is  through extensive PLD verification using accepted industry-standard tools. It is a best practice  for the designer to read all errata that came with the tools and be part of the user community so  that errors/workarounds can be mitigated/used early.   all the requirements. The matrix shows how the requirements are described/designed in the  design specification and where in the verification plan the requirements are tested. Finally, it  traces the requirements into the verification documentation (test procedure, test bench, analysis  report, etc.) that identifies how the requirement is verified. Table 2, Sample Verification Matrix,  below shows an example.         Method  (I,A,D,T)  T   Test Procedure/  Test Bench/  Analysis Report  TPR-123    Verification  Plan            of the design. For small projects, the design team may combine the preliminary design in the  DDP. For these projects, the system-level design, the subsystem design, and the assembly design  may incorporate the preliminary design.    he PDP is the design phase that begins the design cycle. The top-level design is generated in  the PDP. With the design of the top level, the items from the planning phase can be updated and  changes identified. The PDP can be entered when the following criteria are met:    a. Development plan is baselined.  b. PLD requirements are written, but may not be baselined.  This list does not include all elements of the planning phase. It allows for work to proceed while  additional planning is in progress.      a. A board-level block diagram depicting PLD internal and external interfaces.  b. A top-level block diagram of the PLD architecture.  c. Data flow diagram(s).  d. Selected PLDs part type(s) with preliminary utilization estimates.  e. A clock distribution description with frequency information.  f. A reset distribution description.  g. Radiation effects mitigations (e.g., scrubbing, TMR, etc.).  h. Board-level considerations (e.g., signal integrity, power integrity, power consumption, etc.).  i. A description of all hardware and software interfaces.  j. Re-configurability requirements (if applicable).  If the PLD interfaces to elements outside the board then the design team includes a system-level  block diagram.                 he interface definition, defines the interface between multiple interfaces (e.g., multiple pieces  of hardware, hardware and software, avionics and software, etc.). This document need not be  unique to the PLD. It can be part of a larger document.    The preliminary version of the interface specification is prepared, reviewed, and baselined. The  interface specification can include the following items:  a. The register interface.  b. Bit definitions of registers.  c. All interface signals.  d. Memory map.  e. Protocols (e.g., RS-422, PCI, 1553, etc.).  f. Pinout.  ach development organization documents the approach to meeting certification requirements  for any computing system\u2019s hardware elements that include any off-the-shelf (OTS) components  (e.g., a previously designed \u201cheritage\u201d circuit board assembly, an application-specific integrated  circuit (ASIC) used in another design, IP procured or obtained from another source.)  ach developer of PLDs that include non-development items (i.e., design elements that are  reused from another application or that are procured or obtained from a source outside their  developmental control, such as IP) ensures that the inclusion of such non-development items  meets all the requirements of the PLD design in its intended application. This assessment  extends to the overall circuit design as well.  hen purchasing IP, the licensing agreements are reviewed to make sure they extend through  the life of the project. This includes the maintenance phase. Additionally, purchased IP may not  include the source code or the detailed core design, possibly making testing of the core very  difficult. When the source code is not available, the project has to analyze the risk of using that  core. The core will have to be verified without the ability to review the source code completely.  There may also be limited access to testing the core. The project team weighs the risk versus the  benefits of that core.    When purchasing IP, allow your Center\u2019s legal team to review the licensing agreement.  Licensing agreement negotiations can be lengthy, impacting the schedule. Also, ensure that the  agreement extends through the life of the project, including the maintenance phase.               The PDP is the first phase of the design cycle. The PDP is complete when the following criteria  have been met:  a. The preliminary design is complete.  b. A preliminary version of the design specification is baselined.  c. The interface definition(s) are baselined.  d. A list of proposed IP (heritage and new) that will be used in the design is identified.  e. Reviews are completed as defined in the development plan.  f. The planning phase documents (see section 5) are baselined, including:  (1) Requirements.  (2) Development plan.  (3) Verification plan.  he DDP is entered upon completion of the PDP. The DDP generates the design specification,  but not the design files used to implement the PLD. Detailed design information, such as timing  diagrams, detailed block diagrams, is developed during this design phase. The information  developed in this phase is used for capturing the design during the design implementation phase.       a. The preliminary design specification is baselined.  b. The interface definition is baselined.  c. The PDP and associated reviews are successfully completed.  d. The planning phase documents (see section 5) are baselined, including :  (1) Requirements.  (2) Development plan.  (3) Verification plan.                   t is recommended that the PLD team utilize a common HDL coding style. Design organizations  may consider the use of common coding standards across multiple projects, in order to facilitate  effective reviews and design insight.     a. Standard coding style.  b. Documentation that is consistent with the design.  c. Current, regularly updated documents.  d. Use of appropriate comments for the design.  e. Use of configuration control for the design.   a. Use of naming conventions to allow recognition of the function of signals by their name.  b. Use of the header of the HDL design to capture nomenclature (see Appendix A).  c. Use of modular design to ease testability, readability, and simulation.  d. Use of editor tools (tool editor software, Ultra-Edit, use of spaces versus tabs, etc.).  e. Use of self-checking/documenting test-benches.  f. Use of proper code documentation, particularly inline documentation, which later   g. Documentation of each procedure or function.  h. Use of inline comments to explain thoroughly the applicability of assumptions and                        t is recommended as a best design practice to use synchronous design methods. The behavior of  a synchronous design is predictable/deterministic and more tolerant to race conditions, hazards  (dynamic or static), or glitches introduced by environmental conditions. Fully synchronous  designs can also be more easily migrated or reused across PLD device types. The use of non-  synchronous design methods is rarely appropriate, and their use has to be sufficiently justified,  because they usually require more effort to validate or verify in the design.    a. Transition all signals on the clock edge.  b. Avoid using a gated clock (a clock that is driven from logic, not a clock buffer).  c. Handle carefully signals that cross clock domains. There are many techniques, such  as double registers; metastable resistant registers; first in, first outs (FIFOs); etc. The design  identifies the best method for the particular implementation.  d. Synchronize asynchronous inputs to system clock in one location.  e. Minimize the number of clock domains.  f. Utilize synchronously de-asserted rests.   buffers on clock and reset nets. Use of low-skew clock buffers simplifies timing analysis and  avoids race conditions (e.g., hold-time violations) by enabling more simultaneous (synchronized)  clock arrival times. This ensures more deterministic functional behavior. Therefore, when  sequentially adjacent registers are clocked on a common edge, use low-skew clock resources. It  is acceptable to design with routed clocks, and this can often result in a reduction of power  consumption or an effective increase in the number of clocks available. However, precise skew-  tolerant design techniques and analysis have to be used. In addition, routing clock signals over  long distances inside the PLD to the inputs of clock buffers using regular routing resources may  make the signals vulnerable to crosstalk from nearby signals, possibly resulting in errant  behavior. To avoid this, ensure that PLD clock input pin or logic that generates the clock is close  to clock buffer input.   any analysis tools are useful for analyzing logic within a single chip, but few are effective at  analyzing system or chip-to-chip timing. In addition, while the worst-case behavior of the clock-  to-out of the source chip is easily analyzed using \u201cminimum\u201d or \u201cbest case\u201d timing parameters,  the hold time of the destination chip may need to be analyzed assuming a slow path for the clock  and a fast path for the data for the same calculation. A strategy to consider would be to assign or  allocate delays to each signal leaving one device and being received at the next. These            allocations can be used as constraints for synthesis and timing analysis to ensure that the system  will meet timing once integrated.  In general, rigorous analysis of the chip-to-chip interface delays and clock skew is performed to  validate the destination capture scheme. Analysis considerations include the following:  a.

This can result in a change of programming of the DLL or PLL, which is  sometimes subtle, or a change in mode.    (2) An SEU or single event transient (SET) can cause the DLL or PLL to unlock or  glitch and, consequently, make the entire circuit that is within the clock tree  unstable or inoperable, necessitating a reset.  . Account of DLL/PLL clock jitter and stability.  e. Power supply and decoupling strategies on the circuit board for the DLL/PLL circuit.                 Use of internal DLL/PLL PLD circuitry has to include careful analysis of a project\u2019s radiation  requirements and available radiation test data on the PLD\u2019s DLL/PLL circuitry, which is  typically softer than the other elements within the PLD.  PGA designs with multiple clock domains are now common. Perform clock domain crossing  (CDC) analysis. Based on analysis of the clock trees, identify all signals crossing clock domains  and determine the need for metastable state resolution. When de-metastability logic is used, it  needs to be evaluated for its correctness and effectiveness. This is especially important for reset  signals used in each clock domain to ensure proper operation for all possible sequences of reset  removal between clock domains. Additionally, ensure that the latency involved in signal  synchronization is tolerable to the system.     onsider duty cycle in timing analysis for designs that use both clock edges. With justification,  document any designs that pass data from one edge of a clock to the other. Analyze such circuits  using the worst-case duty cycle for each phase. Often designers assume a 50 percent duty cycle,  which may not be the case. Sources of duty cycle distortion include oscillator characteristics,  with 50 +/- 10 percent duty cycles being common, including uneven delays through logic gates  and buffers, etc. Unless required to meet timing, avoid using opposite-edge clocking as it  complicates the timing analysis for the design.   Ensure that proper synchronizers are used for each asynchronous signal to guard against  metastability. Often designers will use two series D-flip-flops (DFFs). While this is a common  and acceptable topology, be aware that for high-speed signals, the failure rate of this  synchronizer can be non-negligible. Analysis has to be done for situations that may require a  third DFF to be put in the series. The following are notable conditions to address:    b. Ensure that there is margin in these circuits as they are impractical to test and verify.  c. Also, note that for ASICs, different flip-flop macros may have significantly different               best practice is to avoid the use of latches because they complicate the timing analysis of a  design. Furthermore, PnR tools do not satisfactorily analyze timing paths with latches. It is not  uncommon that a latch can be replaced in a design by a DFF. Therefore, the recommended  approach is to replace latches with DFFs.    atches can also be unintentionally inferred (added by the tool during synthesis), for example by  not defining all output states. Run a register report after PnR to confirm that there are no latches  present.  FSMs have to be designed with care for critical applications. Verify the implementation at levels  of abstraction appropriate for each circuit. For example, for certain critical sections of an HDL-  based design, examination of the tool-generated netlist via a schematic viewer may be required  to ensure that a reliable circuit has been implemented. There are very few designs with a single  independent state machine. Most designs have several, if not many, interconnected state  machines. Any correction or recovery algorithm (an FPGA or card-level reset, for example)  would need to take into account all of the interconnected state machines and be thoroughly  analyzed and tested in order to verify proper recovery. Note that the correction method may  even reside at a higher level such as at the subsystem or box level.    intended. The analysis also needs to include, especially for critical state machines,  considerations for off-nominal events that could cause faults that interrupt nominal state  transitions. Credible faults could occur because of such hazard events as a disturbance on the  power bus, an electrostatic discharge (ESD) event, a radiation-induced upset, etc. Note that  hazard events are not synchronized to the system clock and the logic network is not guaranteed  to be glitch free.  ny critical state machine has to be robust under all credible faults. In general, analysis of the  combinational circuits that implement the next-state logic and their inputs to the registers making  up the state register is needed. In particular, for any of these schemes, it has to be determined  whether the circuit implementations are static hazard free and, if not, whether an erroneous  transition to a state (or set of states) can occur. It may be very difficult for a user to guarantee  deterministic behavior of the state machine if an upset occurs. This could also be the case for  very large or complex state machines.            The PLD design team addresses FSM lockup at a higher level and analyzes FSM outputs. In  general, each FSM is analyzed to make sure that the system can detect a locked up FSM and  return it to a known state in a timely and safe manner. Recovery options can include an  automated system recovery or an external event (watchdog reset, commanded reset, or power  cycling), if acceptable to the system design. For mission-critical applications, the FSM outputs  have external protection, such as requiring flight software to \u201carm\u201d the FSM outputs.  Implementation of a reset from an external resource (e.g., watchdog timer) can simplify fault  recovery analysis in that the reset forces the entire design associated with that reset into a known  state. Though the externally generated reset would be the preferred approach, if there were no  system-level watchdog available or it does not adequately address an FSM\u2019s response to a fault,  an alternative method could be to implement an onboard watchdog that operates off separate  clock and reset resources.   further recommendation would be to incorporate off-nominal events into the simulation  environment to assess system response, such as verifying a watchdog reset. This assessment  may be extremely valuable given that this functionality may be impossible to test in a hardware  test environment.       practice. The choice of state vector encoding is one that factors in radiation effects, timing  constraints, and criticality of operation. Often, designers allow the synthesis tool to choose the  encoding scheme that is optimal for timing constraints. However, the designer still reviews the  synthesis tool\u2019s choice factoring in radiation effects and criticality of operation. Following are  some factors to consider:  a. In PLDs, if using TMR with triplicated registers, upsets are more common from SETs  than SEUs. Therefore, combinatorial logic poses a greater vulnerability. One-hot encoding uses  more flip-flops, but less combinatorial logic to encode the states and becomes a robust high-  speed option.   decodes all bits in the state, the implementation can recover from an invalid state. However,  when one-hot encoded state machines experience an upset, it is likely that two state bits will  become \u201chot\u201d and activate two parts of the design that aren\u2019t normally activated simultaneously.  The designer determines whether this situation could cause any damage.                   lock up if the FSM interfaces with external logic. In this situation, an SEU could disrupt the  normal sequence of operation.  with error detection and recovery (safing) implemented. As such, avoid over-engineering FSMs.  More specifically, don\u2019t assume that \u201csafing\u201d FSMs individually is better than using one hot  and/or binary FSM encodings without safing. Whether to safe an FSM or not depends on the  system level consequences of an FSM being upset and what recovery actions are needed.      a. Recognized state machines.  b. Lockup states.  dditionally, some logic synthesis tools generate \u201csafe\u201d state machines. Use of this feature is  not recommended because it typically increases the use of combinatorial logic, which increases  the SET susceptibility. If this feature is used, examine the generated design carefully as it could  sometimes add an excessive number of gates to the implementation. Other times, resets are  generated on the opposite edge of the clock resulting in tight timing for the removal of clears that  are not visible to the designer. Note that when using enumerated states in VHDL, not all  physical states are covered (only enumerated states are covered). Hence, the \u201cothers\u201d clause  only refers to states in the enumerated type and not the physical realization. The HDL does not  identify one-hot or binary or gray-coded implementation or which registers have been replicated.  This is not detectable at the black box simulation level or by Boolean equations for logical  equivalence.  c. Outputs from the state machine that can glitch.  d. Unintended register replication.  e. Implementation of the desired and specified style (sometimes the synthesis tool    \u201csyn_preserve\u201d (from Synplicity) can be used to ensure that the synthesis tool does not change  the state encoding.             t is important to understand the purpose of reset implementations. For example, different  approaches are recommended depending on if the reset signal is used to initialize finite state  machines as opposed to protecting external resources (e.g., contention on a tri-state bus,  electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) protection, relay activation,  pyrotechnic initiation).    Failure to reset all registers in a design can cause mismatches between simulation and actual  device. Each flip-flop has either an asynchronous preset or a reset signal. If the flip-flop needs  both a reset and preset condition, one has to be changed to a synchronous signal. If they are both  asynchronous, they can nullify each other since the timing relationship between them is  undetermined. It is important to make sure that the design specification clearly defines all  register states at POR for bits that are directly controlling circuit functions (on- or off-chip)  without first being initialized by software.   PLD is concerned but require board, box and/or system analysis to determine if indeterminate  PLD outputs are acceptable until the synchronous reset is clocked through. Synchronous reset  signals have to be routed on low-skew global routing networks. This is vitally important to  ensure that all synchronous elements in a design are reset at exactly the same time. System reset  is typically active low at the board level because at power on, the board starts at 0 volts so  nothing needs to be done to assert the reset. Inside the PLD, the active state of the reset (high or  low) is dependent on the technology being used. It is best to check the device technology prior  to setting the reset active state. A recommended system reset is asynchronously asserted, and  synchronously de-asserted, with the minimum pulse width required. An analysis is done to  determine the time that the reset is to be asserted and de-asserted. This is design dependent, and  is done for the following reasons:  a. Ensures that the PLD is held in reset at power up even if the clock is not stable.  b. Ensures that the PLD cannot come out of reset in the absence of a clock.  c. Ensures that the internal reset signal is held for a sufficient amount of time to  propagate throughout the chip. This does not allow a glitch on the reset line to cause an internal  race condition.                It is recommended that the team implement synchronous de-asserted reset using a global buffer,  if available. For asynchronous presets and clears, there are two basic parameters that have to be  met. First, there is a pulse width requirement that has to be guaranteed. Second, removing the  preset or clear from a device asynchronously to the clock may result in metastable states in the  sequential circuit. This parameter is frequently called the removal time (asynchronous (clear and  preset) or removal time) and is denoted as tREM. Unfortunately, many data sheets do not specify  the removal time. Use a synchronously de-asserted reset to ensure that the removal time  requirement is met.   rawing a tree of all the reset sources, buffers, and domains is often helpful in ensuring that the  reset logic is well defined. Often there are multiple forms of reset from system resets, software  resets, watchdog timers, etc., and having a detailed tree diagram shows the relationships between  them. Ensure that proper synchronization is made when required. Additionally, if the reset  needs to be activated quickly, the tree helps to ensure that the logic and delays are well  understood. Examples include when there is a need to protect non-volatile memories from false  writes, or other circuits from initiating one-time events, such as firing pyrotechnics or explosives.  he PLD designer reviews/analyzes each I/O\u2019s dynamic and static characteristics, such as  timing, logic threshold, direct current (DC) voltage characteristics, and I/O standard, with the  board designer to take into account the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations to ensure proper  operation of the devices.   dhere to the vendor\u2019s recommendations for handling SSOs. There may be limits to the number  of output pins that can switch at one time. Sometimes the manufacturer specifies these limits in  a data sheet, describes them in an application note, and/or leaves them to the discretion of the  designer. Ground/VDD bounce can be a serious issue that can dynamically affect input switching  thresholds, decrease system noise margins for fast-switching devices with large pin counts, and  lower noise margins. It is also important to note that for many devices, the number of SSOs can  affect the propagation delay time (TPD).  Care and planning is also important for pin assignments. Pin assignments that seem organized  with all the data bits on a bus lined up in a row have been notorious for causing both ground  bounce problems on the printed circuit board (PCB) and routing problems inside PLDs.  Consider using power integrity tools, as they provide a means to accurately predict the effects of  SSOs on a given design. Note the considerations that follow for simultaneous switching outputs,  noise immunity, quiet design principles, and minimizing bounce issues:              together. Refer to the device datasheet for recommendations on allowable SSO signaling per  ground pin.          ground bounce (i.e., high frequency switching pins, pins with fast (short) rise times and  address/data buses).   . Driving test data through the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) test interface,  especially over multiple parts, can induce SSO data patterns, particularly with large data buses.  For example, switching patterns from FFFFFFFF to 00000000. Though this may be an artificial  failure or an artifact of the test, this can damage or potentially overstress hardware through a loss  of control.   voltage I/O standards available. Lower voltage I/Os have lower transient currents that can  reduce SSO.   interference (EMI) tests, presents different conditions for normal bench testing or systems  application. Design for the worst-case over the entire project flow.             usually has more on-chip resources, and can operate at higher speed than the one-time  programmable PLD. The issue with using reconfigurable PLD in space flight or high altitude  vehicles (e.g., High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE)) is its susceptibility to radiation-induced  errors. As a result, additional logic is usually needed to reduce such susceptibility and improve  the device reliability for space applications.   to perform the required logic functions. The internal configuration memory is not always  radiation hardened and can be upset by radiation events. When the configuration memory is  altered through a radiation event, the impacted logic can be permanently changed unless the PLD  configuration memory is reloaded or scrubbed. The upset rate of configuration memory depends  on the PLD technology and the radiation environment.   he simplest form of protection used on PLD configuration memory is open-loop scrubbing.  This consists of using a separate radiation hardened or tolerant device to continuously overwrite  the configuration memory of the PLD with configuration data from a known and reliable source.  This method of protection is easy to implement and can usually correct the upset memory very  quickly. However, its effectiveness depends on the radiation upset rate of the PLD configuration  port. It only works if the PLD configuration port stays healthy. Without a feedback mechanism,  it can sometimes be difficult to determine whether the configuration port is receiving the data  sent by the scrubbing logic. As a result, this method of protecting PLD configuration memory is  usually used along with other protection schemes, such as configuration memory read back or  periodic reconfiguration of the entire PLD.  nother technique is to read back and verify the configuration memory. The content of the  memory can be verified by either comparing it to that from a reliable source or checking the  associated cyclic redundancy check (CRC) signature against the expected value. Once the  configuration memory is deemed corrupted, it can be overwritten with data from the reliable  source. The correction can be done only for the corrupted memory blocks or all the  configuration memory blocks, depending how sophisticated the readback/scrubbing controller  design is. Unlike the scrubbing logic, the readback logic can be implemented inside the  reconfigurable PLD itself as long as the health of the readback logic can be monitored by an  external radiation hardened or tolerant circuit or PLD. This method of configuration memory  protection is more reliable than open-loop scrubbing. Any corruption to the configuration data  or the configuration port can always be detected. The drawback with this approach is that  response time can be slow. Once the corruption is detected, another mechanism, such as open-  loop scrubbing or full reconfiguration, has to be deployed to correct the problem. This is  expected to take more time than using open-loop scrubbing.           TMR is also used for mitigating radiation induced upsets in PLDs. The scheme employs three  copies of the circuit to be protected by TMR and a voting logic. The correct output of the circuit  is determined using majority rule. Feedback logic is sometimes used to correct the errors in the  corrupted copy of the circuit. For reconfigurable PLDs, TMR is usually not built into the PLD.  The designer may need to implement TMR or other methods to mitigate the potential problems  caused by radiation-induced upsets.  Designers need to be aware that there are different TMR methods including Local TMR, Global  TMR, and Distributed TMR. Each has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of protection  afforded versus impacts on device or circuit resource. It is not sufficient to rely solely on  manufacturer\u2019s literature on radiation effects mitigation. For the purposes of this document, it is  recommended that the PLD designer (or design team representative) also consult appropriate  radiation effects engineering resources to determine the optimum method for the intended  application.  TMR can be implemented manually by the designer or by using design tools. Once TMR is  implemented, the designer ensures that the PLD synthesis tool does not reduce the redundant  circuits from the TMR design while optimizing the design.  n-flight reconfiguration is used very carefully if the PLD is performing system-critical  functions. Improperly configured PLD can cause the device to stop functioning in-flight.  Systems designed to support in-flight PLD reconfiguration have to have a fail-safe mode to  restore the system to the last working state in the event of a reconfiguration error. The fail-safe  mode allows the PLD to be reconfigured using the last known reliable configuration file stored  locally in the system, from an external location on the spacecraft, or even from the ground.    onsider adding signals to facilitate design development and debugging. Debugging designs in  the lab comes with many constraints. One of them is visibility of signals. Be sure to allocate test  points or spare pins for diagnostic purposes. There are many steps that a designer can take to  address these constraints, including the examples that follow:   internal signals. Such interfaces can come in very handy, but often come with frequency  limitations and limit the number of signals that can be viewed simultaneously. Be sure to  accommodate the PLD signals associated with the JTAG interface.  . Debug mux. A multitude of internal signals can be brought to a multiplexer whose  output connects to PLD outputs. The multiplexer select signals can be driven by PLD inputs or  by other suitable means. This approach can be used when a PLD\u2019s JTAG interface has  limitations that pose a problem.              c. Heartbeat output. A quick and easy method of checking if a PLD is \u201cfunctional\u201d is to  generate a heartbeat output signal that pulses periodically when certain critical events occur. The  utility of such a signal depends greatly on how the designer chooses to generate the output.    analyzed sufficiently in the final flight design to ensure no impact on in-flight system  functionality or reliability. Ideally, all testability features are disabled for flight.  uring the DDP, detailed design information is generated based on the preliminary design.

(3) Operations constraints.                n order for a PLD to operate correctly, it is important to review and ensure the correctness of the  interface between the PLD and the board on which it resides. The following list provides some  key areas to review for the PLD and board interface:     VPUMP, and VREF for PLDs from MicroSemi and HSWSPEN, INIT_B and PROB_B for  PLDs from Xilinx all have to be terminated properly for the PLD to operate correctly. Review  the PLD datasheet for the requirements about how the special pins are connected, and verify that  the corresponding connections are correct on the board.       cold-sparing and power sequencing requirements are met. Review circuitry that may be powered  independently of the PLD, including cold-sparing applications, and make sure that adequate  protection circuitry is implemented.   undershoots do not violate PLD manufacturer\u2019s absolute maximum ratings for I/O signals.  Using low slew rate for the PLD outputs and terminating the board signals are two effective  methods for reducing ringing levels for board level signals.   board. Make sure that the selections for the pull-ups and pull-downs inside the PLDs are  consistent with those implemented on the circuit board.                        verification process need to be tested. The purpose is to mitigate any risks that may develop as a  result of functions that may not be fully tested during requirements verification.     processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), and/or digital signal processors.  These embedded processors execute software ranging from a simple series of instructions to an  operating system running applications, which is separately developed from the PLD design code.  This Handbook does not cover the development, verification, and validation of software for such  embedded processors. All software will be covered by software requirements in NPR 7150.2,  NASA Software Requirements.         a. The design specification is reviewed and baselined.  b. The interface definition(s) are baselined.  c. The detailed design (from the design specification) is completed.  d. Reviews are completed as defined in the development plan.  he design implementation phase is the phase when the design is implemented, coded, and  reviewed. This occurs after the detailed design is completed. The generated result will be the  PLD programming file(s) that will be used in the verification aspect. During the design  implementation phase, the verification team may begin to implement preliminary versions of the  verification items. These can include test procedures, test scripts, test benches, etc. In addition  to generation of the programming files, the design undergoes several timing analyses, including  STA and worst-case timing analysis.                    a. Transferring the design from the design specification to the HDL code (coding).  b. Incremental testing: Simulations at both the module and chip levels.  c. Reviewing the design files.

For example, the purpose of a  code review is not just to check the stylistic portions of the code, but to ensure that the design is  complete and meets the requirements specified. Issues found at the design file level are much  easier and take fewer resources to fix than those found in various stages of verification.  Prior to any review, the design is deposited in the appropriate revision control system.    he verification team begins development of the test preparation (test benches, test scripts, test  procedures) used for verification and independent testing of the device. This effort can occur in  parallel to the development of the design. Section 9 defines the verification items.                             such as:  A. Flip-flops without sets or clears, indicating circuitry that will not be reset on         B. Flip-flops with both sets and clears, indicating possible asynchronous design  techniques (the absence of set/clear flip-flops does not indicate the absence of  asynchronous design techniques).     rising edge design) that could place constraints on clock symmetry and be  more difficult to analyze with the STA tool.                                e. Timing analysis in the synthesis phase can be used as an indication of long timing  paths and of predicted timing. However, accurate timing analysis can only be achieved from a  STA that is performed after PnR.   the source and destination clock domains have not been replicated. Replicated flip-flops in  synchronizers can result in intermittent functional failures.

PLD timing requirements are  derived from all of the PLD\u2019s interface components to ensure timing compatibility. Constraints  are applied as needed to the synthesis and/or PnR software to meet all timing requirements.    timing and functionality are both met.  8.4.2 Timing Analysis                 a. Temperature.  b. Voltage.  c. Radiation \u2013 total ionizing dose (TID).  d. Process (speed grade, best/worst).  e. Aging.  PLD vendors try to provide timing estimates, which are based on user-specified environmental  values or ranges, that envelope the effects of all of these factors. The effects of some factors  (such as radiation and aging) are harder to predict than others. Therefore, positive timing  margins (margin on top of margin), such as 20 percent at initial PnR and 10 percent for the final,  are preferred. For example, prolonged radiation exposure can slow down some circuit elements  and/or speed up others within the same device. In addition, logic upsets due to transient  radiation events are addressed, but not as part of timing analyses.  Timing analyses may need to be run with more than one set of environmental conditions and  resolved into an overall set of minimum and maximum values that envelope the values from  various environmental conditions. The number of environmental condition combinations  analyzed is often referred to as the number of corners analyzed. An example of a two-corner  analysis is shown in the table 3, Example of Two-Corner Analysis, below.  Table 3\u2014Example of Two-Corner Analysis  125 \u00b0C  3.0V and 1.35V 3.6V and 1.65V  100 krads  STD  0 krads  -1  Best/Min  -55 \u00b0C  Condition  Worst/Max \n Temperature  Voltage  Radiation  Process (speed grade)  Process (best/worst) Worst  Best              The types of timing analyses needed depend on the functional types of inputs, outputs and  internally generated signals in the PLD. The types of timing analyses are as follows:  a. Clock frequency.  b. Reset pulse widths.  c. Asynchronous input pulse widths.  d. Synchronizer metastability settling time.  e. Synchronous input setup and hold times.  f. Combinatorial input pulse widths.  g. Synchronous output delays.  h. Combinatorial output delays.  i. Clock domain crossings.  Typically, several types of timing analyses are needed to show that a PLD design will perform  properly. For example, a PLD design with a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) interface  would need clock frequency, synchronous input setup and hold times, and synchronous clock-to-  output timing analyses to show compliance to PCI interface timing requirements.   TA software is used to calculate the maximum clock frequency for each clock domain that uses  dedicated, skew-safe clock circuitry. This is typically the first timing check designers perform to  see if their design implementation works at the required clock frequency(ies). Specify a  frequency for each clock domain in the PLD to constrain the PnR software so that the required  frequency(ies) is achieved. Specifying frequency constraints enables the STA software to report  pass/fail status.  or clock domains that pass signals between both edges of the clock, account for duty cycle  variations. Note that rising versus falling edge delay differences inside the PLD contribute to  duty cycle variations.  f the maximum clock frequency reported by the STA software is not fast enough, review the  slowest paths and consider using a faster speed grade PLD, redesigning the logic and/or  determining if multi-cycle clock constraints can be applied. Slow paths sometimes consist of  signals that functionally have two or more clocks cycles to settle. For these paths, consider  adding multi-cycle timing constraints.  void clock domains that do not use dedicated skew-safe clock circuitry because using them  may require more manual effort (analysis and/or structural design modifications) to preclude  internal setup and hold timing violations.                esets that assert and negate asynchronously to the PLD\u2019s clock domain(s), such as power-on  resets, are often synchronized before being distributed throughout the PLD. Resets are often  asynchronously asserted and synchronously negated, so that all sequential elements are  initialized as soon as possible but released from reset on the same clock event. Analyze  synchronized resets, as well as synchronously generated resets, like synchronous inputs to  sequential elements even though these drive the asynchronous inputs. This will sufficiently  negate the synchronized reset before the next clock event so that all sequential elements come  out of reset together.     nalyze asynchronous inputs that synchronize to clock domains inside the PLD to ensure the  minimum low and high pulse widths needed by the synchronizing circuit(s) in the routed PLD  are less than the minimum low and high pulse widths of the input.   The minimum low and high pulse width of a \u201cstandard\u201d two flip-flip synchronizer (shift register)  is not just its clock period. The minimum low and high pulse width is the sum of the flip-flip\u2019s  clock period, setup time and hold time and the rise versus fall time variances of the input\u2019s path  to the first flip-flop.   lip-flops used to capture asynchronous signals may have longer clock-to-output settling times  when setup or hold times are violated due to metastability settling in the flip-flop. Although it is  possible to have a flip-flop\u2019s output oscillate indefinitely due to metastability, it is unlikely the  feedback paths in the flip-flop will be perfectly matched to sustain this.  synchronized on every clock edge. It may be better to design and analyze these as gated  synchronous inputs.    he typical synchronizing circuit consists of two or three flip-flops connected as a shift register.  For each synchronizer, ensure the path from the first flip-flop to the second has sufficient timing  margin (slack) to account for metastability settling. Having margin is typically not an issue if  there is no combinatorial logic between these flip-flops and these flip-flops are usually placed  close together. It may be worth adding a maximum path delay constraint for each synchronizer  from the first flip-flop to the second that is less than the clock period to help ensure margin for  metastability settling.                   TA software can be used to calculate the minimum setup and hold times needed for each  synchronous input pin. Setup and hold constraints can be specified to guide the PnR software  and enable the STA software to report pass/fail status.   setup and hold timing on every clock edge. For these types of inputs, it may be worthwhile to  constrain the setup and/or hold times to values larger than the clock period, as appropriate. This  is analogous to multi-cycle timing constraints.    nalyze combinatorial inputs used to drive outputs without being clocked to ensure the rise  versus fall time variances through the combinatorial logic do not exceed the input\u2019s minimum  pulse widths. Otherwise the input pulse could be missed and not reach the output or significantly  distort the output pulse shape. This could cause glitches that produce unwanted outputs. It is  recommended that outputs be clocked.    or designs where the output delay relative to the clock matters, STA software can be used to  calculate the minimum and maximum clock-to-output delays. Minimum and maximum clock-to-  output delay constraints can be specified to guide the place-and-route software and enable the  STA software to report pass/fail status.     or designs where the output delay relative to its input(s) matters, STA software is used to  calculate the minimum and maximum input to output delays. Constraints for minimum and  maximum input to output delays are specified to guide the PnR software and enable the STA  software to report pass/fail status.                       The timing analysis shows that each CDC works properly and includes dispositions for each  signal involved in the CDC. The clock domains have either fixed or (more often) varying clock  edge timing relationships.  ynchronous CDCs may be able to take advantage of guaranteed timing relationships between  the source and destination clock domains and use STA to verify setup and hold times for their  control signals.  Asynchronous CDCs have to work with all timing relationships (leading, lagging and co-  incident) between the source and destination clock edges. Asynchronous CDC control signals  are analyzed using asynchronous pulse width timing analysis.  Setup and hold timing analysis are used for the data signals of CDCs. More specifically, the  analysis shows that data presented on the appropriate source clock edge meets the setup and hold  times needed by the appropriate destination clock edge. CDCs may be designed to hold data for  multiple clocks before and/or after control signal transitions to facilitate meeting these setup and  hold times.    esign is baselined in the appropriate configuration control system. This includes design source  files, simulation test benches, script files used during simulation, synthesis, and PnR. The goal is  to keep everything required for design implementation and verification under configuration  control so that the design can be reliably reproduced.  his phase includes generating the PLD design per the design. The design may not be the  complete design but may be the completed section(s) per the plan. It includes the process to  synthesize, PnR, and generate the programming files for the design.    a. Design implemented in HDL is baselined.  b. Simulations are completed.  c. Reviews per the development plan are completed.             files(s) to ensure that versions of all source files and tools are identified. If required, it can serve  as an as-run procedure. In addition, the procedure can contain SMA witness or acceptance. The  procedure serves as a standard method to generate the programming file(s) that maintain a  detailed list of what source files are used. By tracking the versions of the source files, changes  and modifications are easily tracked through revision control. The procedure may contain the  following information:                  mplementing the design is the process by which the build (or implementation) procedure is used  to generate the programming file(s) that are required. A separate build procedure is used for  each PLD that is generated. When implementing the design, the design files are first to be  placed in the appropriate CM system. The procedure is then run with the appropriate level of  SMA required by the project. The resulting programming files are then put in the appropriate  revision control repository.                a. The design implementation is complete.  b. Reviews are completed as defined in the development plan:            (1) Timing Constraints.  (2) Synthesis.  (3) PnR.  (4) Timing Analysis.

See section 5 for a description  of verification planning.  he verification begins with a discussion of the test process and test procedures. Test procedures  have to be completed prior to verification, but are described here because they logically fall into  the verification phase.                       b. A successful build of the device is maintained under version control.  c. A programming procedure is baselined.           test procedure is a document that delineates the test steps required to verify full compliance of  the PLD implementation to the requirements. It is to be written clearly, so that it can be handed  to an independent tester. The test procedure may include topics such as:  . Requirements addressed by the test case.  c. Test configuration(s) (recorded information about the test setup, such as software       . Test input (things required as input to the test, e.g., test scripts).  f. Instructions for conducting the test.  g.

Any discrepancies encountered are handled according to the project error tracking process.  Section 10.1 describes the programming test procedure in detail.     board. The amount of testing required is dependent on the functionality. Simulation for  verification may not always be appropriate. For example, the simulation of the digital interface  of an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter does not verify the operation of the A/D converter. The  verification of the A/D conversion circuit can only take place on the hardware. However, it is  advantageous to simulate the operation to ensure that the appropriate signals are operating as  expected.    a. Off-nominal operation.  b. Hardware failures.  c. Basic command operation.  d. Internal operation of the PLD.  hen using simulation for formal verification, a self-checking test bench is the best method.  The test bench that is used for formal verification is reviewed during the review process. The  test bench review is set up to ensure appropriate operation and requirements verification.  It is a best practice to simulate all functionality of the PLD prior to running on the actual  hardware even if formal verification is not gained.       a. Assign a test number to the test cases for tracking purposes.  b. Use self-checking/documenting test benches.  c. Analyze code coverage of simulation and test vectors.                    d.

It is a best practice to obtain models from the vendor so that the appropriate delays are correct.  Some simulation tools come with models. Check with the tool vendor for their models.                     a. Waveforms for sanity check.  b.

Code coverage analysis is performed for statement coverage, toggle  coverage, branch coverage, and expression coverage. All of these coverage analyses can  uncover deficiencies in the design simulation. Coverage analysis is used frequently while  implementing the design to assess the completeness of the simulation test benches.   Simulation code coverage analysis provides a useful measure on the thoroughness of the  simulation test benches. A design is only released after it has been thoroughly simulated.  Though it is desirable to have a high simulation coverage, setting up a hard coverage requirement  is not practical. Achieving high simulation coverage can sometimes be very laborious and time  consuming and not be supported by the project schedule.    Instead of imposing requirements on the code coverage level, the designers disposition all the  coverage deficiencies flagged by the code coverage tool. Reviewing coverage deficiencies helps  the designer understand the cause of the deficiencies and determine how they need to be  addressed. In the disposition, the designer documents the rationale for the coverage deficiency  and risk associated with not addressing this deficiency. The dispositions are released along with  the coverage report as part of the final EIDP of the PLD design. The disposition for the coverage  deficiencies and the coverage report provide a metric for the quality of the design simulation.  They are treated as part of the design documentation and released along with the design.   timing delay models extracted for the worst-case and best-case operating conditions. The  designer bases the design simulated during the back-annotated simulation on the final HDL net  list produced by the PnR tool and models of the logic primitives specific to the targeted PLD  device. The back-annotated simulation is performed using maximum, typical, and minimum              timing models. PLD design is verified with back-annotated simulation before each formal  release. By running a post PnR structural simulation with unit delay (without the timing  information), the designer can verify that the design is accurate. The value of a unit delay post  PnR structural simulation is that it may execute significantly faster.  assing the back-annotated simulation proves that the design is not altered by the synthesis and  PnR process. It also validates the timing constraints used during the synthesis and PnR process  when the back-annotated simulation is performed using the best and worst timing delay models.   to re-run every test in back-annotated mode. The designer needs to decide which parts of the  simulation need to be re-run using back-annotated design.   f a failure occurs during testing, the designer investigates the failure. This investigation needs  to include root-cause determination, which is necessary to ensure that a proposed solution  resolves the failure. The designer may need to generate a new PLD version and perform  regression testing. The amount of regression testing depends on the level of functionality where  the failure occurred. Automated, self-checking test benches will help simplify regression testing.  The verification plan clearly defines the details and corrective actions of test failures.    The designer may initiate replacement or reprogramming of a device due to a test failure. The  designer will establish a new design baseline prior to programming a configuration-controlled  device with a new design. Section 10.1 discusses programming practices.  ndependent verification is an approach used to provide higher confidence in the outcome of the  verification process, by avoiding the inadvertent masking of design errors that can sometimes  occur if the same personnel are responsible for both design and the design verification. A classic  example is the misinterpretation of a requirement: If both are designed, tested, and analyzed by  the same person with the same misinterpretation, the design can pass the verification, but still not  meet the requirement. The use of independent personnel for verification is highly recommended  in cases where sufficient personnel, cost, and schedule are available. There is additional  overhead for maintaining separate personnel for design and verification that may be prohibitive  for some projects; however, without this measure, those projects will have to decide whether to  accept an increased risk.  s with all verification activities, independent verification can occur at any point throughout the  life cycle, including simulation, analysis, developmental tests (e.g., \u201cbreadboard,\u201d \u201cengineering  model,\u201d etc.), or integration tests with software or higher level systems. The design team may           also utilize independent verification for items such as IP or other non-developmental items used  as part of their design approach.  n those cases where the outcome of independent verification is a required step in the developer\u2019s  process, the design team has to identify those constraints early in the development to allow for  adequate planning and schedule.   he verification team verifies the design team\u2019s work products from all phases of the life cycle  against the same set of requirements used by the design team. In order for an independent team  to begin verification, they have to use the same set of requirements used by the design team. In  addition, the verification team has to have access to all the design products (e.g., HDL, constraint  files, etc.), as well as documentation from the design team, including traceability reports, full  descriptions of any derived requirements, or design features that were incorporated. For testing,  the independent team generates test cases and procedures per the verification plan and verifies  the functionality based on the requirements.  primarily as a way to begin to understand how the design operates but also generates its own test  benches to use.           ommunication between the design and verification teams is of paramount importance for  independent peer verification. The term \u201cindependent\u201d is not to be interpreted as a ban to  communication, including (where appropriate) direct contact and discussion about the design,  and any verification issues found. A successful outcome is achieved through a thorough  understanding of the work of each team.  Traditionally, design activities and independent verification activities could be divided into  separate phases, where the design team handed off the design to the verification team, and then a  verification report was provided back to the design team. The design team could then address  any required changes and iterate through the verification team until all issues were resolved. In           owever, a more iterative model utilizes ongoing development (including correction of issues  previously found by verification) concurrently with verification activities. Verification activities  can span multiple iterations of the design cycle that leads ultimately to the final product. This  can result in multiple versions, with differing issues, and different iterations of changes. In this  scenario, communication is of even greater importance. Ultimately, both the design and  verification teams have to converge upon one final design supported by successful verification  results.  this scenario, written documentation, such as design and version description documents and  verification reports (see section 9.5), are the primary formal means of communication.   \u201cbug tracker\u201d tool (usually electronic) is one valuable way of achieving communication  between the design and verification teams, particularly in cases where the two activities are  active in parallel. The bug tracker provides not only communication, but assists in traceability of  changes, and development of the Version Description Document (VDD). See section 5.2.8 for  additional information about bug tracker tools.  he developer and/or an independent party, as defined in the development plan, can perform the  verification review. The verification process ensures that the PLD meets all the requirements for  development and design of the project.           a. Overall success/failure evaluation of the verification.  b. Any known deficiencies, limitations, or constraints.  c. Any results of any corrective actions that were assigned during the verification process.  d. Impacts of any items listed.  e. Verification environment including impacts.  f. Verification results:  (1) Project unique identifier of test and procedure.  (2) Details of results with traceability.           (3) Problems/anomalies encountered.  (4) Deviations from test cases.   (1) Date and time of the verification.  (2) Verification environment, hardware and software configuration.  (3) Identification of individuals who performed the verification.  A verification report does not necessarily mean a separate document. The report can be an as-run  test procedure, provided the team records all pertinent information in the test procedure.  regression plan is to be developed that will indicate what testing needs to occur as changes are  made. A basic form of a regression plan can be a regression matrix, as seen in table 4,  Regression Testing, below.   Function 1  Function 2  Function 3    Test Procedure 2  X  X  Test Bench 1  X      t is desirable to have the test environment for hardware verification resemble the final  configuration to achieve a higher level of confidence in the test results. This can include the use  of hardware emulators, simulation software, flight hardware, qualification hardware, certification  hardware, certification software, and flight software.  evices used for the final deliverable article are preferred for the final verification of a PLD  design. For cases in which the final deliverable is a one-time programmable PLD and there are  budget and schedule constraints, verification may be performed on a prototype device prior to  the final deliverable. In these cases, it is recommended that the prototype device closely  resemble the final part.  n addition to the choice of prototyping devices, it is also important to perform hardware  verification using high fidelity test interfaces and stimuli. If simulators produce the test stimuli,                                 hen the PLD design contains a software interface, it is recommended that the PLD be tested  with the final software, such as the flight software. Though test software is sometimes sufficient  for verifying the PLD software interface, it typically does not operate the PLD the same way as  the final software. Test results obtained using test software have lower fidelity than those from  testing using the final software.  it is important to have the behavior of the simulator verified against the final interfaces and  document any non-compliance.       a. All as-run test procedures and test reports are released.  b. All review documents are released.  c. All documents that have changed are released.  d. EIDP is released.  e. Anomalies are documented and dispositioned.  f. All requirements for this release are verified             board or assembly level testing. Delivery of the device requires that related design  documentation and data products be completed and released under CM control. This includes,  but is not limited to, items identified as follows:     design or to recreate the design when needed. Following is a list of as-built design files  released when the design is delivered:             (6) Synthesis Transcript/Log File: Includes the synthesis transcript/log file for the as-  built design. Additional documentation is provided for the disposition of all the  synthesis warnings.  7) PnR Project and Script Files: Includes all the design database and binary files  produced during the PnR process. The goal is to have all the files necessary to  regenerate the fuse/configuration/programming file when needed.   9) PnR Transcript/Log File: Includes the PnR transcript/log file generated for the as-  built design. Additional documentation is included for the disposition of the PnR  warnings.                     (10) PLD Programming File: The \u201cfuse/configuration/programming\u201d file for the design.  Necessary precautions are required to preserve the integrity of the programming file  when transferring the programming file from one computer platform to another.  11) Design Review Reports: Includes review reports for all design reviews held for the  delivered design and evidence supporting the closure of the action items from those  reviews.  12) PLD Design Drawing: The drawing that documents the PLD vendor information,  PLD vendor part number, tool used for developing the design (including licensing  information), and the revision and/or the last modification date of all the files listed  above. All the design files referenced in this drawing are released under this  drawing number as supporting documents.                   In addition to the above files and documents, the team also releases a drawing or equivalent  documentation along with the design to document how to label the programmed device and how  it can be clearly linked to its source design files.                      programming and, when required, post-programming, test procedure is developed for each  design. The design team can capture the programming procedure in a document or in an altered  item drawing (AID). As a minimum, the procedure contains the following information:       installing the device into the programming hardware, loading the design files into the  programmer, configuring the programmer for the specific device, ensuring appropriate ESD,  programming the device, etc.   . Verify the expected checksum against that reported by the programmer based on the  fuse information loaded from the programming file. Verify the expected checksum against that  reported by the programmer based on the fuse information read back from the programmed  device.                     Once programmed, a PLD becomes an application-specific part. The manufacturer\u2019s part  number no longer identifies it. The design team assigns a unique identifier or a project part  number to the programmed device. Typically, instructions for programming and marking a  programmed PLD are captured in a design specific AID and the drawing number, serial number,  and revision information for the AID becomes the part number marked on the programmed PLD.   products required by the EIDP, such as the design source files, synthesis, and PnR transcripts,  and, most importantly, the programming files. In addition, the team also releases an AID or  equivalent document to link the EIDP revision information and design specific information, such  as fuse checksum or design date code, to the marking or part number of the programmed device.  t is very helpful if the PLD is designed with a software readable identifier or label. This is  usually implemented by storing the identifier or label, including the design revision information,  in a software accessible register. When such an implementation exists, it is also important to  document software accessible identification in the AID or equivalent document.   LD maintenance considerations are different depending on the design\u2019s place in its life cycle.  This section describes designs as either active or retired. The determination of the category of a  design is based on the life cycle plan developed by the delivering organization. The rules used to  make this determination are based on factors like the delivering organization\u2019s lifetime guarantee  on the design and whether an active project is currently using the design.  t is recommended that the delivering organization establish a design library (revision control or  CM) to store designs. Maintaining an active design in the library is a job focused on protecting  the pedigree of the design from the modifications performed by projects. The delivering  organization is responsible for ensuring that the design has been verified with the appropriate  level of rigor before submitting the design to the library.  t is recommended that projects refrain from inheriting designs directly from each other and  instead go through the design library. This ensures that the organization can play its role in  protecting the pedigree of the design. Direct project-to-project inheritance of designs bypasses  this important role of the organization.   The delivering organization is typically not able to make design changes without project funding.  Therefore, track the desired design changes with designs in the library. They can be  implemented and verified when project funding becomes available and the new revision of the  design can be accepted back into the library.           ctive designs are those that the organization has released under configuration control and used  on active projects. Other projects have to be able to retrieve the design from a library under CM  and immediately put to use. This includes the following:   a. Its specification is kept up to date.  b. Problems reported against the design have been documented.  c. Its tool chain is maintained in working order.  anomalies and changes to the requirements. When this occurs, there are two options: Fix the  anomaly, or use the design as-is. Fixing an anomaly may be the preferred solution. However,  the complexity associated with making a change involves a risk trade.    Making a change to a design reintroduces that design into the design process and sets it back to  an appropriate design phase. The design modification has to progress through the same  processes with the same rigor until a new final design can be delivered to the customer. Along  with the design process, the project team considers schedule and budget effects.  esign problems considered to be use-as-is are documented as a design idiosyncrasy in the  appropriate level of documentation. Capturing the idiosyncrasy preserves intent behind the  design and provides a path for product improvement. At a minimum, the design specification is  updated to document the as-built behavior and the idiosyncrasy is clearly identified.    for active designs no longer apply, but the organization keeps all retired designs available for  reference and study. As part of the life cycle plan, it defines a format for storage of these  designs. The selected format focuses on longevity because designs may be stored for a very long  time. When a design is originally released as active, a copy of the design in this designated  format has to accompany it. This way, as the design ages and is considered retired, the design  knowledge is stored in an electronic format which is backed-up.                  he intermediate or engineering releases are interim releases that add functionality or correct  issues. As the intermediate releases are saved, an active note of the changes with rationale for  the changes are documented and maintained. Other items in the notes include issues found and  testing completed. This allows multiple developers/users to understand the changes and a single  developer to remember why the changes were made. The version number increases each time  the release is changed and checked back into the revision control tool. A developer may group  multiple changes into an intermediate release. Note: Some engineering releases may be used in  preliminary hardware/software integration (HSI) testing. These releases are usually  accompanied with the VDD or drawing.  he final release is the release provided to the customer or stakeholder as the final product. This  release has completed verification as defined in the development plan and is accompanied with a  released EIDP.     his section provides guidelines aimed at ensuring the quality of PLD designs from out-of-house  contracts and procurements. These guidelines can be customized based on the criticality or class  of the mission, complexity of the application, or maturity of the design (new, minor  modifications, re-use).   . The vendor provides NASA insight into the PLD design, development, and test  activities, including monitoring verification adequacy; trade study data; auditing the PLD design  and development process; and participation in PLD reviews and technical interchange meetings.                     1. Issue contract requirements for vendors to deliver a PLD development plan that describes  the vendor\u2019s process for developing flight PLD applications, and deliver the PLD design  data packages for each PLD, which contains all the required data elements to perform an  independent review of the design.    2. Review and acceptance of the vendor\u2019s submitted PLD development plan.  3. Participate in agreed-to reviews to assess vendor\u2019s compliance to the approved PLD   4. Review and acceptance of the PLD design data.  5. Continue review and assessment of flight PLDs throughout the integration and test               his initial step is to ensure that all vendors providing hardware for the instruments and  spacecraft are contractually obligated to deliver a PLD development plan (see section 5.2)  describing the vendor\u2019s methodologies for developing flight PLD solutions, and the complete set  of artifacts that allow for an independent review of all flight PLD projects developed by the  vendor. These two sets of requirements are depicted in the subsections that follow.                    The PLD design data package includes the same information defined in section 10. The PLD  design data package has to contain all source code and design files indicated in section 10. Be  sure that purchased IP licensing agreements allow NASA to view all source code, have access to  all design files, and remain valid during the entire maintenance cycle.     everal iterations may be required until the final version of the vendor\u2019s PLD development plan  is accepted by NASA. It is also possible that the plan is modified over the lifetime of the project  to adjust to the reality of the system development. Every modification of the plan requires  formal acceptance by NASA.   n accordance with the vendor process described in the approved PLD development plan, NASA  representatives may participate in peer review meetings. The PLD reviewer representing NASA  is expected to receive the review materials (presentations, requirements, specifications, test  descriptions, source code, etc.) at least a week before the scheduled date of the meeting. The  reviewer reads all the material in preparation for the meeting. After the meeting, the reviewer  prepares a summary report for the flight project management as a record of his/her participation  in the meeting.  he PLD reviewer fulfills two roles in the peer review meetings. First, the reviewer provides  expertise to support the review team in assessing the state of the project, making suggestions for  corrections and/or improvements. Second, the reviewer assesses whether the vendor is following  the process described in the approved PLD development plan.  t a point(s) established in the approved PLD development plan, the vendor supplies NASA  with a PLD design data package. For simple revisions to PLDs, one review may be sufficient  after PnR, timing analysis, and signal integrity analysis have been completed. Typically, a  minimum of two reviews are warranted, one concurrent with the beginning of non-flight testing  and one prior to commitment of the final design.              The vendor reviews and assesses all NASA PLD design findings and recommendations. The  vendor notifies NASA of those instances where corrective action was not taken on specific PLD  design findings and recommendations.  t is recommended that the reviewer utilize a PLD design checklist to perform the analysis of the  design (one suggestion is included in Appendix B). The checklist can also be provided to the  vendors as a guide for them to prepare their designs for independent review.  he independent review is complete when all findings have been dispositioned/resolved or, if  not, risks are identified and bounded. The reviewer submits a report to the appropriate flight  project manager with all the responses to any findings and notifications and the final version of  the checklist with comments and responses.  n alternative method to independently review a PLD design data package is to assemble an  independent review board at the vendor\u2019s facility. A PLD subject matter expert chosen by the  flight project leads the review board. The vendor provides the complete PLD design data  package the least two weeks prior to the review board meeting.    the review board meeting. At the meeting, concerns and recommendations are discussed and  action items are assigned. The lead reviewer is responsible for taking action items and follow-up  on their resolution.  recommendations. The vendor notifies NASA of those instances where they decided not to take  corrective action on specific PLD design findings and recommendations.   A PLD subject matter expert chosen by the project performs an independent assessment of the  vendor submitted PLD design data.

A PLD design checklist is a helpful tool to assist both the designer and subsequent reviewers.  The checklist can be used during the design process to ensure all aspects are covered that can  then be reviewed during design reviews. A sample design checklist follows. The files that may  be needed in the design reviews are as follows:  a. PLD design specification.  b. PLD verification matrix.  c. Synthesis script/project file.  d. Synthesis constraints file.  e. Preliminary synthesis log/transcript file.  f. PnR script/project file/database file(s).  g. PnR constraints file.  h. PnR log/transcript file.  i. Worst-case timing analysis report.  j. Fuse or bit file.  k. Design source files.  l. Test bench files.  m. Board schematic drawing and net list.  n. Data sheet for components connected directly to the PLD.  o. Other script files used during design, simulation, synthesis, and PnR.  p. Action item status summary from earlier reviews (gating and peer reviews).  q. A readme file describing the simulation environment and setup to help reviewers              Is the design specification using required  format? If not, list the deficiencies.  In order to facilitate the review process, it is  desirable to have a template for the design  specification.   Is the design specification complete?  Does it have sufficient details for design  implementation and verification? If not,  identify the deficiencies.   Check the design specification against  the board schematic/netlist. List I/Os  with internal and external pullups.  Identify all the I/O standards used in this  design. Are the internal and external  terminations compatible? Do the pin  assignments agree? Is the correct I/O  standard used for the intended use?  The design specification is complete enough to  start a code walk-through. The peer review is  delayed if the design specification is deemed  immature. The design specification provides  sufficient information about the design to allow  the peer review reviewer to perform an  effective review of the HDL source code.  Need to double check the interfaces between  the PLD and the board. Need to ensure that the  physical requirements, such as I/O standard,  pin assignment and I/O type, imposed by the  board designs, are met.                     The code is to be well commented to make it  readable and inheritable by others. See  Appendix A for recommended header/trailer  template.  Review Item  Does each design module have required  header/trailer (when applicable)?  Is the design, HDL source code (or  equivalent) well commented?  an one understand the flow of the  design using only the comments?  s there an International Traffic in Arms  Regulations (ITAR) warning included in  all source files, if it is required on the  project?  Is the HDL code (or equivalent) easy to  follow? Identify improvements for  better readability.  The code has to be readable to the reviewer to  have a meaningful review. The statements  need to be short and concise.  Regardless of the coding style adopted, it is  always easier to follow the code when the style  is consistent. This is also true with signal  names.  Excessive long lines and inconsistent  indentation can make the HDL source difficult  to read.  Is there a consistent coding style in the  source code?  s there a consistent signal naming  convention?  Does the HDL source code contain  excessively long lines?  s there proper indentation in the source  file for readability? Are the indentations  consistent (same number of spaces, no  mixing tabs with spaces)?                              Are there any recommended  coding/implementation optimizations?  The designer can sometimes overlook simple  things. The reviewer can sometimes spot  design optimizations not seen by the designer.  Reasonably optimized code can be reviewed  more easily.                  Is the design matching its specification?  Identify the inconsistencies if there are  any.  The design specification and the design need to  be consistent.  If there are any parameters used for  customizing the design for different design  instances, an autonomous process, such as the  use of scripts, is developed to ensure that the  parameters are set correctly for the targeted  application.  Need to make sure that there is a reliable  process to set up these variables correctly  during the build process.  Does the HDL use any  constants/parameter in the design?   f so, how are they adjusted to ensure the  proper values assigned for a specific  design instance?  requiring adjustments between different  design instances (engineering model  versus flight model)?   Are there any global  definitions/variables, and \u201cifdef\u2019s\u201d in the  source files?  f so, are they set up correctly for the  intended applications?                         Review Item  How many clock domains are there?     clock domains. Need to understand how the  pulsed signals are de-metastabilized when the  signals are going from a fast to a slow clock  domain.  Clocks need to be buffered using global  buffers.     The FSM code is clear enough for review.  FSM outputs need to be registered to avoid  potential glitches caused by state transition.     ow many signals cross clock domains?  Are the signals pulsed or leveled signals?   How are the signals buffered/de-meta-  stabilized, for both signals going from  fast to slow and slow to fast clock  domains?   hen the reset is used in multiple clock  domains, is it de-asserted synchronously  to the clock from the domain?       How many FSMs are in the design?  Can the logic flow in the FSM be  understood easily?                    Need to identify potential lock-up states and  look for undefined states in the FSM. FSM  designs contain a default condition. Need to  ensure that the default conditions are capable  of directing the FSM back to a safe state in the  event of an SEU.  Using vendor/device specific primitives makes  the design less portable.  Are all the states used in the FSMs  defined? Do the default conditions in the  FSM direct the FSM to a valid safe  state?  re there any states polling for status? If  so, is there potential for them to become  lock-up states?  Are there any vendor/device specific  primitives used in the design? If so, why  are they used?  Are the vendor SSO-related  recommendations followed? If not, is  there power integrity analysis data  available to show acceptable noise level  on the ground and power planes?  SSO causes ground bounce and reduce noise  margin. Need to identify these signals in  advance so that proper measure can be taken to  alleviate its impact.     Derived and gated clocks tend to create  asynchronous designs. It is sometimes hard to  weed out timing problems with asynchronous  designs.    Are there any derived or gated clocks?  Are both edges of a clock used in the  circuit? If so to either, how are they  used? Are there any potential timing  issues with the way they are used?    Are there any potential race conditions?  (This is hard to tell without deep design  penetration).  Race conditions cause the design to behave  unpredictably.                         Is there any register using only  synchronous reset? If so, what is risk of  having an undefined state for that  register? For registers driving output  signals, what is done to ensure a  deterministic state for these output  signals if synchronous reset is used?  Need to make sure that the outputs of the PLD  have deterministic state during POR. Using  synchronous reset can create brief uncertain in  the outputs.   Do all the \u201ccase\u201d (or equivalent)  structures have a default state? List all  cases with a default state.  Need to make sure the case structure has all  possible cases covered.   Are there any IP or inherited design  modules in the design? If so, are all  inputs to the top level IP or inherited  modules either connected to a signal  source or terminated? Are all the unused  outputs from the top level IP or inherited  modules left unconnected?  IP or inherited design modules are expected to  have unused functions, inputs and outputs.  Unused inputs at the top level need to be  properly terminated and unused outputs need to  be left unconnected.   Are register clears always using an  explicit action? If not so, described how  they are cleared.  Do not want to clear any registers  inadvertently.                      Too many warnings tend to cover up real  problems.  Need to understand if the design is constrained  adequately. Over or under constraining the  design can lead to unreliable product.  Does the preliminary synthesis report  have warnings?   Review the synthesis and PnR constraint  files.         Are control bits that activate different  functional behavior independently  controllable without knowledge of prior  bit states?    Are all software writeable registers  readable?  Do not want write-only register. Need to be  able to verify the content of register after write  access.   Is there any feed-through network (input  pin tied directly to output pin without  going through any flip-flops)?  Hard to control the timing of feed-through  network.                                 Are there any tool-specific synthesis  directives embedded in the HDL source  code? If so, why are they needed?  Need to understand why the synthesis  directives are used.  Could the design be altered by the  synthesis tool in any way during the  synthesis process?  Need to make sure that the synthesis tool does  not unintentionally change the FSM design,  replicate registers or logic blocks, etc.    Need to review the synthesis directives and  settings. As a minimum, review the following  information:   Device technology.  - Part number.  - Package.  - Speed grade.  - FSM encoding control*.  - FSM optimization control*.  - Resource sharing setting.  - Fan-out limit.   to be TURNED OFF. This allows the design  entered by the designer to stay unaltered during  the synthesis process. In Synplicity, for  example, the symbolic_fsm_compiler has to be  set to zero to preserve the FSM encoding  scheme selected by the designer.   Is the synthesis script/project set up  correctly?                   If \u201cifdef\u201d is used in the source code, is  the synthesis environment set up for the  right \u201cifdef\u201d conditions?  \u201cifdef\u201d can change the as-built design. Need to  make sure the right variables are defined in  synthesis.   What device/package/speed  grade/operating voltages is the project  set up for? Are the parameters correct?  Need to review the PnR directives and settings.  Need to review (when applicable):  - Device family.  - Package type.  - Speed grade.  - Die voltage.  - I/O voltage.                 or MicroSemi, need to review the selection of  the following options (when applicable) for the  fuse file:  Rationale  Need to review the fuse/bit file generation  settings.   Are clamping diodes for unused I/O pins  disabled?  - What programming algorithm is selected?  - Is JTAG reset pull-up resistor used?  - Is the global set fuse used?  - Is Antifuse security feature enabled? (This  feature is not desired.)  parameters for Bitgen:  - Setting for HswapenPin.  - Setting for UnusedPin.  - Is DONE pin driven after completion of  configuration?  - Is PERSIST set if configuration readback is  used?   The environment has to be set up correctly for  the tool to perform the STA correctly. Need to  review set up on:  - Operating temperature range.  - Operating voltage range.    Identify the parameters for fuse/bit file  generation. Are they set up correctly?   What operating environment is the PnR  tool set up for? Is it consistent with the  expected operating environment?                  What are the flip-flop, combinatorial  logic, I/O and timing margins? Are they  adequate?  Need to ensure the design margins are meeting  the requirements defined by the design  organization.   Is the I/O standard and threshold level  consistent with the components shown in  the schematic?  Need to make sure that the signal levels  specified by the PLD are compatible with those  specified by the devices interfacing to the PLD.  For example, is a 5V CMOS output from the  PLD driving a device using 3.3V CMOS I/O?  This might work logically, but can create an  electrical stress condition to the device.                      How are the test cases organized? What  is the fidelity of the simulation models?  Is the test bench organization support  effective verification review?  The design of the test bench affects the  effectiveness of the verification effort. It uses  high fidelity simulation model supplied by  vendor when possible. Constraints of the  simulation models need to be noted in the  verification matrix. The organization of the  simulation tests need to support the  organization of the verification to facilitate the  verification review process.  Are there any complex algorithms in the  design? If so, how are they verified? Is  there any Matlab type simulation done  on the algorithm? If so, what has been  done to reconcile the Matlab simulation  results with the simulation results?  It is sometimes impossible to simulate complex  algorithm adequately in HDL simulation.  However, it is likely to achieve reasonable  confidence level of the design when comparing  the limited HDL simulation results with those  produced with Matlab or other modeling tool.  Are self-derived requirements from the  design specification covered in the  verification?  It is important to make sure that the  verification addresses the self-derived  requirements documented in the design  specification.  What is the maturity of the verification  matrix? Has the verification matrix been  reviewed?  The maturity of the verification matrix can  help gauge the maturity of the design.      What is the code coverage of the existing  simulation test bench?  Uncovered statement, toggle, transition, etc.  need to be dispositioned.                          Need to pay special attention to functions that  can only be tested in simulation.  Review Item  Are there any functions not testable in  hardware?   testability of these functions in  hardware?    Are all the test benches self-checking?  If not, what is done to make sure that the  test results are consistently verified?  Self-checking test benches makes sure that the  simulation results are consistently verified.  Visual inspection of the waveforms does not  always detect unexpected test results.                     Are internal probe points limited to 2  per tile?   Is embedded FIFO controller used in  the design?  Embedded FIFO controller is not used  because it is not rad-hardened in RTAX.   Are single-ended clock inputs only  assigned to the P-side of a P/N clock  input pair?  According toMicroSemi: \u201c\u2026when CLKBUF  (HCLKBUF) is used with a single-ended I/O  standard, it must be tied to the P-pad.\u2026of the  hardware clock (HCLK) package pin. In this  case, the HCLK N-pad can be used for user  signals.\u201d                          This appendix provides a framework to assist projects in the customization process.

The PLD design team considers these items when  creating the requirements and implementing the design. For example, in a safety-critical design,  the design team ensures that a requirement is in the form of: \u201cThe PLD device shall provide the  status of inhibits used to control hazards.\u201d This was taken from the first bullet/design  consideration.     \u2022 Hazardous Function Control. Computing systems provide hazardous function control  where the inadvertent activation, deactivation, or proper control by the function could  result in an identified critical or catastrophic hazard.  \u2022 Safe Initialization. Computing systems are initialized to a known, safe state. Circuitry  interfaced to the PLD takes into consideration the transient nature of inputs/outputs  during power-up/power-down conditions.      \u2022 Off-nominal Power. Safety-critical computing systems establish a safe or powered-  down state when self-monitoring functions detect off-nominal power conditions.       operational time predicted to cause a critical failure, following detection of predetermined  indications of incorrect or incomplete processing.               a. Demonstrate completeness of system state requirements including the following:  (1) Design starts in a known safe state. Interlocks are initialized or checked to be              A. Every state has a behavior (transition) defined for every possible input.  B. Every state has a behavior (transition) defined in case there is no input for a   (2) Non-determinism criterion - the behavior of the state machine is deterministic.  (3) Value and timing assumptions:        machine cancels the sequence automatically, returns to a safe state, and informs  the operator.                    rovide sufficient noise margin, adequate slew rate, and glitch filtering. Transient effects have  to be considered on the reset circuit. For the application of power, the output of the POR or reset  circuit is ideally a solid logic level and glitch-free. This requires the POR circuitry to be  designed using logic elements that operate correctly at the low ramping up voltages seen during  power up. This ensures that the POR signal is valid at the earliest time possible in the power-up-  down sequence of events. Inrush currents to timing capacitors are not to exceed the maximum  for that capacitor type. Rise times to logic gates, if used as a comparator, are not to exceed the  input's specifications. Gates with hysteresis inputs are often used for this purpose. Note that  even with that type of input, output glitches may occur and several stages of logic gates are not  to be used to dampen them. The most robust solutions often utilize a comparator with hysteresis.  worst cases. These often differ substantially from laboratory supplies and may be non-  monotonic or have substantial overshoot and ringing. Note that flight power supplies are often  slew-rate limited to minimize conducted emissions on the power bus. The time constant of the  supply may exceed that of the POR circuit.    the inputs of logic gates are protected. Most CMOS inputs, but not all, have ESD diodes from  the input to the supply rail. Discharging a large capacitance through that input may damage it.   power bus. While many circuits may recover or be recoverable from a power-on reset, this is not  true for all circuits. One such example is non-volatile, erasable memories, which need to be  carefully protected.    The topics in this appendix focus on considerations for the PCB design. They may serve as  discussions but are not necessarily applicable to the PLD design.                 For reset circuits, many implementations have \u201casynchronous application, synchronous removal\u201d  of the reset circuit. However, for many devices, in particular many programmable devices, the  inputs can be blocked or ignored during the power-on transient. This may be because of the need  for charge pumps to start or configurations to be loaded and then released. For devices with  synchronized inputs, the clock oscillators have to start, perhaps taking many tens of milliseconds  (ms), before the reset can be applied. Outputs of these devices are to be handled at the same  system level as the reset, which may appear to work on the schematic or in the HDL design files,  but is ignored by the real circuits. See figure 5, Recommended Power-On Reset Implementation,  that follows.   teady state or DC effects are also important. Check the leakage currents of timing capacitors  and logic gates, as the amount of leakage current times the resistance of the timing resistor may  result in a voltage drop that eliminates all noise margins.    time is sufficient for all circuits in the system in order to avoid premature release of the POR  signal, which may result in an indeterminate state. The following illustrates some factors to  consider when determining start-up time:     circuits having internal power-on reset circuits. The timing of all these resets have to be  analyzed for best- and worst-case behavior.                    . Components, such as PLDs and crystal clock oscillators, may have start-up times that  are a function of the rise time of the power supply. This behavior is often inadequately specified  or not specified at all.   the POR signal has to act as a gate (via external circuitry), blocking false signals during the  power supply rise time transient and then releasing after all circuits are stable. On the other side,  when the power comes down, the POR circuit may need to be asserted early, ensuring that  critical circuits are safe before the logic elements lose control as the voltage drops. Devices that  often need protection are pyrotechnic and explosive initiators, EEPROMs, flash memories, etc.  Note that some devices, such as microcontrollers, have internal flash memories; therefore, it is  recommended that the team evaluate all components and system interfaces for necessary  protection by the POR signals.        For every device, the design team carefully reviews the data sheet and design schematics to  determine whether each special pin is properly terminated. Termination of many of these special  pins cannot be verified by test.  nsure that each configuration pin is carefully checked against the latest data sheet. Some pins  have very high internal pull-up resistors that can be compromised by high-speed signals on the  board level. In addition, some configuration pins can naturally just happen to float to the desired  state with nominal operation observed. Beware of special pins, such as programming pins, that  are required to be terminated appropriately for flight.    to have properly terminated inputs. For normal CMOS devices, this is a requirement. Certain  programmable devices, such as FPGAs, often take care of unused pins via software, exploiting  the programmable nature of the microcircuit. However, the limitations for each pin have to be             thoroughly considered. For example, in MicroSemi SX and SX-S, clock inputs, such as HCLK  or the global routed clocks, do not have an output stage\u2014they are special purpose. They have to  be terminated by the user. Failure to do so can result in large unintended currents that could  cause device damage.  Depending on the device, the manufacturer may reserve pins labeled as \u201cN/C\u201d (no connect) for  internal purposes. Check each pin carefully according to the specification and clarify with the  manufacturer if necessary about the risk involved with terminating them on the board.   any devices have custom test interfaces that have to be handled on a case-by-case basis. Since  they hook up to test equipment, following the manufacturer's instructions is recommended. For  example, MicroSemi SX-S device test pins need to be series terminated.   f PLD I/O are used to implement a debug interface for development, make sure that the inputs  are safely terminated or driven and that outputs are not toggling in the final flight configuration,  causing unnecessary EMI and noise.     nsure that output signals are terminated properly. For single-ended signals, start by using  termination resistor values equal to the trace impedance minus the output impedance of the  driver (Rterm = Ztrace \u2013 Zdriver) then perform signal integrity analysis to optimize the termination  resistor values.    ensure that there is a smooth transition through the threshold. For loaded clocks, perhaps  traveling over long runs, reflections may often result in non-monotonic transitions causing false  or double clocking. Note that this may happen on the \u201cinactive\u201d edge. Similarly, overshoot and  ringing can also cause false clocking, particularly on the transition to ground. Unterminated nets  could result in ringing that is a source of EMI, even when they do not contribute to logic failures.  tight limits on how far outside the rail a signal may travel, sometimes coupled with maximum  time outside of the recommended limits.                required, adding them later could require additional time in layout, debugging, rework, and/or  costly board respin. Measurements can also be used to supplement this effort.   at specific values. Board designers can consider the source termination options of the FPGA,  and design traces accordingly. In addition, input terminations can be considered as well,  especially with Low Voltage Differential Signal (LVDS) terminations or double data rate (DDR)  interfaces.  . Be aware of part-specific default operation. For example, differential interfaces, such  as RS-422 and LVDS standards, require that receivers whose inputs are open, output a logic \u20181\u2019  to the system. Thus, systems need to be designed so that such a logic \u20181\u2019 state does not cause an  unintended lock up of the system.  a. Avoid contention when actively driving tri-state buses. Have a guaranteed off-time  between drivers on the bus in the worst-case. A clock cycle between tri-stating one driver and  enabling another may be sufficient but a thorough timing analysis is necessary. Be sure to  consider timing parameters that have to be added together. For example, the tri-state time of an  external SRAM\u2019s output enable that is controlled by a PLD\u2019s state machine would be the sum of  the time cut off out of the PLD + the travel time on the board + the SRAM\u2019s tri-state time.          . Be sure to consider the power up, reset, or the configuration cycle for the device to  make sure that outputs are not floating or contending. One method to mitigate contention is to  gate FPGA-sourced control signals with board-level POR using discrete CMOS logic gates to  disable tri-state drivers in all devices on the bus.                  t is important to examine input slew rate. Some high-speed devices have very stringent  restrictions on input transition times. Failure to meet the requirements may result in oscillations  (figure 6, Glitches Due to Input Slew Rate Violations), multiple clocking, degradation, or  damage.     may be too slow. Take appropriate precautions if older digital logic families are used that may  have outputs that are not compatible (e.g., too slow) with high-speed devices.   avoided since it may damage components if the switching speeds are not matched, and it can be  difficult or impractical to test this redundant topology. If this needs to be done, consider using  an external buffer or splitting the loads between two or more nets, each driven by a single output.   xamine voltage thresholds, DC compatibility, and noise margins. When mixing devices from  multiple families, even from the same manufacturer, care has to be taken to ensure the devices  are operated within specifications and there is sufficient noise margin. This may be problematic  when substituting parts for either upgrading circuit performance or dealing with obsolescence  issues.  For inputs, many CMOS technology devices advertise \u201ctransistor-transistor logic (TTL)  compatible\u201d inputs. However, these inputs may in fact differ rather significantly from their TTL  counterparts. The first major difference for many but not all devices is the impedance presented  to the interface when power is removed from the device. For example, when radiation-hardened  CMOS latches were substituted for soft 54LS373 latches in the Galileo attitude control            Another related difference is the maximum voltage that can be applied. Some bipolar devices  are useful for reliable level shifting from higher voltages to lower ones; CMOS replacement  devices will forward bias to the protection diodes resulting in unintended current flows and  possible damage or circuit failure. Finally, many CMOS inputs have logic thresholds that are not  truly TTL compatible. That is, the TTL voltage threshold for input high (VIH) specification is  often not met, with VIH (max) values of 2.2V, 2.4V, and sometimes 2.5V being specified  whereas true TTL devices have a threshold defined by two diode drops, typically in the range of  1.2V to 1.4V.  TL outputs are only guaranteed to drive to VOH = 2.4V so there may be little or even negative  noise margins present in these situations. The switching point difference can also lead to circuit  failure, depending on the signal integrity. Often TTL outputs, when switching, exhibit non-  monotonic-behavior in the waveform, particularly with heavy and/or long loads. While the  behavior is often at a high enough voltage so that TTL devices operate correctly, the often higher  VIH of CMOS devices may result in multiple clocking. Pull-up resistors can restore adequate  DC noise margins in these situations if given enough time to settle, which may be quite a while  for this passive circuit. Note, however, that TTL to CMOS clock interfaces designed in this  fashion often fail logically since the CMOS input may see multiple transitions resulting in double  clocking.   It is strongly recommended to check all specifications carefully. For example, many CMOS  devices when driving loads are specified at only very low current levels for high or logic \u20181\u2019  signals. However, TTL inputs take substantial currents and do not present the high impedance  seen by CMOS field effect transistor (FET) inputs and the output may be dragged down. For  output loads that are a mix of CMOS and TTL inputs, they often have to be split to guarantee the  high voltage needed for the CMOS inputs. This is typically 70 percent of VDD, and the high  current needed for TTL inputs, with the lower VIH of 2.0V. Another factor to consider is the  structure of the output stage in the CMOS device. For example, some devices will not swing all  the way to the high rail and are voltage limited. This may result in some totem-pole current if  the p-channel FET in the next input stage is not cut off. Some devices, even with a 5V I/O  supply like an RT54SX series, only drive outputs to the core voltage of 3.3V, making this CMOS  output incompatible with 5V CMOS inputs on the same board.  computer's memory units, block redundancy circuits failed since the sneak path through the  radiation-hardened inputs\u2019 ESD protection diodes was not accounted for when power was  removed.         Components currently have many supply voltages, including 1.5V, 1.8V, 2.5, 3.3V, and 5.0V.  There is also an abundance of I/O standards with the newest devices being programmable, so  their characteristics are not obvious or known from viewing a board schematic. Therefore, I/O  compatibility has to be carefully verified, particularly when substituting \u201cnew and improved\u201d  devices or alternate devices.   savings, care has to be taken when designing a system with blocks that are independently  powered. Many CMOS devices present low impedance when powered down through either the  intrinsic or the ESD protection diodes. Other devices, with cold sparing inputs, may have high  input impedance that is suitable for operation. For PLDs, selecting 3.3V PCI compatibility, as  one example, can result in a \u201ccold sparing\u201d device no longer being high impedance since a  clamping diode is enabled. While many bipolar devices are compatible with cold sparing  architectures, some devices have a sneak path to VCC through the output (figure 7, Sneak Path in  Some LSTTL from Output to VCC) . Be sure to consider test setup, not just the flight  configuration. For example, consider whether a piece of test equipment needs to be powered up  and down co-incidentally with the flight unit.               ollow device family datasheets to ensure proper power-up and -down sequencing. Power  sequencing requirements may differ between flight and prototype devices. Many of the newer  technology devices require two or more power supplies. Often these are divided into supplies to  power the core of a logic device and a second supply to operate the I/O cells. Additional  supplies may be needed for PLLs and DLLs, special I/O standards, or various bias supplies, such  as external charge pumps. The supplies have to meet all of the DC standards as well as ripple  characteristics, particularly for circuits such as PLLs. The sequence that power is supplied to a  single device in certain cases, can affect circuit behavior, performance, and reliability. For  certain devices, such as SX-S series devices, if the I/O supply is brought up before the logic core,  a large inrush current may be present; this would not be the case if the order of the supplies were  reversed. For certain devices, incorrect power sequencing can result in overstress or damage.  Often the requirements for sequencing are in application notes. When parts that require  sequencing are present, they need to be flagged, and the design has to incorporate circuit  protection, as required.  nalyze design for sneak paths between I/O that interfaces powered and unpowered devices.  The power supply sequencing between interfacing ICs, either on the same or separate boards, has  to be considered. Many ICs, particularly CMOS, present a low impedance to the system when  powered off. Most of these ICs require that the power supply be brought up prior to the  application of signals on either the inputs or the outputs (many PLD outputs also have inputs  active in the general purpose I/O modules). Some programmable ICs cannot be analyzed by  inspection of the schematic; the particular I/O configuration has to be reviewed. For instance,  some I/O modules provide for cold sparing; that is, they present high impedance to the system  when powered off. That same I/O, configured differently, may have clamp diodes switched in  while powered off for PCI compatibility. The design details are needed to do a worst-case  analysis.    meet PLD requirements. Startup current transients are common in many devices. The size of the  current can be a function of time between power cycles, temperature, ramp rate of the supply,  radiation exposure history, power supply sequencing, etc. These currents can be large for certain  devices, often as high as several amps. Ensure the power supply system does not limit current to  steady state levels because insufficient current during the startup sequence can result in a failure  to properly initialize, power device shutdown, recycling in an infinite loop, or a system lockup.  Similarly, some parts have restrictions on minimum and maximum power supply rise times.              ollow device datasheets and/or device application notes for proper decoupling. Perform a  power integrity analysis at the frequencies of operation. Logic devices can be rather large,  consisting of billions of gates. Synchronous design techniques, high operating frequencies, and  large I/O counts can result in a challenge to the power distribution and conditioning system.  Application notes contain most of the manufacturer\u2019s supply details. Follow these rules unless a  power integrity analysis and testing of the system for worst-case conditions reveal an alternate  course. Worst-case test patterns can be exploited to ensure high-fidelity power and then replaced  with the flight application. JTAG interfaces may also be used with care given that the JTAG test  patterns do not violate design limits, such as SSOs. Consider the aging effects of time and  radiation.       to complete a write access of non-volatile memories, if needed. In cases where non-volatile  memory protection is required, the PLD requirements specify the mitigations performed by the  PLD.   ndeterminate signals sourced from the PLD are a common problem for erasable non-volatile  memories. The analysis and test has to examine all of the signals for proper and safe operation  during power-up, power-down, and brown-out transients. Note that the real power supply and its  bounded characteristics has to be used, not laboratory supplies that most likely have substantially  different characteristics. Some devices have a reset pin to help protect against inadvertent writes.  The design, analysis, and test/evaluation of this circuit under all conditions are critical for  maintaining the integrity of the non-volatile memory contents. Consider circuit operation if the  power is shut down during either a planned or unexpected write cycle. The design needs to  ensure the proper completion of write cycles to protect the contents of the non-volatile memory.  The write cycle often includes the time for not only the bus operation to complete, but also for  writing to the internal part, which can take about 10 ms. Another related consideration is the  unexpected application of a system reset signal. Shutdown states are entered to help ensure that  write cycles are fully completed and properly shut down, with the critical signals put in a safe  mode.         mplement a mechanism to detect corrupted writes. The technology of the non-volatile memory  has to be carefully considered if the memory is to be written in flight. Some of these devices,  such as EEPROMs, use high voltage to write the cell. If struck by a heavy ion with high voltage  applied, the failure mode needs to be analyzed and dealt with appropriately. Thus, writing in  flight has to be considered a high-risk operation.    esign an interface to maximize useful life of memory. Many non-volatile erasable memories  have limited number of access cycles. Each device has to be treated on a case-by-case basis with  system lifetime and radiation factored in. For example, the 128k x 8 Hitachi die, for example,  has a lifetime write specification limit of 104 cycles in byte mode with 105 cycles in page mode.  The write mechanism for this device utilizes an 8-byte subpage as the smallest unit that can be  written. Therefore, writing the same memory space one byte at a time is more stressful than  page writes since entire subpages have to first be fetched and then re-written.   the signals interfacing with non-volatile memories be clean, that system noise be kept to a  minimum, and that they always meet all specifications. In this case, signals include not only  logic signals but also power and ground connections; therefore, robust bypassing needs to be  used. Noise glitches on EEPROMs, for example, can cause false write cycles to be generated,  resulting in inadvertent altering of the device\u2019s contents.   he required reliability of the non-volatile, erasable memory device is highly dependent on its  application. If the device operates as part of a large memory array, then some bit failures and  even page failures can be tolerated either by error correction techniques or by error detection and  mapping the failed segment out of service.  Another example is when the PLD is accessing memory. For single bit failures, a Hamming  code may suffice, although that may be awkward for serial PROMs. Some failure modes of non-  volatile memory devices may result in a bit oscillating or not providing a valid logic level; in this  case, an EDAC device may or may not correct the single bit error, depending on the logic design  of the EDAC device being used and whether or not it is static hazard free. In any event, the   esign interfaces to implement the required error detection and correction (EDAC). For  reprogrammable PLDs that are configured, it is a best practice to maintain a non-changeable  memory like programmable read-only memory (PROM) that can be switched on if the  configuration memory fails.          devices employed, combined with the architecture of the particular system, have to ensure that  there are no lockup states from any credible failures. Credible failures include any single bit  error and an inadvertent corruption of a non-permanent memory\u2019s contents.   options include the ability to switch in alternate devices, the use of permanent memory such as  PROM, or the use of storage buffers to replace erasable non-volatile memory functions, using  operational overhead to manage the risk. For example, if a configuration memory device for a  PLD fails, a storage buffer and CPU may configure the PLD using a different loading mode,  assuming that, of course, the PLD is not needed to run the computer. In general, for critical  applications, permanent memories, such as PROM, are to be used to ensure that the spacecraft or  other system cannot be permanently lost. This can take the form of boot and safe-hold code for a  processor or a basic operating configuration for a PLD.  retention against mission life. Another consideration is the guaranteed storage time of the device  versus mission length. Each device has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Ten years is a  frequent specification for the retention of memory contents; however, system lifetimes of several  decades is not uncommon.   Refreshing can be risky. The usefulness of it has to be verified with the manufacturer\u2019s  assistance, to ensure a guarantee of storage integrity, particularly in the radiation environment.  When the device is refreshed, it may be susceptible to damage in the space environment by  heavy ions. Other errors can occur that damage the contents, such as a computer crash, brown  out, or the unexpected removal of power due to a bus fault or a spacecraft entering a safe mode.  In addition, each write cycle takes away from the operational lifetime of the component.   f applicable to the design, consider the following board design activities to ensure adequate and  robust noise immunity:      devices are directly supporting differential standards. Additionally, high-speed, lower power  differential devices support standards, such as LVDS, are now qualified.                   to a valid logic \u20181\u2019 with sufficient noise immunity. Calculate worst-case currents and voltage  output versus worst-case input thresholds. Use level shifters as needed.       t is advisable to consider credible but unplanned events. Often many of these situations can be  economically handled with some planning. Following are a few sample activities to consider:   a. Perform limit and validity checking. The system needs to respond in a reasonable  fashion to unexpected input states. For data passed from one source to another, simple bounds  checks can detect and cause appropriate action for many off-nominal conditions, such as a  disconnected source. This may result in all Fs being returned on a data bus. For floating point  numbers, determine whether the input in a valid format. A minimum criterion is that any  credible input does not damage hardware and prevent recovery. Assume that the probability of  software failure is 100 percent.   wire breaks in a connector, for each wire. For power, use multiple wires such that if any one  wire breaks the remaining set can carry the load (and be sure to test this redundancy). For  signals, consider on-board terminations that pull floating signals into a safe and operational state.  This can also provide protection if the board or subsystem is powered with a connector not  hooked up, perhaps by test error. Avoid putting signals such as power and ground on adjacent  pins, as a short can take out the system.                      Follow manufacturer\u2019s recommendation for grounding the PLD lid. The lid may need grounding  to ensure that there is no buildup of charges. Doing this prevents ESD events.

However, any mission determines which of these are to be implemented in its specific radios to  support the mission\u2019s needs. In NASA-STD-4009A, requirements were written in a layered way  so as to describe many architectural requirements in terms of applications, devices, services,  other artifacts, and how they are used to perform the necessary functions.  he Level 1 requirements include responding to commands sent from an external source for  remote reconfiguration, remote reprogrammability, processor sharing, and commanded Built-In-  Test (BIT) and status reporting. These Level 1 requirements become part of the rationale for  those requirements in NASA-STD-4009A pertaining to the startup and configuration of the radio  as well as commanding the radio and obtaining information back about the configuration and  command success.    applications are executed. Because an STRS radio is really a computer, it has an operating  system (OS) usually created separately from the STRS infrastructure. Using an OS promotes the  STRS goals and objectives for flexibility, decreasing development time and cost, and increasing  the reliability of SDRs, by leveraging existing standards, resources, and experience. A real-time  operating system (RTOS) is likely to be used to meet timing deadlines and to support other  operations, even though most of the real-time capability currently resides in field programmable  gate arrays (FPGAs). Furthermore, an OS will need real-time capability if the general purpose  processors (GPPs) are faster and assume more of the telecommunication functions or if the      External Hardware Control.  5.6  Standard Spacecraft Interfaces.  5.7  5.8  Existing Waveform Support.  5.9 Multiple Waveform Support.  5.10 Simultaneous Operation of Multiple Waveforms.  5.11 Multi-Service Support.  5.12 Suitable for Any Radio Frequency Bands.  5.13 Multiple Frequency Bands  5.14 Multi-Channel Capability.  5.15 Commanded Built-In-Test and Status Reporting.  5.16 Operational Diagnostics.  5.17 Automated System Recovery/Initialization.  5.18 Navigation Support.  5.19 Network Support.  5.20 Security Compatibility.  5.21 Secure Transmission.  5.22 Processor Sharing.  5.23 Autonomous Link Optimization.      he Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae) is a standard that is used by many OSs.

ASA-STD-4009A requires specific information to be delivered with an STRS-compliant  platform and application. This information is requested to support the goals and objectives for  extensibility, adaptability, portability, reusability, and vendor independence. The specific  mission procuring the platform and/or application will require additional documentation to  integrate and operate the platform and/or application with the rest of the system for the mission.  example, the independence of the providers of the infrastructure and the FPGA. The basic goals  and objectives include accommodating advances in technology with minimal rework  (extensibility) and maintaining vendor independence. The STRS infrastructure has access to the  HAL, and the HAL is specific to a platform. Since STRS is designed for the applications to be as  portable as possible, STRS hides the HAL from the STRS application using a bridge pattern so  that an STRS application can use a standardized application program interface (API) to interact  with any specialized hardware.     ecause of size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions for space, many of the requirements in  the Department of Defense\u2019s Software Communications Architecture (SCA) version 2.2 were  eliminated for STRS. These include eliminating the requirement for Common Object Request  Broker Architecture (CORBA) and the onboard parsing of the Extensible Markup Language  (XML). Although object-oriented Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams were used for  parts of the description to clarify relationships, they did not become part of the requirements. As  described in the Case Study, STRS was able to use almost the same PIM as the OMG\u2019s  SWRADIO to come up with a very different implementation.   pure object-oriented approach was unsatisfactory. To encapsulate functionality in a consistent  manner, APIs were defined and the corresponding #include files were required to constrain the  method signatures appropriately. A subset of the infrastructure APIs was required to call the  appropriate application API. Because of the C language interface, the methods were  differentiated so that the STRS infrastructure APIs had a different naming convention and two  additional arguments:                to indicate who the responder or destination is. The STRS infrastructure uses the toWF to  determine which application, device, file, or queue is to be used to perform any further  processing. Then the infrastructure-provided method usually calls the corresponding  Application-provided method.  A handle ID is used to control access to applications, devices, and so forth. The fromWF and  toWF may be used by the infrastructure to validate whether the method is allowed to be called  and to keep track of the history of the method call for error processing. They are used by the  infrastructure when creating log messages to indicate the source of an error.  t is up to the infrastructure provider whether the handle ID is an index into a table, or an address  of a structure, or a hash value used to look up the information that the infrastructure uses to  access the application, device, file, or queue. The only restriction imposed by STRS is that a  negative value indicates an error. It is the responsibility of the infrastructure to keep any  additional information needed to intelligently populate the error logs. Each application is  informed of its own handle ID and handle name using APP_Instance. The application uses its  own handle ID as the fromWF argument to most STRS infrastructure-provided methods. There  should be a handle ID for the infrastructure (or portions thereof) to indicate when the  infrastructure is the source for error messages.   needed to be APIs to standardize additional portions of the software. Therefore, APIs were  created for devices, message queues, files, and timing. Some others were left to POSIX\u00ae to  implement.    onfiguration files or script files are recommended as a self-documenting way for the STRS  infrastructure to start STRS applications into a known state to support the Level 1 requirements  for remote partial configuration, reconfigurability, adaptability, automated system recovery and  initialization, and multiple waveform support. The basic requirement derives from the need for  each component to start in a known state. Requirement STRS-1 produces a known state for the  platform. Using application configuration files or script files produces a known state for the  applications. The infrastructure configuration files are suggested to allow for evolution of the  hardware and software in a standard way.   needed by the application, what variables need to be defined, and what state changes need to be  made. There is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between an application and a  loadable file. A loadable file can contain parts of multiple applications; likewise, an application  can span multiple loadable images. In a common case, a single application has both a GPP part  and an FPGA part. Another case occurs for the OS-like Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor  Systems (RTEMS), a free open-source RTOS designed for embedded systems, which does not  support dynamic loading. In that case, there is no need to include separate information on the         The application configuration files allow for the same application to be configured for different  situations. For example, the environment may vary over the life of the radio and parameters may  need to be adjusted accordingly. Another example might be allowing the original frequencies  defined in a configuration file to be updated to avoid interference. It is less risky to send a short  data file to the radio than to send a full software load. A current example for one of the SCaN  Testbed SDRs is that the software and/or configurable hardware design has to remain stable at a  certain point in the development process so that code review and test can be completed.  However, there are parameters that are environmentally sensitive and can only be determined by  testing under environmental conditions that simulate the conditions of space. These parameters  are determined and entered into the application configuration file. A new application  configuration file is then added to the SDR, but the software and configurable hardware design  used for the code review and test remain unchanged.   can be specified in a configuration file or script so that any reinitialization is predictable. For  example, if the radio needs to cycle power to correct some glitch, it should be able to do so and  restart the application without intervention. The project manager may require the inclusion of  \u201cinitial or default values for all distinct operationally configurable parameters.\u201d The  \u201coperationally configurable parameters\u201d were those that could be configured using the  STRS_Configure/APP_Configure commands instead of using subordinate parameters that do not  have to be configured separately or using merely queryable parameters. For example, if a data  item can be initialized in multiple ways such as having parameters for both frequency and  wavelength, only one would need to be configured. Also, a parameter could be queryable but not  configurable (e.g., temperature, location, and power consumption).   as a good starting point. The reasons for using XML for the predeployed application  configuration files are as follows:  GPP part of an application, since the build process does not make a loadable image for the  application alone, separate from the infrastructure.          infrastructure for each vendor may need different information to start an application. The data in  the application configuration files may not always be just name/value pairs.            f. Using XML allows for hierarchical as well as sequential data. Using hierarchical data  allows for greater complexity. Using XML does not hinder the data from being used sequentially  or in a specific order.   appears in the deployed configuration file. The minimum data could be identification, any  resources loaded, any parameters configured, and ending state information.   meet some specified criteria so that the creation of the deployed configuration file will work  properly.  i. STRS began as an approach to adapt SCA for NASA space applications. A waveform  application was implemented using SCA and from that, it was apparent that having CORBA and  an XML parser in the radio added quite a lot to the complexity, size, and weight. STRS  eliminated the need for CORBA, dynamic features, and an XML parser in the OE. So, the best  resolution was having XML to start with and a processed file to deploy on the radio.   An Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation (XSLT) could be written to transform an  SCA properties file into any deployed format.  k. Using XML allows validation of input values. Part of the compliance testing is to  verify that the configuration file follows the format specified in the schema. Using an XML  schema saves NASA from having to keep a different validation tool for each vendor.   are more easily validated and changed. The minimum was specified for the format of the  application configuration files so that each vendor could use the format appropriate to that  vendor\u2019s implementation. For example, here are some alternatives for a \u201cwait\u201d command in  XML:  (1) <command>wait 100</command>  (2) <wait>100</wait>  (3) <wait delay=\u201d100\u201d/>  (4) <wait delay=\u201d100\u201d units=\u201dmicroseconds\u201d/>  (5) <wait> <delay>100</delay> <units>microseconds</units> </wait>  Validation is difficult for alternative (1) using a schema. When the data \u201c100\u201d is  separately identified, as in alternatives (2)-(5), it is easier to validate using a schema.  When \u201c100\u201d is labeled as a delay, it is easier for multiple entities to identify and  modify. Alternative (3) is not really better than (2) because the word delay does not  add to the definition of the number significantly but adding the units does. When the  \u201c100\u201d is labeled as a delay in microseconds, as in alternatives (4)-(5), it is even easier  for multiple entities to identify and modify. Both (4) and (5) contain the same  explanatory information and may be clearly checked by a schema. Which one may be          considered optimal depends on the ability to transform the data into a deployed  format.  XML 1.0 is recommended because the http://www.w3.org/ standards state that even though  XML 1.1 is the current version, \u201cYou are encouraged to create or generate XML 1.0 documents  if you do not need the new features in XML 1.1.\u201d Furthermore, an error was obtained when using  XMLSpy, a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software product for testing with XML 1.1.   configuration files to be preprocessed into a simpler form. Although XSLT is suggested in  NASA-STD-4009A as a simple mechanism for this transformation, it is not required.  Alternatively, the preprocessing could be handled by a program or script. Although a manual  process using a text editor is not impossible, an automated process is preferred.   that an STRS application can have various states during execution. The files for the STRS  application are to be accessible before execution can begin.   APP_Instance or the constructor to be called such that the STRS application starts in  the INSTANTIATED state, but it may be transitioned to another state if specified in  the STRS application configuration file.                                       \u2022 The FAULT state may be set by the STRS application or detected by the fault  monitoring and recovery functions, but any recovery is managed by the STRS  infrastructure or by an external system.  he STRS application internal states shown in figure 1 are suggested. The STRS application  developer may define and use any additional internal states that the STRS application developer  sees fit. The infrastructure may use any additional states that are deemed necessary.   or STRS, roles are specified as abstractions for the responsible organizations. The roles and  corresponding organizations are expected to change at different stages of the radio\u2019s life cycle.  For example, a developer or provider of some component may act as an STRS integrator for that  component and other components at a subsequent stage of production. Then, that STRS  integrator may act as a provider for the next stage. NASA\u2019s goals are to promote vendor  independence, scalability, flexibility, and extensibility while specifying the smallest number of  clearly defined roles possible.                 The basic roles that NASA-STD-4009A defines are the STRS platform provider, who delivers a  platform upon which STRS applications can be executed, an STRS application developer who  provides the desired functionality in the form of an STRS application, and an STRS integrator  who is responsible for integrating the parts to work together. The STRS platform provider could  subcontract for hardware and software, but the responsibility for coordination, integration, and  delivery of the infrastructure and related artifacts would reside in one STRS platform provider  organization.  The STRS platform provider would usually act as STRS application developer and STRS  integrator for at least a sample application. The roles and associated products are depicted in  figure 2, Roles and Products.  he roles could have been broken down differently, allowing for various combinations of  providers and integrators that could be very complex. Some suggested roles were as follows:  a. Application developer or provider.  b. Application integrator (OE + applications).  c. Configurable hardware design provider.  d. HAL/board support package (BSP)/drivers provider.  e. Hardware integrator.  f. Hardware parts supplier.  g. Infrastructure provider.  h. Kernel integrator (OS + POSIX\u00ae + HAL).  i. OE integrator (OS + POSIX\u00ae + HAL + infrastructure).  j. OE provider (OS + POSIX\u00ae + HAL + infrastructure).  k. Operator.  l. OS provider.  m. Platform integrator.  n. Platform provider.  o. POSIX\u00ae provider.  p. Radio integrator (OE + applications).  q. Radio operator (concerned with the mechanics of commanding the radio).  r. Spacecraft operator (concerned with the functionality of the radio in the larger sense  of including ground operations, experimenters, i.e., consumers of the data flowing through the  radio).   Some of these roles are duplicates or overlap one another. There were multiple interpretations for  some of the roles, causing confusion. Therefore, the roles were simplified. Although a few  operator roles were suggested, the operator roles have no STRS requirements, so these roles were  not included. The operator roles are required for specific missions or projects rather than for the  STRS architecture. There are no STRS requirements for specific external commands and how the  commands and data get to the STRS radio. There are no STRS requirements for a specific  process for an operator to turn the radio on and off, send configuration commands, consume and  source data, deal with configuration management of software uploads, and other functions. There  are no STRS requirements for the radio link parameters and for the actions of the experimenters             and consumers of the data flowing through the radio. These types of requirements are mission-  specific and have to be included in the requirements for the particular mission or project, which  are in addition to NASA-STD-4009A requirements.   concerning the process by which the documents are generated. There will be mission or project  requirements for additional roles (including stakeholders) not mentioned here, for which STRS  has no requirements.                      and transfer data. The handle name of the STRS Device for each FPGA may be named  differently, especially on different platforms. To make it easy for the STRS application to access  the appropriate FPGA with maximum portability, the handle name of the STRS Device that  corresponds to the appropriate FPGA should be a configurable attribute for the STRS  application. The STRS application would use the attribute supplying the handle name to obtain  the handle ID using STRS_HandleRequest. The application would use the resulting handle ID of  the STRS Device to invoke the STRS Infrastructure-Provided Application Control API methods  (NASA-STD-4009A, section 7.3.2) and STRS Infrastructure-Provided Device Control API  methods (NASA-STD-4009A, section 7.3.6) to interact with the FPGA. A likely implementation  would have any methods in the STRS Infrastructure-Provided Device Control API invoke the  corresponding method in an STRS Device-Provided Device Control API. A sample of an STRS  Device-provided Device Control API is shown in Figure 5, STRS Application/Device Structure,  as the Device API.     file for WF1 could contain a name/value pair to associate the name useFPGA with FPGA2. Let  the function getValue obtain the value corresponding to the given name. Then, the STRS  application could access the correct FPGA, as follows:  STRS_HandleID fromID = APP_GetHandleID();  char* fpgaName = getValue(\u201cuseFPGA\u201d);  STRS_HandleID fpgaID = STRS_HandleRequest(fromID, fpgaName);  STRS_Result rtn = STRS_ValidateHandleID(fpgaID);  If ( ! STRS_IsOK( rtn )) {  STRS_Message msg = \u201cHandle ID error for useFPGA.\u201d;  STRS_HandleID errQ = STRS_GetErrorQueue(rtn);  STRS_Log (fromID, errQ, msg, (STRS_Buffer_Size) sizeof(msg));  n FPGA may be loaded directly by the infrastructure when it parses the configuration file, if  supported, or may be loaded by an STRS_DeviceLoad call from the application GPP code. If the  latter method is used, the name of the bitstream file should also be a configurable attribute set  with the APP_Configure method. The STRS_HandleRequest method should be called to obtain  the handle ID for the FPGA Device, and then the STRS_DeviceLoad method should be called  for the FPGA to load the bitstream file. These STRS infrastructure calls may be performed in the  APP_Configure directly or in the APP_Start method, as appropriate.               n FPGA may be configured directly by the infrastructure when it parses the configuration file  or by an STRS_Configure call to the STRS Device for the FPGA call from the application GPP  code. If the latter method is used, the handle name of the FPGA Device should also be a  configurable attribute set with the APP_Configure method. The STRS_HandleRequest method  should be called to obtain the handle ID for the FPGA Device, and then the STRS_Configure  method should be called for the FPGA Device to configure the FPGA. These STRS  infrastructure calls may be performed in the APP_Configure directly or in the APP_Start  method, as appropriate.    ot all specialized hardware can be interrogated for its configuration; however, the infrastructure  or the application may maintain any configuration data needed. The application has to implement  APP_Query and, if appropriate, it should call the STRS_HandleRequest to obtain the handle ID  for the FPGA followed by an STRS_Query call to the STRS FPGA Device to obtain the  configuration data from the FPGA.  STRS_Write is used. For generating packets in the same application used to send the packets,  APP_Write may be used directly. If an application acts as a sink of packets pushed, it has to  implement APP_Write, #include \"STRS_Sink.h\"; and if C++, the class has to implement  STRS_Sink.     packets from another module in the same application, APP_Read may be used directly. If an  application acts as a source of packets pulled, it has to implement APP_Read, #include  \"STRS_Source.h\", and, if C++, the class has to implement STRS_Source.   hen a call to an STRS method is made, a variable of type STRS_Result is usually returned. To  ensure consistent testing for errors, where an error is usually a negative value, STRS_IsOK tests  that variable of type STRS_Result for errors, and returns a true or false boolean variable. The  value returned from STRS_IsOK is true when there is no error and false when there is an error so  that appropriate action may be taken.   using an error queue handle ID (STRS_FATAL_QUEUE, STRS_ERROR_QUEUE, or  STRS_WARNING_QUEUE), and a descriptive message. The error queue handle ID can be          he STRS methods use the error returns rather than using variable errno to indicate an error.  STRS policy on errno is that it is undefined outside of the application methods. You cannot rely  on it to indicate the particular error because it is not reset before system calls and may be reset to  a different error later, before it is tested. It reduces portability by allowing different values on  different operating systems with different compilers.  determined using STRS_GetErrorQueue with the error return value as an argument. The error  queues are monitored and passed to the infrastructure for further action.    pertinent data are configurable. Two configuration or script files may have to be created, if any  of the initial data is different. A different handle name is specified for each instance. When using  C language applications, there may be method name duplication, which is discussed further in  section 6.10, C Language Naming Duplication.  TRS Devices are allowed to use memory mapped locations in which storing/retrieving an item  in shared memory automatically pushes/pulls the item to/from the specialized hardware. STRS  Devices do not have to be portable, so non-standard methods may be encapsulated within an  STRS Device. The STRS applications should not use the shared memory locations directly to  communicate with the specialized hardware because that is not portable and violates the spirit of  STRS. The addresses for the specialized hardware should not be defined in the application or its  configuration file. Hard-coding of memory locations in an STRS application or STRS Device is  strongly discouraged because hard-coding would limit the independence of the software and  configurable hardware design and may cause problems with verification and validation if any  FPGA code is changed that would affect that location.  here is no requirement that an STRS Device use configuration or script files containing location  information, but it is strongly encouraged to be configured rather than hard-coded. Configuration  data are usually specified in a configuration file where the OE parses the configuration file to call  STRS_Configure and that calls APP_Configure in the STRS Device to accept the configuration  data. However, there is nothing in the standard that restricts the OE from calling other method(s)  such as DEV_SetMemoryMap(map) to specify more complicated configuration data. Similarly, a  script file may be executed to call STRS_Configure and related commands.  he shared memory locations should be specified in the configuration or script files for the  appropriate STRS Device. In the example of a configuration file shown in Appendix A for  MEMORYMAP and MAPVALUE, there is a base name, associated relative location, offset,  size, and access. These are illustrated in figure 3, Memory Map. The location for an individual  item is specified relative to the base name in addressable storage units. The location may also  have a bit offset and bit length. Then, when the configurable item is modified, the mapped           location is used. In the example of an STRS Device shown in Figure 5, the OE can use the  DEV_SetMemoryMap(map) method to configure the mapping in the STRS Device.    except that STRS_Log adds a time stamp and possibly other identifying information. These  methods should never be mixed for a given target. An STRS application developer should only  write to the error queues using STRS_Log because the errors need to be identified further  (STRS-54, STRS-55, STRS-56) and never with STRS_Write. Similarly, an STRS application  developer should only write to the telemetry queues using STRS_Log because the telemetry data  need to be identified further (STRS-57) and never using STRS_Write. Furthermore, the error  queues are monitored for faults. An STRS application developer should only use STRS_Write to  write buffered data to another application, service, device, file, or queue that does not require  additional information added.    run test is invoked using STRS_RunTest and implemented by APP_RunTest. A ground test is  invoked using STRS_GroundTest and implemented by APP_GroundTest. A run test is invoked  before or after deployment to determine whether the component is performing correctly. A  ground test is generally invoked before deployment to perform unit testing and calibration. The  ground tests help to automate and evaluate those tests. The term ground test was originally used  to indicate testing for a satellite system, which is performed on the ground before launch.                 Ground test may be invalid after deployment and indicates that such tests are normally  completed before deployment and are not repeated thereafter. If allowed by the project and the  ground tests will not be repeated after deployment, then the ground test code may be removed  prior to deployment. The run tests and ground tests were separated because NASA generally  requires significant testing prior to deployment; for example, vibration testing, environmental  testing, radiation testing, etc.    STD-4009A along with the reverse commands, STRS_Stop, STRS_DeviceUnload, and  STRS_DeviceClose. The following describes the interaction of these commands under various  common circumstances.  nitialize (STRS_Initialize) is used while the application is in the STOPPED mode to set the  application to a known initial condition. The application may be configured before and/or after  initialize. Start (STRS_Start) is used to begin normal processing and change the state to  RUNNING. If any part of the application is in specialized hardware, that portion needs to be  loaded before starting. To load (STRS_Load) an STRS Device, the Device has to be opened  (STRS_Open) first. It is suggested that any part executing in specialized hardware not begin  execution upon being loaded but rather during the start process. Similarly, it is suggested that  stopping execution (STRS_Stop) does not require any specialized hardware to be unloaded.  Therefore, greater control is given to the application software for processing commands to start  and stop waveform application operation in order to take advantage of windows of opportunity  for execution as well as to promote consistency in control of the radio. Only certain allowed  items may be configured after starting.  t is suggested that the STRS OE use configuration file(s) to start-up an application to a known  initial state. STRS encourages that changeable data be specified in configuration files, rather than  coding the data as constants within the application or device, so that greater portability and ease  of modification is achieved. The STRS OE may process a configuration file to instantiate, open  and load the device, initialize, configure, and start the application, or use any subset of these as  determined by the project/mission and STRS platform provider.  As an example, the following use case is written for a waveform application using specialized  hardware to send signals over the air to another radio assuming that the specialized hardware  device has already been instantiated and initialized by the OE:  1. Radio receives a command that a new waveform application is needed. This may be  multiple commands received or one command that invokes a series of operations. In  either case, those operations follow.  2. OE checks for availability of the application and memory to instantiate it.  3. OE instantiates application (STRS_InstantiateApp).  4. OE initializes application (STRS_Initialize).  5. OE opens specialized hardware device (STRS_DeviceOpen).              commands received or one command that invokes a series of operations. In either case,  those operations follow.  2. OE stops the application (STRS_Stop).  3. OE unloads the specialized hardware device (STRS_DeviceUnload).  4. OE closes the specialized hardware device (STRS_DeviceClose).  5. OE releases resources for application (STRS_ReleaseResources).  If there is no specialized hardware device, the steps pertaining to such a device may be  eliminated. If the application merely performs calculation, start may mean perform the  calculation and, before each calculation, the data is reconfigured. Alternately, start may mean  ready to perform the calculation and start invokes a thread that loops waiting for new data so that  each time new data is obtained, the computation is performed. Similarly, for a waveform  application, start may mean to tell the specialized hardware device to begin processing signals or  alternately, start may invoke a thread to perform the communication functions. A separate thread  is used so that other commands may be processed independently.  description of content, format, and usage of buffers is provided as part of the user  documentation. As Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) Electronic Data  Sheets mature, these should be considered as precise machine-readable descriptions to facilitate  reading and writing data. Currently, CCSDS Electronic Data Sheets are Red Book specifications  876.0 and 876.1.   t is suggested that CCSDS be used to document the format of buffers. CCSDS book 876.0  specifies \"Electronic Data Sheets\" (EDS), which is an XML schema for describing data  exchange between system components. It provides a means to specify the exact format of the  data, binary or otherwise, the types of interfaces provided by a component, as well as any  handshaking or protocol-level requirements of an interface. The objective is to specify these  details in a machine-readable language, and with sufficient detail such that it eliminates the need  for a separate interface control document (ICD). The system components described can be  physical hardware devices, where the device manufacturer would author the EDS, or software  components where EDS can serve as a common interface description between the sender and  receiver.    6. OE loads specialized hardware device (STRS_DeviceLoad).  7. OE configures application (STRS_Configure).  8. OE starts application (STRS_Start).               The STRS architecture does not dictate a specific data format for all APIs, leaving this decision  up to application/waveform developers. By standardizing the description of the data format using  EDS, flexibility is retained while still providing a compatibility point. Because the electronic  data sheets are implemented in a machine-readable format, parts of the data exchange between  components can be machine assisted, thereby easing the efforts required to port applications  between different systems. Using the EDS, any other independently developed system or  component that also implements the CCSDS electronic data sheet technology can exchange data  with the component.  The core Flight System (cFS) is a platform independent reusable software framework and set of  reusable software applications that is reused on NASA flight projects and/or embedded software  systems at a significant cost savings. The cFS contains an implementation of the CCSDS  electronic data sheets. The cFS-based STRS OE utilizes this technology to describe the sink and  source interfaces as well as the various configurable properties of STRS applications, which aids  portability to other cFS installations or other independently developed systems implementing  EDS.   A queue can be used to disassociate a publisher directly from a subscriber. The Pub/Sub  implementation is synchronous. To get the asynchronous publisher/subscriber effect, the  publisher writes to a queue and, in a different thread, a copy service reads from the queue and  writes the data to a Pub/Sub to which the subscriber has registered. The copy service is to be  configured knowing a queue source, a Pub/Sub sink, and the maximum number of bytes.  Functionally, the copy service merely obtains the source and sink handle IDs and uses them to  read from the source and write to the sink.  A copy service may be useful to copy other sources to other sinks. It may need additional options  to do so, especially concerning initialization, finalization, and timing considerations. These will  have to be handled on a case-by-case basis.  he following questions have been asked by implementers of STRS-compliant platforms and  applications and are included to provide additional insight for readers who might have similar  questions.    ASA-STD-4009A does not specify how the fault state is set or detected. The fault state may be  determined in a number of ways as specified by the mission or project. When STRS_Log sends a  message to the error queue or fatal queue, it is assumed that there is an error or fatal error in that  component and that the fault state is set accordingly. The fault state could also be set when a  Health Manager or Watchdog Timer detects a problem (neither of which is required). The fault  state could also be detected when the telemetry returns improper values. The fault state as shown           in the state diagram (figure 1) implies that the radio detects and possibly recovers; however, it  could be designed so that the fault state is kept by the flight computer or equivalent.    a. The STRS_FATAL_QUEUE is the queue used when an STRS_FATAL error is  encountered. STRS_FATAL_QUEUE denotes the queue for a unrecoverable error in an attempt  to capture information about the situation in a logging trail used to reconstruct the original cause  of the error. Furthermore, sending a message to the STRS_FATAL_QUEUE is one way of  initiating an orderly shutdown and reboot of the radio to a known state. The processing for a fatal  error could imply turning off the heartbeat; that is, rebooting the radio and, if that does not work,  reloading the software and/or configurable hardware design. It could imply that additional  diagnostic tests need to be run. It is up to the mission to define whether there are alternative ways  of rebooting under different circumstances such as after trying three times. It may make a  difference if the problem is overheating or if a bit has been changed in the radio so that it does  not work properly.   b. STRS_ERROR_QUEUE denotes the queue for a recoverable error. The most likely  reason is an invalid set of configuration parameters. The recovery would be to get a valid set of  configuration parameters.  or no effect on the operation of the radio. The most likely reasons are trying to run a test in a  state for which the test is not allowed, trying to configure or query a parameter when the value is  not available in that state, or trying to run APP_Start when the application is already started.    n NASA-STD-4009A, a Pub/Sub is distinguished from a message queue. In a Pub/Sub,  messages written to the message passing facility by one application are delivered to all  subscribers of that publisher. The STRS does not require implementing Pub/Sub using the  observer/publish-subscribe design pattern where the class inherits a notify method. The STRS is  designed to work in C without inheritance, but the idea is that the publisher does not know the  identity of the subscriber such that one or more applications or devices can funnel data to one or  more different applications, devices, files, or queues. Figure 4, Sample Publisher-Subscriber  Sequence Diagram, is just one possibility for a sequence diagram showing the creation and  possible use of a messaging queue using one form of the publisher-subscriber paradigm.               etecting circularity and duplication is difficult with just the sequence diagram shown without  adding additional methods. Circularity is where the message published eventually ends up back  at the original publisher and is sent again in an infinite loop. Duplication is where the message  published ends up at the same destination twice.            There is a problem of notification when it is a message queue. STRS_Write will put the message  on the queue, but there is no standard way of determining when there is something waiting on the  queue; that is, when does STRS_Read obtain it from the queue and when does the message get  deleted from the queue? Also, can the queue fill up so that further messages are rejected? The  resolution to the message-queuing behavior is not included in the current version of NASA-STD-  4009A but has to be covered by the specific design for the mission or project.   n STRS Device is software that responds to both STRS Infrastructure-provided Application  Control methods and STRS Infrastructure Device Control methods. An STRS Device is used to  separate an abstraction in the form of its interface from its underlying implementation. An STRS  Device is a bridge between a waveform application and the specialized hardware, used to  insulate the waveform application developer from knowing how the data gets to its final  destination. This encourages encapsulation of non-portable functionality. STRS Devices do not  have to be portable. However, it will be advantageous to follow the STRS Device-Provided  Device Control API wherever possible to maximize consistency and portability. The  functionality of the STRS Device will need to be ported to each successive radio while allowing  an application to access the STRS Device methods in a consistent way that makes the STRS  applications more portable and more understandable.  f a waveform application intends to transfer a data value from/to the specialized hardware, the  waveform application would contain the data value and the corresponding STRS Device would  be used to transfer the data value from/to the specific location in the specialized hardware. The  STRS Device could use memory mapping or POSIX\u00ae or HAL, whichever is the documented  way to get/set data in the specialized hardware while keeping the waveform application portable.  n STRS application is expected to use an STRS Device method to transfer data to and from the  physical device. It was expected that the STRS Device configure/query methods could be used to  get or set values, but there was a complaint that there were problems with performance, porting  from legacy applications, and scheduling. Any exceptions to the standard are handled  individually.   An STRS_Write/APP_Write is used to send data to a buffer in the specialized hardware. As an  alternative, the STRS Device's APP_Configure could be used.  . An STRS Device can act as a source by implementing APP_Read in the STRS  Device. An STRS_Read/APP_Read is used to retrieve data from a buffer in the specialized  hardware. As an alternative, the STRS Device's APP_Query could be used.                   hen an FPGA is implemented as an STRS Device, the FPGA may be loaded, configured,  started, stopped, unloaded, and so forth, using the corresponding STRS Infrastructure Device  Control API. There is no requirement that an STRS Device actually exists as separate software or  hardware item. There is no requirement that the Device API is implemented as shown in figure 5.  They are required when portability and reusability are desired as measured by their inclusion into  the STRS Application Repository.  any SDRs use memory mapped locations in which storing/retrieving an item in memory  automatically pushes/pulls the item to/from the specialized hardware (see section 5.9). Other  SDRs use special APIs that comprise the HAL to send/retrieve the item to/from a specific  address in the specialized hardware. Still others use POSIX\u00ae. Having the STRS Device as a  portable interface for data transfer allows the HAL methods, POSIX\u00ae methods, or memory  mapping to be used as appropriate and easily changed. The STRS application can use the  appropriate STRS Device methods when the STRS application just knows the handle name of  the STRS Device, which gives more flexibility in configuring a data source or sink. For example,  an application might be used to transmit data over the air obtained from a data source that might  be configured as an application, device, queue, or file. Similarly, an application might be used to  receive data over the air and send it to a data sink that might be configured as an application,  device, queue, or file. Thus, an STRS Device may be used either to distribute functionality over  multiple waveform applications or to abstract hardware functionality, further giving greater  flexibility. This is analogous to redirection or pipes in UNIX\u00ae.  ince STRS Devices are only partially standardized by the STRS Device-provided Device  Control API, extra methods may be implemented in an STRS Device to be used by the OE to  establish the proper use of the HAL. A DEV_SetMemoryMap method is suggested in figure 5 to  specify how a named value is associated with the appropriate location in the specialized  hardware. This may be a non-portable construction but it does not violate the NASA Technical  Standard. The idea is to have the STRS application code as portable as possible with the STRS  Devices as lean as possible.            that is, which software component knows how to configure and control SDR hardware? A  combination of software components (waveform application, STRS infrastructure, STRS Device,  and HAL) knows how to configure and control SDR hardware.                            floating point to integer in a format that is recognized by the STRS Device, and  calls the appropriate method to configure the STRS Device.         (1) The STRS infrastructure reads the configuration files or receives an external  command and calls the STRS_Configure method for the appropriate target  component.      he STRS infrastructure-provided methods beginning with \u201cSTRS_\u201d do not belong to any class,  since they have to be the same when called from C language implementations. If one is coding in  C++, these methods should be defined using extern \"C\" {...}.    In NASA-STD-4009A, the STRS infrastructure provides the STRS infrastructure-provided  Application Control API that supports application operation using the STRS  Application-provided Application Control API in section 7.3.1. The STRS Infrastructure-  provided Application Control API methods (section 7.3.2) that begin with \u201cSTRS_\u201d correspond  to the STRS Application-provided Application Control API methods (section 7.3.1) that begin  with \u201cAPP_\u201d and are used to access those methods. The STRS infrastructure implements these                              methods for use by any STRS application or by any part of the infrastructure that is desired to be  implemented in a portable way.     and coordinating internal and external events, including timestamps for messages. As computer  speeds increase, more real-time functions for communication may be performed in the GPP.  Some functions currently in the FPGA(s) may be transitioned to the GPP when the GPPs are fast  enough and capable enough to handle the additional signal processing functionality. These GPP  functions would need access to high speed clocks/timers.  NASA-STD-4009A is designed to allow a clock/timer to be an extension of an STRS Device so  that the functionality can be embedded in specialized hardware, if necessary. Multiple timers are  only defined when they are required by the mission. An offset is usually specified to ensure that  the clock is monotonically increasing from a previous power reset or is synchronized with  another clock/timer.  ormally, each clock/timer has a base time, usually measured from when it is turned on. An  offset may be used to keep the time monotonically increasing with each power cycle. An offset  may also be used to coordinate with external events. The timing of external events, such as  another satellite coming over the horizon or the availability of experimenters, may be used to  power parts of the radio off and on so that the radio optimizes its power consumption and  availability.  t is recommended that one clock/timer match the required timestamp for STRS_Log so that an  application, service, the OE, or even STRS_Log itself could obtain that time in a consistent way.  It was suggested that the time for the timestamp be retrieved via STRS_GetTime using the  handle ID corresponding to handle name \"STRS_DEFAULT_CLOCK_NAME\" and kind given  by property \"STRS_DEFAULT_CLOCK_KIND\". The use of this handle ID for STRS_SetTime  may be restricted as necessary.  s specified by the mission, there should be at least one clock/timer with an epoch fixed to some  Earth time zone, e.g., Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), so that the epoch could be adjusted to  seconds from 1/1/1970 0:0:0, known adjustments for leap days and leap seconds applied, and the  standard POSIX\u00ae time functions used. For example:   object, apply any offset needed, and use gmtime_r to convert a given time since epoch (a time_t  value) into calendar time, expressed in UTC in the struct tm format.                 artial reconfiguration is the process of configuring selected areas of an FPGA after its initial  configuration. Xilinx indicates that a bitstream file can contain all the configuration commands  and data necessary for partial reconfiguration. Therefore, STRS_DeviceLoad will work, and no  new methods need to be defined. Whether the partial reconfiguration is fully transparent to the  application(s) running on the FPGA or requires stopping and restarting or reconfiguring any  other application(s) depends on the specifics of the partial reconfiguration.      TRS compliance of a vendor- or partner-provided SDR is assessed by source code inspection,  document inspection, configuration file inspection, adding an application containing a reference  to each STRS infrastructure method and testing that application. The name of that application is  the STRS Command and Compliance, also known as WFCCN. WFCCN may be compiled with  an STRS infrastructure to determine whether or not there are any missing constants, typedefs, or  structs. These techniques are described in the STRS Compliance Testing document, which  should be reviewed because of their complexity.   test them fully. Since STRS is designed to allow multiple vendors to work together, certain  source code artifacts have to be made available so that a subsequent STRS application developer  or STRS integrator can use the methods, constants, typedefs, and structs required. The following  is an example of a problem that WFCCN cannot be used to find: One vendor used noncompliant  method signatures with int instead of STRS_Buffer_Size, but on that platform, both integer items  compiled as the same type. Using a type that happens to correspond to the vendor\u2019s  implementation of an STRS type is not necessarily portable to the next platform.   and discussed in one or more workshops at various points in the project life cycle. This  alternative is to be decided by the mission or project. A full release and delivery of all STRS OE  source code is not required in order to perform STRS compliance testing. Each vendor or partner  should inspect his or her own software and documents before delivery. However, NASA found  its own review to be invaluable to ensure greater compliance and promote understanding of  differences among submitters.  reported to the supplier and the mission or project, along with any suggestions. It is the  responsibility of the mission or project to decide whether to grant deviations and waivers for any  noncompliances that are not resolved.              o help the reader and implementer of the STRS architecture understand the development and  use of the configuration files described in Appendix A, Example Configuration Files, an example  of a configuration file based on that format was developed. This example of a configuration file,  for a sample application WF1, is shown in this NASA Technical Handbook in figure 6, Example  of Predeployed Configuration File for Appendix A.     1) XML declaration.

There is no necessity or requirement for splitting the platform configuration files into  hardware and software parts as shown in Appendix A.1 and A.2. Splitting up the description this  way was just a logical way to organize the description.   devices, and services to be instantiated at boot-up or restart. Therefore, to use  STRS_InstantiateApp to instantiate applications in all cases, the platform configuration file  would specify the arguments. For this example, the OE-specific name argument referenced is the  application configuration file name whose predeployed format is shown in Appendix A.3. The  application configuration file may be independent of the platform configuration file.  he example in Appendix A splits the formatting into three parts to group the information  logically. The following explanations further clarify the necessity and intent of Appendix A:   here will most likely be more than one application in an STRS radio. In the C language, there is  no namespace support as in C++ or other object-oriented (OO) languages that scope the member  functions to the class. Thus, there will be multiple implementations of the same STRS  Application-provided API method names, starting with \u201cAPP_\u201d, one in each implementation of  an application.   to return a pointer to a table of pointers to the methods. Then, the OE could use these method  locations to call the methods. This technique and variations are described in NASA/TM-2011-  216948, Symbol Tables and Branch Tables: Linking Applications Together. The techniques  specify the creation of a branch table or indirect address table for each application. To suppress     (21) Tag MEMORYSIZE indicating that the size is 2670K gates.

The method  locations are saved in a structure associated with the STRS application and the appropriate  method is called as needed. The flow chart shown in figure 8, Obtain Array of Pointers to  Methods, gives some highlights. Note that, besides the method illustrated in figure 8, there are  other ways of creating an array of pointers to the C language methods. This array of pointers may  be used to invoke those methods later.  the common method names, compile and link each application separately. When the table is  registered with the OE, the OE could use the table to call the appropriate method.     The technique demonstrated in figure 8 might not be possible on a platform that needs  everything to be compiled and linked together ahead of time. Another technique would be to use  message queuing to communicate between independent applications, but this technique might be  awkward to use in practice. Another technique is to prepend the method name with a C-language  class name equivalent.                    he following sequence diagrams depict the relationship between the STRS infrastructure-  provided Application Control API beginning with \u201cSTRS_\u201d and the corresponding STRS  Application-provided Application Control API beginning with \u201cAPP_.\u201d The methods described  for figure 1 are those that cause a change in state. In this NASA Technical Handbook, the  methods depicted in figure 9, Simplified Sequence Diagram for STRS_InstantiateApp, figure 10,  Simplified Sequence Diagram for STRS_AbortApp, and figure 11, Simplified Sequence  Diagram for STRS_Configure, contain both those that cause a change in state as well as those  that do not. In this NASA Technical Handbook, since an STRS Device inherits all the methods  from an STRS application, as shown in figure 5, the methods in figures 9, 10, and 11 for STRS  applications could apply to STRS Devices as well. In figures 9, 10, and 11, \u201cCommand Source\u201d  is used for the object, internal to the radio, either an STRS application or part of the OE, which  calls the STRS infrastructure methods.                                 sequence diagram for each row in table 1, Substitutions for Figure 11, can be made from the  diagram in figure 11, by substituting the \u201cCOMMAND SOURCE TO OE\u201d method in place of  STRS_Configure and the corresponding \u201cOE TO STRS APPLICATION\u201d method in place of  APP_Configure.   COMMAND SOURCE TO OE  STRS_GroundTest  OE TO STRS APPLICATION  APP_GroundTest                  he APP_Instance and APP_Initialize methods are often used together successively but should  not be combined because they have different functionality. The separation of APP_Instance and  APP_Initialize supports encapsulation. It allows configuration to occur before APP_Initialize. In  figure 9, STRS_InstantiateApp calls APP_Instance and then it may call APP_Configure and  APP_Initialize, as specified by the configuration file. STRS_InitializeApp may do everything in  one call or additional calls may be needed thereby giving the greatest flexibility. Also, note that             he Wireless Innovation Forum (formerly SDR Forum) and SWRADIO by the OMG put so  much effort into SCA that it was decided to investigate these architectures. The result of that  investigation was that the CORBA requirements and XML parser requirements took up a lot of  memory and machine cycles but were not really necessary for NASA. One study showed that  eliminating CORBA and an XML parser reduced the memory footprint by an order of  magnitude. So, to save on SWaP for NASA\u2019s space platforms, it was decided to create a similar  STRS architecture without those disadvantages. After looking at use cases for NASA radios,  very similar functionality to the SCA and SWRADIO was decided to be necessary. Similar  method names to the application method names in SCA and SWRADIO were chosen for STRS.  The reasoning was that it would be easy to take advantage of the many man-years of effort that  had gone into defining those architectures, the Wireless Innovation Forum could comment on the  STRS architecture due to the similarities, and that SDR design tools might be easier to  use/generate for STRS applications.  A key recommendation from the Forum\u2019s space working group was to align with the OMG  SWRADIO specification where possible. To that end, mappings from the OMG SWRADIO PIM  to the STRS platform-specific model (PSM) were discussed. There were only minor differences  in the Space PIM that could map into STRS from OMG\u2019s SWRADIO PIM that mapped into  SCA. A quote from the Forum\u2019s study:  APP_Instance is a convenience function containing a constructor and saving any application  identifying information.   The SDR Forum recommended that the STRS align with the SDR Forum, the  OMG, and the IEEE SCC41 for purposes of distributing the burden and cost of  non-recurring engineering (NRE) across NASA and all consortia members  contributing to the STRS, and to further broaden and enhance the quality of the  implementation and deployment of STRS-based standards.  NASA\u2019s configuration files could be much simpler, because NASA\u2019s radios were less distributed  with no dynamic aspects needed to be specified in the configuration files. Furthermore, it was  decided that by preprocessing any XML configuration files, a much simpler parser could be used  on much simpler data.  n considerations for NASA-STD-4009A, it was determined that NASA\u2019s radios could be even  simpler and that some further complexities could be eliminated. Such changes eliminated the  possibility of harmonization with SCA but were more flexible regarding use with Core Flight  Software (cFS) and other frameworks.               requirements for security, and it is assumed to be up to the project/mission to define any security  requirements. It was determined that NASA radios typically do not require DO-178, Software  Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification; and red/black  separation. Security is needed to:         This is usually defined by the command and control for the mission and not by STRS.  The security functions should be encapsulated, separate from the external command and  control interpreter, so that the functionality may be changed if necessary without  affecting the STRS application implementation. This functionality may be invoked by the  STRS OE implementation or as a service for over-the-air command and control.     requirement. For example, one might restrict one waveform from aborting any  other waveform. In this case, it is suggested that a table be configured containing  allowed or disallowed commands and the associated source(s) handle names and  target(s) handle names for which the command applies such that the table could  be used to validate a command.    3) Specifying a key to allow the radio to override the restrictions of item \u201cb(2)\u201d is  also left as a possible project/mission requirement. In which case, security keys  and an authentication method is required.  Security requirements are defined by the project/mission and not by STRS. The security  functions of item \u201cb(2)\u201d and item \u201cb(3)\u201d should be encapsulated so that the functionality  may be changed if necessary, without affecting the STRS application implementation.  This functionality may then be invoked by the STRS infrastructure implementation.                 the items required to capture the digital logic of the hardware that can be configured remotely,  such as an FPGA. Configurable hardware design includes the items created to document the  design of the hardware, including the source code (e.g., very high speed integrated circuits  (VHSIC) hardware description language (VHDL), Verilog\u00ae) and the loadable files (e.g., FPGA  image).   versions of STRS documentation. Many definitions for firmware, including the latest IEEE  definition which was written in 1990, state that firmware resides in read-only memory and  cannot be modified. The changing definition of \u201cfirmware\u201d would likely lead to confusion, and a  new term was selected for the STRS documentation. Additional terms such as \u201ccomplex  electronics,\u201d \u201cconfigurable logic device,\u201d \u201cprogrammable logic device,\u201d and \u201csoftware\u201d were  considered, but each term was rejected due to potential confusion or implied limitations if the  term was used.   application. The term \u201csoftware\u201d in some contexts of the STRS (and other SDR-related)  documentation may include configurable hardware design. For example, whenever the term  software defined radio is used, both GPP and configurable hardware design are included. The  STRS architecture does not dictate processes or organizational structure for use in developing the  software or configurable hardware design. The project developing the SDR or application has to  dictate the required process.   he application instantiation process should not only instantiate the application but ensure that  the application starts in a known state. The application may be comprised of multiple items that  are loaded as part of the application instantiation process. The application instantiation process  should also ensure that data is configured consistently. This potentially multi-step process was  most easily customized by putting the variable instantiation data in a configuration or script file.  The configuration file is parsed and processed by the OE in STRS_InstantiateApp before calling  any methods in the application. Figure 10 illustrates that STRS_InstantiateApp could call  multiple application-provided methods as needed to begin execution in a consistent well-defined  manner. APP_Instance is the only method that is required to be called, but APP_Configure is  highly encouraged so that data does not have to be hard-coded in the application but may be  changed according to predetermined conditions and known upon application start-up in a  consistent manner. This is not a simple one-to-one relationship between STRS_InstantiateApp  and the other methods it invokes; whereas, it is a simple one-to-one relationship for most of the  other STRS application-provided application control methods and the corresponding STRS  infrastructure-provided application control methods.            To ensure that a user could not instantiate an application in an unknown state, STRS_Instance  that invoked APP_Instance was not allowed. STRS_Instance calling APP_Instance was  disallowed to discourage a user from instantiating an application in an unknown state. The  method name STRS_Instance was not reused for the multi-step process in order to highlight the  difference between simple instantiation of an application and instantiation of an application using  a configuration file.   handle name is a C language character string that specifies the name of a specific instance of  an STRS resource that may be an application, service, device, file, or queue. It is used in external  commands and messages. It is usually the same at each start-up of the radio platform unless  specifically changed. A handle ID is a numerical value determined by the infrastructure that  could contain an index, hash, address, or other data that help the OE locate the information  necessary to access the resource. It is used in internal method invocations and is restricted so that  STRS_ValidateHandleID can determine whether there is an error and STRS_GetErrorQueue can  indicate which error queue to use. It is often different at each start-up of the radio platform even  if the handle name remains the same.   he methods in the STRS APIs are not allowed to throw exceptions. Suppose a pre-existing  library contains functions that can throw exceptions and suppose a method in the STRS APIs  calls the library function. Then the method in the STRS APIs must catch all exceptions that the  library function can throw. The return result from the method in the STRS APIs will indicate  whether there has been an error or not.   project/mission requirements. The intention was that STRS Devices and STRS Services  encapsulate non-portable functionality or functionality that applies over multiple waveform  applications. Also, a further intention was that the STRS Devices have additional capabilities  beyond that allowed to an STRS application as if the STRS Device were part of the OE. It should  be required by the project that the platform provider create a sample application that uses a  sample STRS Device to exercise both the hardware and software for testing and that serves as a  model for what can be done by the application developer. The STRS Device would be included  with the corresponding sample STRS application. An STRS Device would be specified as part of  the OE, for example, if the device is not really programmable but can be adjusted or turned  on/off by the HAL.    correspond to an STRS application such that the application developer must be able to modify  the sample and compile it with the user's STRS application. The application developer needs to          .20 How does the application know how to put the data (address, command, data) into  the buffer in the specialized hardware?   could be a sink for some data created elsewhere by implementing APP_Write. That application  could call STRS_Write to send the data from the application to the STRS Device that also acts as  a sink by implementing APP_Write in the STRS Device. Then the STRS Device could use the  HAL to send the data to the specialized hardware.   change at every message. The contents and format of the buffer can be defined for your  application.  t has been suggested that EDS be used to configure STRS Devices. The CCSDS has a Draft  Recommended Standard for Spacecraft Onboard Interface Services\u2014XML specification for  Electronic Data Sheets for Onboard Devices, CCSDS 876.0. Allowing the use of CCSDS EDS  has merit and does not conflict with the STRS requirements since the data sheet configuration  file would be in XML as required and may be transformed to a deployed format if needed. Since  the CCSDS EDS allows extensions, any specific requirements in this area are better left to the  Project.  means of enabling the OE to call the STRS application-provided methods and vice versa. Things  can get as complicated as necessary depending on the desired distribution of the software across  the address spaces and the availability of the appropriate middleware or equivalent. Using  STRS_API as a representative infrastructure-provided interface called from some command  source and APP_API as a corresponding application-provided interface implemented within  some application, some examples could be depicted as:    wrap the HAL invocation(s) into STRS Devices and handle the message format to/from the  application and specialized hardware.  1. STRS_API1 -> APP_API1  2. STRS_API1 -> APP_API1 -> STRS_API_Ethernet-> STRS_API2 -> APP_API2  3. STRS_API1 -> APP_API(tx) ~~~ APP_API(rx) -> STRS_API2 -> APP_API2  4. STRS_API1 -> distribution point -> ... -> collection point -> APP_API2  5. STRS_API1 -> distribution point -> ... -> collection point -> APP_API1 -> STRS_API2 ->                 call the corresponding APP API methods. For 2 or 3 above, the call is direct to some application  object that controls the access to another application in another address space (or even another  radio) via Ethernet, remote procedure call (RPC), over-the-air (OTA) signal, Bluetooth, etc. For  situations where this will not work, including multiple address spaces as depicted in 4 above, any  middleware may be inserted in between, such as CORBA. In 5 above, an additional level of  complication was added, just to show one of the many combinations. Some of these ideas were  used when a graphical user interface (GUI) was added that was situated on a different computer  using a different operating system.  he following figure 12, Multiple Connected Radios, can be used to illustrate 2 or 3 above when  the networking is encapsulated in applications for sending and receiving using Ethernet or other  means of message passing across the address spaces. For the figure below, WF1 is the command  source for STRS_API1 and WFtx is the sink for the corresponding command. After passing  through the connection, the same command is repeated where now the dependent command  source for STRS_API2 is WFrx and WF2 is the sink. One cannot get greater separation than when  the applications reside in what appear to be different radios. The following figure can be used to  illustrate 4 above when the connection from WFtx to WFrx is replaced by middleware marshalling  and unmarshalling the data.    STRS application. An STRS application may require a main entry point if specified by the  platform provider.                The idea was to leave as much leeway as possible while having much of the initialization and  control code being portable. The word \"application\" was used in its broadest sense so that it can  include a main program or not, depending on the STRS infrastructure-required interfaces. The  infrastructure-provider is obligated to describe the interface mechanism so that additional  applications may be written or ported. The infrastructure must contain a main entry point or the  equivalent so it can be started.  he integrator must have all applications, shared libraries as well as main at compile and link  time for proper linking on the target. The dynamic linking/loading capabilities of some operating  systems may be useful to add additional applications at a later time as needed.

STRS provides for  a clock rate adjustment using STRS_SetTimeAdjust. A user would need to set up loops to check  the clock periodically for drift. One way is to use STRS_TimeSynch with a maximum time step  that returns the number of maximum time steps left to do. If this seldom returns zero, a time  adjustment is in order. The size of the adjustment is clock-dependent. Iterate until the clocks  generally stay in synch.               the application for instantiation that may impose additional operations to be performed as  documented by the platform provider. The project manager and platform provider will decide  whether this parameter is to be a class name, or a file name. Usually, the latter is selected to be a  software configuration file or script file to give the greatest flexibility for the STRS infrastructure  to specify default or initial attributes of software items pertaining to the platform or applications,  services, and devices contained on an STRS radio. Application-specific information for  configuration and customization of installed applications may be provided, as well as  information for the STRS infrastructure to use to instantiate applications on the radio GPP. Such  files provide STRS application developers with flexibility in choosing parameters and values  deemed pertinent to the implementation. In a specific case actually encountered, the parameters  within the application changed based on ambient conditions such that a set of calibration tests  were performed and the results stored in a configuration file. Using a configuration file allowed  the code to remain unchanged.  platform and application configuration data because XML has the ability to identify  configuration information in a standard, human-legible, precise, flexible, and adaptable method.  XML is a markup language for documents containing structured information that contains both  content and some indication of what role that content plays. XML defines tags containing or  delimiting content and showing the relationships between them (see http://www.w3.org/XML/).  Because of the extra overhead required to transmit and process XML-formatted data, it is  anticipated that the XML configuration file would be preparsed, additional error checking on the  file will be performed, and the XML file transformed into a simpler, more compact form prior to  transmission. This process will reformat the configuration file into an appropriately optimized  configuration file, which will subsequently be loaded into the radio.   n XML Schema Definition (XSD) file contains an XML schema describing the structure and  constraining the content of XML documents (See http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema). An XML  schema can provide error checking of allowable values, dependencies, and range limits of  configuration parameters.  n XML interface tool could be used to create and modify platform and application configuration  files. When used with an XML schema, these tools standardize the XML data entry, enforcing error  checking and interdependency checks to ensure that the entered data are correct and within the  hardware and software limits.   radio while keeping the equivalent content. Figure 13, XML Transformation and Validation,  illustrates the relationships between an XML file and its corresponding schema, as well as  representing the preprocessing of the XML file in a simplified form using Extensible Stylesheet  Language (XSL). XSL is a family of recommendations for defining XML document  transformation into text for presentation. (See http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/.)            Schema is used to validate  XML. XML follows Schema.  XSL is used to  transform XML.     STRS integrators using information obtained from both the STRS platform provider and the  STRS application developers. The STRS integrators use the application configuration files to  install the applications on the platform. These roles may overlap at times.   software environment for the STRS infrastructure. Developing platform configuration file(s) is  the likely method to be used by an STRS platform provider to identify the existence of the  different hardware modules and their associated configuration files to allow the OE to instantiate  drivers and test applications. An STRS platform configuration file may be used when starting the  STRS infrastructure to configure various properties of the STRS platform. Configuring these  properties at run-time allows greater flexibility than configuring them at compile-time. To  increase the runtime flexibility of the STRS platform, the STRS infrastructure is likely to use  deployed platform configuration files to determine the existence and attributes of the files,  devices, queues, waveforms, and services contained on the STRS radio. Attributes of files,  devices, and queues could include access (read/write, both, or append), type (text or binary), and  other properties. The name of the starting configuration file(s) may be provided to the STRS  infrastructure upon initialization. The predeployed platform configuration files should contain  platform configuration information such as the following:  a. Hardware module names and types.  b. Memory types, sizes, and access.  c. Memory mapping.  d. Unique names and attributes of files, devices, queues, services, and applications                      predeployed STRS application configuration file could be created by the STRS integrator  using platform information, the XML schema supplied by the STRS platform provider, and  application information provided by the STRS application developer. The deployed application  configuration file would be used by the infrastructure (see the STRS_InstantiateApp method)  when starting the STRS application to configure various properties of the STRS application.  Configuring these properties at run time allows greater flexibility than configuring them at  compile time. For example, one might configure the STRS handle names of files, devices,  queues, waveforms, and services needed by the STRS application so that these can be easily  changed. Since a service is actually an application that has been incorporated into the STRS  infrastructure, the format of the application configuration file should be a subset of the format of  the platform configuration file as specified by the schema. If any STRS application resources  need to be loaded separately into memory or into a device, such as an FPGA, before the STRS  application can function properly, these should be specified in the configuration file for that  STRS application.          A. Filename of loadable image.  B. Target on which to put loadable image file.  C. Target memory in bytes, number of gates, or logic elements.    he platform boot process generally has many parts, depending on the project requirements for  safety and confidence. Built-in testing is often performed even before the STRS OE is initialized.  Once the STRS OE is started, it is expected that further platform diagnostics be reported to the  STRS OE using the STRS APIs as required by STRS-2. The STRS radio is expected to have a  known power up condition where it is ready to receive commands, send telemetry, and transmit  and receive communications according to the project requirements. Upgrades to the boot process  could allow changes to the OS, OE, and/or applications to be made in a secure fashion.                  he STRS architecture allows STRS radios to provide cognitive, radiometric tracking,  navigation, and other services that are integrated with communication services. Cognitive  services obtain metrics to monitor the radios\u2019 operation, learns how to optimize the performance  of the radio, and modifies the operation of the radio accordingly. Radiometric tracking is the  process of measuring the characteristics of radio signals that have been transmitted (potentially  over several legs) in order to extract information relating to the signal\u2019s change in frequency  and/or time of transit. A radio has the fundamental component needed for tracking\u2014a radio  signal. The SDR simplifies the navigation architecture because it minimizes mass, power, and  volume requirements while maximizing flexibility. An SDR provides the flexibility to respond to  different mission phase requirements and to dynamic application requirements where signal  structures may change. This is the fundamental reason for considering the implementation of an  SDR with tracking and navigation functionality.    Various editors and compilers usually use the file extension (after the last period) to make a  decision about the type of file and how to use it so that it is helpful to have different code and  header file extensions for C and C++. Furthermore, when C code is used in a C++ method,  \u2018extern \u201cC\u201d\u2019 may be used to indicate that that the interface is to be that for C rather than  C++. For example, to declare a C language method in C++:   // Function to report statistics (C language)  void MyServiceReportStatistics( MyServiceType myType );   There is a way of using a #ifdef to check whether the code is in C code or C++ code, if  necessary, when the same header file is used for both C and C++. For example:   #ifdef __cplusplus  extern \"C\" {  #endif   \u2026  #ifdef __cplusplus  }  #endif                he following sections address each requirement in turn, displaying the rationale, the related  higher-level requirements, verification method, and other pertinent information, which augment  the general rationale given earlier in this document.  n each section, the title line contains the requirement number and the title of the requirement.  That is followed by the text of the requirement. The rationale describes why the requirement is  needed. The category contains one or more of the summary capabilities from NASA/TM-2007-  215042. The categories are chosen from the following list: adaptability, availability,  extensibility, flexibility, interoperability, portability, (implying reusability too), scalability,  reliability, and reconfigurability. The traced-from specifies the section numbers in NASA/TM-  2007-215042 that apply to this requirement. The use case specifies the names of the use case  sections in NASA/TP-2008-214813 that apply to this requirement. The related to specifies the  part of the STRS radio that has to satisfy the requirement where platform indicates that the  hardware and related documentation are tested, OE indicates that the OS and infrastructure and  related documentation are tested, and application indicates that the application and related  documentation are tested. The notes contain additional explanations for the requirement.   is chosen from the following list: Analysis, inspection, observation, similarity, or test. Tests are  not used because tests are expected to be mission requirements rather than STRS requirements.   STRS REQUIREMENTS, RATIONALE, AND VERIFICATION  METHOD  a. Analysis is the process of utilizing analytical techniques to verify that requirements  have been satisfied. This method may be used when qualification by test is not possible, when a  test would introduce significant risk into the software, or when analysis is an appropriate, cost-  effective qualification method.   special tests. Inspection is usually a visual examination, but it may be computer-aided. Using a  script or WFCCN refers to the STRS compliance tools as described in the NASA/TM-2011-  217266, STRS Compliance Testing document. A compliance certification testing facility is  available at Glenn Research Center (GRC) to perform compliance testing and will test all STRS  applications submitted to the STRS Application Repository. The users may use their own tools  as an independent check of an OE or of an application prior to submitting the application to the  STRS Application Repository.

Observation is a method of qualification that is limited to readily observable  functional operation to determine compliance with requirements. This method of qualification  does not require the use of special equipment or sophisticated instrumentation.  . Similarity is the process of using analysis and/or \u201cdelta testing\u201d to prove the design  adequacy of an item by reference to the prior qualification of an identifiable item that has been  qualified for a similar application.   to, the evaluation of functional characteristics by the use of special equipment or  instrumentation, simulation techniques, and the application of established principles and  procedures to determine compliance with requirements. The analysis of data derived from a test  is an integral part of the method.   STRS_APP_RUNNING, shown in the examples, are variables for states, which would have to be  defined locally.            An STRS platform shall have a known state after completion of the power-up  process.  To increase the reliability of the STRS platform after reboot or power cycle,  the radio has to be able to return to full operation autonomously without the  need for external equipment or procedures.      A known state is one that is predictable from documentation or from  configuration file(s) or scripts or some combination thereof.          To increase the reliability and availability of the STRS platform, there has to  be a means of providing data to identify configuration information as well as  status and fault identification. Data for both BITs and recognition of  operational degradation and malfunction have to be available.                  This requirement was deleted because STRS-2 wording was made more  robust, STRS-3 became redundant. STRS-3 previously stated: Self-  diagnostic and fault-detection data shall be created for each module so that it  is accessible to the STRS OE.            The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  behavior and capability of each major functional device or resource available  for use by waveforms, services, or other applications (e.g., FPGA, GPP, DSP,  or memory), noting any operational limitations.  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information. Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible  without designing a new platform.         The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  reconfigurability behavior and capability of each reconfigurable component.  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information.

The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  behavior and performance of the RF modular component(s).  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information. Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible  without designing a new platform.                                  The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  interfaces that are provided to and from each modular component of the  STRS platform.  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information. Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible  without designing a new platform.     Platform provider  None                       The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  control, telemetry, and data mechanisms of each modular component (i.e.,  how to program or control each modular component of the platform, and how  to use or access each device or software component, noting any proprietary  and nonstandard aspects).  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information. Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible  without designing a new platform.     Platform provider  None                  The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  behavior and performance of any power supply or power converter modular  component(s).  Waveform developers need to know the features and limitations of the  platform for their applications. Once the radio has been procured, NASA has  the knowledge to procure or produce new or additional modules using HID  information. Also, future module replacement or additions will be possible  without designing a new platform.                          An STRS application shall use the STRS infrastructure-provided APIs and  POSIX\u00ae API for access to platform resources.  For an open architecture to support portability, the architecture has to be  standardized across platforms and implementations. Rather than creating  many more APIs in STRS, the currently available POSIX\u00ae standard was  selected. Thus, POSIX\u00ae subsets were chosen to implement certain OS  services missing from the list of STRS Application-provided methods. The  POSIX\u00ae subsets are widely available, implemented by multiple OSs, and  scalable. Layering of the architecture separates and encapsulates functionality  so that the parts are less influenced by changes to the other. This separation  of functionality promotes portability.                  The STRS infrastructure shall use the STRS platform HAL APIs to  communicate with application components on the platform specialized  hardware via the physical interface defined by the STRS platform provider.  The HAL API is to be published so that specialized hardware made by one  company may be integrated with the STRS infrastructure made by a different  company.  The HAL API documentation is to include a description of each method or  function used, including its calling sequence, return values, an explanation of  its functionality, any preconditions before using the method or function, and  the status after using the method or function.  The HAL API documentation is to also contain information about the  underlying hardware such as address and data interfaces, interrupt input and  output, power connections, and other control and data lines necessary to  operate in the STRS platform environment.                        1) Application (or OE) or system component software and configurable  hardware design simulation model(s) and/or documentation).

To have confidence that the design and  implementation meet the NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 7150.2,  NASA Software Engineering Requirements, additional information about  standards, reviews, and tests must be provided.                    If the STRS application has a component resident outside the GPM (e.g., in  configurable hardware design), then the component shall be controllable from  the STRS OE.  The layering of the architecture introduces the need for the GPP to be able to  control, configure, and monitor many aspects of the SPM. For portability,  waveform applications use STRS APIs, which access the HAL or POSIX\u00ae  API within the STRS OE as needed.                           The STRS SPM developer shall provide a platform-specific wrapper for each  user-programmable FPGA, which performs the following functions:     developer. This may be a complete abstraction of the actual FPGA  pinouts with only waveform application signal names provided.  To aid in the portability of waveform applications within an FPGA, a  platform-specific wrapper provides an additional layer separating the  interface between the GPP and SPM/FPGA from the signal processing  functionality within the FPGA.              The STRS SPM developer shall provide documentation on the configurable  hardware design interfaces of the platform-specific wrapper for each user-  programmable FPGA, which describes the following:               When functions, interfaces, components, and/or design rules are defined and  published, the architecture is open. Open architecture facilitates  interoperability among commercial and government developers and  minimizes the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software  components.

The STRS infrastructure shall use the STRS Application-provided  Application Control API to control STRS applications.  Layering of the architecture separates and encapsulates functionality so that  the parts are less influenced by changes to the other. This separation of  functionality promotes portability.        The STRS Application-provided Application Control  API refers to the API defined in STRS-29 through  STRS-39, STRS-114 through STRS-116, and the  corresponding tables 5 through 18. The method names in  the STRS Application-provided Application Control API  begin with \u201cAPP_\u201d.                                      The STRS OE shall support ISO/IEC C or C++, or both, language interfaces  for the STRS Application-provided Application Control API at compile-time.  Because portability is a basic goal but middleware is not required, a totally  language-independent solution was not available.

The year is  not included in the requirement, so that obsolete compilers are not mandated.          For portability, standard names are defined for various constants, data types,  and method prototypes in the API.

For an open architecture to support portability, the architecture has to be standardized  across platforms and implementations.

STRS-73 solves the potential problem of I/O methods missing from NASA-  STD-4009A. Since not all SDRs will have a file system, this method should  be used sparingly with comments describing its purpose.

In particular, waveform  applications and services have to use standard interfaces across all platforms.                                  The STRS applications shall use the STRS Infrastructure Messaging, STRS  Infrastructure Data Source, and STRS Infrastructure Data Sink methods to  establish queues to send messages between components.  In an SDR executing multiple threads or processes, messages have to be  processed using message passing methods so that they do not interfere with  each other. One example might be a receive application queuing its data for a  subsequent transmit application. Another example might be the queuing of  error messages from STRS_Log.      The STRS Infrastructure Messaging methods refer to the API defined in  STRS-77, STRS-80, STRS-81 and STRS-126 through STRS-129 as well as  corresponding tables 58 through 63.

For portability of waveform applications, a standard API for using timers in  the GPP was necessary. The timers are expected to be used for relatively low  accuracy timing such as time stamps, timed events, and time constraints. As  the speed of new GPPs increases over time, the timers are expected to be  used for signal processing.      The STRS Infrastructure Time Control methods refer to the API defined in  STRS-82 through STRS-88, STRS-130 through STRS-133 and  corresponding tables 64 through 73 in NASA-STD-4009A.

For an open architecture to support portability, the architecture has to be  standardized across platforms and implementations. Rather than creating  many more APIs in STRS, the currently available POSIX\u00ae standard was  selected. Thus POSIX\u00ae subsets were chosen to implement certain OS  services missing from the list of STRS Application-provided methods. The  POSIX\u00ae subsets are widely available, are implemented by multiple OSs, and  are scalable.

(2) Information required to address the underlying hardware, including  interrupt input and output, memory mapping, and the configuration  data necessary to operate in the STRS platform environment.  The HAL API is to be published so that specialized hardware made by one  company may be integrated with the STRS infrastructure made by a different  company.  The HAL API documentation is to include a description of each method or  function used, including its calling sequence, return values, an explanation of  its functionality, any preconditions before using the method/function, and the  status after using the method or function.  The HAL API documentation is to also contain information about the  underlying hardware such as address and data interfaces, interrupt input and  output, power connections, plus other control and data lines necessary to  operate in the STRS platform environment.          The STRS platform provider shall provide STRS platform HAL  documentation that includes the following:                 Precondition  Postcondition  See Also  Example  RESOURCE_NAME resourceName)  Open a resource by name.

STRS-11  stated the same thing, with only a few words different, so STRS-93 was  redundant. STRS-93 previously stated: The STRS infrastructure shall use the  HAL APIs to communicate with the specialized hardware via the physical  interface defined by the STRS platform provider.       To adapt to changing circumstances, an STRS radio has to accept external  commands from a ground station, another satellite, or another system on the  same satellite. The external commands have to be validated as required by the                              mission. There has to be a way to determine whether or not the command  worked and, for some commands, the resulting values.    Waveform Upload, STRS OE Upload, Waveform Instantiation, Waveform  Start, Processor Resource Sharing with Flight Computer, Set Waveform  Parameter, Get Waveform Parameter, Transmit a Packet, Receive a Packet,  Waveform Stop, Waveform Deallocation, Waveform Abort, Waveform  Remove, Built-In-Test               An STRS platform shall execute external application control commands  using the standardized STRS APIs.  To promote portability and adaptability, the use of the standard STRS APIs  is required. One waveform should be able to control another waveform or  device in a portable manner.    Waveform Upload, STRS OE Upload, Waveform Instantiation, Waveform  Start, Processor Resource Sharing with Flight Computer, Set Waveform  Parameter, Get Waveform Parameter, Transmit a Packet, Receive a Packet,  Waveform Stop, Waveform Deallocation, Waveform Abort, Waveform  Remove, Built-In Test            The STRS infrastructure shall use the STRS_Query method to service  external system requests for information from an STRS application.  The only way to request information from an application is by means of data  values returned when an application method is invoked. The  STRS_Query/APP_Query methods are designed for this purpose. Although  STRS_RunTest/APP_RunTest could be used to request data values, they are  designed for testing.                 This requirement was deleted because it was the same as STRS-57. STRS-97  previously stated: An STRS application shall use the STRS_Log and  STRS_Write methods to send STRS telemetry set information to the external  system. STRS-97 was less clear than STRS-57 because STRS-97 involved  the external interface, not just the application to infrastructure call. Also, in  some implementations, the application telemetry may not be sent directly to  the external interface but may be sent to a file from which the telemetry may  be downloaded as necessary.    (Optional, OE-specific) The STRS platform provider shall document the  necessary platform information (including a sample file) to develop a  predeployed application configuration file in XML 1.0.  When functions, interfaces, components, and/or design rules are defined and  published, the architecture is open. Open architectures facilitate  interoperability among commercial and government developers and minimize  the operational impact of upgrading hardware and software components.  Leveraging the existing XML standard may reduce NASA\u2019s costs and risks  by increasing reliability.                   This requirement was deleted because it is redundant. This requirement is  replaced by STRS-12 (3). STRS-99 previously stated: The STRS application  developer shall document the necessary application information to develop a  predeployed application configuration file in XML 1.0.                                (Optional, OE-specific) The STRS integrator shall provide a predeployed  application configuration file in XML 1.0.  A waveform (STRS application) configuration file contains specific  information that (1) allows STRS to instantiate the application; (2) provides  default configuration values; and (3) provides connection references to ports  and services needed by the application. The format of the configuration files  has to be defined in XML using an XML schema. The XML should be  preprocessed to optimize space in the STRS radio memory while keeping the  equivalent content. Examples include platform configuration files, STRS  infrastructure configuration files as a XML schema, and waveform  configuration files that contain specific information that allows STRS to  instantiate the application, provide default configuration values, and provide  connection references to ports and services needed by the application.  Leveraging the existing XML standard may reduce NASA\u2019s costs and risks  by increasing reliability.                (Optional, OE-specific) The predeployed STRS application configuration file  shall identify the following application attributes and default values:           A waveform (STRS application) configuration file contains specific  information that (1) allows STRS to instantiate the application; (2) provides  default configuration values; and (3) provides connection references to ports  and services needed by the application. The format of the configuration files  has to be defined in XML using an XML schema. The XML should be              preprocessed to optimize space in the STRS radio memory while keeping the  equivalent content. Examples include platform configuration files, STRS  infrastructure configuration files as a XML schema, and waveform  configuration files that contain specific information that allows STRS to  instantiate the application, provide default configuration values, and provide  connection references to ports and services needed by the application.    (Optional, OE-specific) The STRS platform provider shall provide an XML  1.0 schema definition (XSD) file to validate the format and data for  predeployed STRS application configuration files, including the order of the  tags, the number of occurrences of each tag, and the values or attributes.  A waveform (STRS application) configuration file contains specific  information that (1) allows STRS to instantiate the application; (2) provides  default configuration values; and (3) provides connection references to ports  and services needed by the application. The format of the configuration files  has to be defined in XML using an XML schema. Since the term XML  schema was variously interpreted to mean either a description or a file, the  requirement was clarified to specify that an XML schema definition (XSD)  file is required. The XML should be preprocessed to optimize space in the  STRS radio memory while keeping the equivalent content. Examples include  platform configuration files, STRS infrastructure configuration files as a  XML schema, and waveform configuration files that contain specific  information that allows STRS to instantiate the application, provide default  configuration values, and provide connection references to ports and services  needed by the application. Leveraging the existing XML standard may reduce  NASA\u2019s costs and risks by increasing reliability.                                           (Optional, OE-specific) The STRS platform provider shall document the  transformation (if any) from a predeployed application configuration file in  XML into a deployed application configuration file and provide the tools to  perform such transformation.  A waveform (STRS application) configuration file contains specific  information that (1) allows STRS to instantiate the application; (2) provides  default configuration values; and (3) provides connection references to ports  and services needed by the application. The format of the configuration files  has to be defined in XML using an XML schema. The XML should be  preprocessed to optimize space in the STRS radio memory while keeping the  equivalent content. Examples include platform configuration files, STRS  infrastructure configuration files as an XML schema, and waveform  configuration files that contain specific information that allows STRS to  instantiate the application, provide default configuration values, and provide  connection references to ports and services needed by the application.                  (Optional, OE-specific) The STRS integrator shall provide a deployed STRS  application configuration file for the STRS infrastructure to place the STRS  application in the specified state.  A waveform (STRS application) configuration file contains specific  information that (1) allows STRS to instantiate the application; (2) provides  default configuration values; and (3) provides connection references to ports  and services needed by the application. The format of the configuration files  has to be defined in XML using an XML schema. The XML should be  preprocessed to optimize space in the STRS radio memory while keeping the  equivalent content. Examples include platform configuration files, STRS  infrastructure configuration files as an XML schema, and waveform  configuration files that contain specific information that allows STRS to  instantiate the application, provide default configuration values, and provide  connection references to ports and services needed by the application.                           The STRS infrastructure APIs shall have an ISO/IEC C language compatible  interface.  Because portability is a basic goal but middleware is not required, a totally  language-independent solution was not available. The lowest common  denominator turns out to be a C language interface. Using a standard  ISO/IEC 9899 C or ISO/IEC 14882 C++ aids portability. The year is not  included in the requirement, so that obsolete compilers are not mandated.              An STRS application shall use the appropriate constant, typedef, or struct  defined in table 74, STRS Predefined Data, when the data are used to interact  with the STRS APIs.  For portability, standard names are defined for various constants and data  types.            An STRS platform provider shall document the external commands  describing their format, function, and any STRS methods invoked.  To adapt to changing circumstances, an STRS radio has to accept external  commands from a ground station, another satellite, or another system on the  same satellite. The external commands have to be validated as required by the  mission. There has to be a way to determine whether the command worked                           and, for some commands, the resulting values. To promote portability and  adaptability, the use of the standard STRS APIs is required.    Waveform Upload, STRS OE Upload, Waveform Instantiation, Waveform  Start, Processor Resource Sharing with Flight Computer, Set Waveform  Parameter, Get Waveform Parameter, Transmit a Packet, Receive a Packet,  Waveform Stop, Waveform Deallocation, Waveform Abort, Waveform  Remove, Built-In-Test           The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  thermal and power limits of the hardware at the smallest modular level to  which power is controlled.  The power consumption and resulting heat generation of a reprogrammable  FPGA will vary according to the amount of logic used and the clock  frequency(s). The power consumption may not be constant for each possible  waveform that can be loaded on the platform. The STRS platform provider  should document the maximum allowable power available and thermal  dissipation of the FPGA(s) on the basis of the maximum allowable thermal  constraints of FPGA(s) of the platform. For human spaceflight environments,  touch temperature requirements may limit dissipation further; therefore, these  reductions are to be factored into the given dissipation limits.                An STRS platform shall have a GPM that contains and executes the STRS  OE and the control portions of the STRS applications and services software.  The GPM contains and executes the STRS OE, including POSIX\u00ae, STRS  interface code, and configuration file parsing, to support the corresponding  requirements. A layered hardware architecture augments the layered software               architecture by providing the ability to change portions without affecting  other portions to support extensibility, adaptability, and portability.         The STRS platform provider shall provide an \u201cSTRS_APIs.h\u201d that contains  the method prototypes for the infrastructure APIs.  For portability, standard names are defined for various constants, data types,  and method prototypes in the API.                    For portability, standard names are defined for various constants, data types,  and method prototypes in the API.        The STRS platform provider shall provide an \u201cSTRS_DeviceControl.h\u201d that  contains the method prototypes for each STRS Device and, for C++, the class                                 definition for the base class STRS_DeviceControl, which inherits from the  base class STRS_ApplicationControl.  For portability, standard names are defined for various constants, data types,  and method prototypes in the API.                          If the STRS Device-provided Device Control API is implemented in C++, the  STRS Device class shall be derived from the STRS_DeviceControl base  class.  For portability, standard names are defined for various constants, data types,  and method prototypes in the API.          For example, the MyDevice.h file should contain a class definition of the  form:  class MyDevice: public STRS_DeviceControl  [, public STRS_Source]  [, public STRS_Sink]  {\u2026};  Note: [] indicates optional.

Appendix A also describes example  configuration file formats. STRS configuration files contain platform- and application-specific  information for the customization of installed applications. These examples are not required  formats. They are intended to illustrate some considerations that STRS platform providers and  STRS application developers should take into account when designing their configuration file  formats.    hardware is implemented in an XML schema. This format is shown in figure 14, Example of  Hardware Portion of STRS Platform Configuration File.                                 The unique name for each hardware module accessible from the current GPP. The  current GPP is denoted by SELF.  The name of the hardware type. The hardware module types may be GPP, RF,  FPGA, DSP, ASIC, and so forth.  A list of memory areas of various types. See below for further information.  o MEMORYTYPE  o MEMORYSIZE  o MEMORYUNITS   Memory type may be RAM, EEPROM, etc.  The number of memory units.  Memory units may be BYTES or GATES. For any GPP, the size is to be  in BYTES.  Memory access for the memory. Access may be READ, WRITE, or  BOTH.   This list provides the base addresses and memory size of regions of the current GPP  RAM (SELF) that are memory mapped to the module: that is, memory mapped to an  external device. There may be more than one item in the list when different parts of  memory are either not contiguous or are used for different purposes. See section A.2,  under DEVICE list, in ATTRIBUTE list, for memory offsets specific to the device  associated with a name.   o MEMORYBASENAME  o MEMORYBASEADDRESS The starting byte address reserved for memory mapping.  o MEMORYSIZE  Number of bytes starting at the base address reserved for memory  mapping.    Memory access for the portion of memory mapped to the module.  Access may be READ, WRITE, or BOTH. The access defined here may  be different from the memory access defined in the previous section  when part of the memory is used for one purpose and another part is  used for a different purpose.               software is implemented in an XML schema. This format is shown in figure 15, Example of  Software Portion of STRS Platform Configuration File.      \u2022 FILENAME  \u2022 FILETYPE  \u2022 FILEACCESS     \u2022 WAVEFORM  \u2022 QUEUE list  o BUFFERSIZE  o BUFFERNOS   A list of files to read, write, both, or append from multiple locations using a  handle ID.  Storage area name or fully qualified file name.  The file type may be TEXT or BINARY.  The file access may be READ, WRITE, BOTH, or APPEND. BOTH implies  update: that is, READ and WRITE.  This is a list of unique STRS handle names and corresponding objects.  A unique shortened form of the Device, Waveform, Queue, Pub/Sub name to use  as a character identifier to be used in messages and for obtaining the handle ID.  OE-specific name to instantiate the device. A device is software that acts as a  proxy for some hardware connection.  OE-specific name to instantiate the application.  The information necessary to create a FIFO queue.  The maximum size of messages in queue.  The maximum number of messages in queue.  OE-specific name for the Pub/Sub..           The correspondences between queues and subscribers. This couples publishers  and subscribers. UNREGISTER is the same as REGISTER except it decouples  publishers from subscribers.  The name of the queue that the publisher uses to send data to the subscribers. Used  in messages and for obtaining the handle ID.  A handle name for a subscriber. Used in messages and for obtaining the handle  ID.  A list of monitored items that are tested to indicate the health of the system.  The name of the property whose value is to be tested in a monitored component.  The handle name defines the monitored component from which to obtain the value  corresponding to the attributeName.  A positive value represents the nominal time delay between successive automated  tests of the monitored component. A nonpositive value indicates that the test is to  be requested.  The type of test to apply to the property to ascertain whether the value indicates  the monitored component is healthy. Examples include testing for exact values,  within ranges, or by use of operations in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).  Monitored value is to be one of the values in the value list.  Monitored value is not to be in the value list.  Monitored value is to be between the pairs of values in the value list including  both end points.  Monitored value is to be between the pairs of values in the value list including the  low end point and excluding the high end point.  Monitored value is to be between the pairs of values in the value list excluding the  low end point and including the high end point.  Monitored value is to be between the pairs of values in the value list excluding  both end points.  The attributeName, values to be tested, and operators are to appear in the value list  using RPN. RPN uses sequences of one or two arguments followed by an  operator. The result of applying the operator replaces the original sequence used,  and the process is repeated until there are no more operators. The attributeName  for the monitored value is replaced, in the RPN formula, by the corresponding  property value. For example, the sequence of data and operators in the VALUE  list for testing the property named D in RPN\u20140;D;LT;D;500;LE;AND\u2014is  equivalent to (0<D && D\u2264500)  he current set of operators includes the following: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, EQ,  NE, GT, GE, LT, LE, PLUS, MINUS, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, MOD, MIN, MAX.  If floating point is required or allowed, the set of operators could be augmented  with the following: SIN, COS, TAN, ASIN, ACOS, ATAN1, ATAN2, SINH,  COSH, TANH, ABS, EXP, LOG10, LN, SQRT, FLOOR, CEIL, ROUND, POW.  A list of values and possibly operations used corresponding to the value of  TESTTYPE.  o  For example, if TESTTYPE is EXACT, the VALUE list will contain  {512,1024,2048,4096} if those are the allowed values.  If TESTTYPE is EXCLUDE and odd numbers between 1 and 10 are not  allowed, the VALUE list will contain {1,3,5,7,9}.  If TESTTYPE is BETWEENII and the attribute D is allowed between 0 and  500, inclusive (0 \u2264 D \u2264 500), the VALUE list will contain {0,500}. Because  the TESTTYPE is BETWEENII, the lower limit, 0, is included and the  upper limit, 500, is included.  If TESTTYPE is BETWEENIX and the attribute D is allowed between 0  and 500 (0 \u2264 D < 500), the VALUE list will contain {0,500}. Because the        MONITOREDITEM list  \u2022 ATTRIBUTENAME  \u2022 HANDLENAME    o EXACT  o EXCLUDE  o BETWEENII              TESTTYPE is BETWEENIX, the lower limit, 0, is included and the upper  limit, 500, is excluded.  If TESTTYPE is BETWEENXI and the attribute D is allowed between 0  and 500 (0 < D \u2264 500), the VALUE list will contain {0,500}. Because the  TESTTYPE is BETWEENXI, the lower limit, 0, is excluded and the upper  limit, 500, is included.  If TESTTYPE is BETWEENXX and the attribute D is allowed between 0  and 500, exclusive (0 < D < 500), the VALUE list will contain {0,500}.  Because the TESTTYPE is BETWEENXX, the lower limit, 0, is excluded  and the upper limit, 500, is excluded.  If TESTTYPE is RPN and the attribute D is allowed between 0 and 500 (0 <  D \u2264 500), the VALUE list will contain {0,D,LT,D,500,LE,AND}.                                  If coded in C++, this is the application class name. If coded in C, this is an equivalent  class name.  The access to the application may be specified as READ, WRITE, BOTH, or NONE.  READ indicates that the application implements APP_Read(). WRITE indicates that  the application implements APP_Write().  The state at which the application is left after processing the configuration file. The  state may be INSTANTIATED, STOPPED, or RUNNING.  A list of files to be loaded for execution if not already loaded. Usually, the software  for the application on the current GPP (SELF) should be loaded before the  configurable hardware design so that the software can load and configure the  software or configurable hardware design as necessary.  o LOADFILENAME  o LOADTARGET   \u2022 MEMORYSIZE  \u2022 MEMORYUNITS  Storage area name or fully qualified file name  Module name for the device on which the file is instantiated. The load  process is determined by the corresponding MODULE information (see  A.1).  The number of memory units.  Memory units may be BYTES or, GATES. For any GPP, the size is to be  in BYTES.  o LOADTHREADTYPE  o LOADTHREADTAG  o LOADTHREADPRIORITY    he format of an independent STRS device configuration file in XML would be similar. An  example of the format of an independent STRS application configuration file in XML is shown  in Figure 17, Example of STRS Device Configuration File.  o NAME  o VALUE  Name of the attribute  Value of the attribute                                          Location in memory of the attribute when memory mapped.

NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  To meet safety requirements for manned space flight systems as given in NASA-STD-  5007, NSTS 1700.7B and NSTS 1700.7B ISS Addendum, all payload and experiment hardware  flown on the NASA Space Shuttle or International Space Station must be assessed for fracture  control implementation. This handbook provides methodology and approaches for  implementation of fracture control on payloads or experiments flown on these vehicles and is  written to satisfy the intent of the applicable NASA fracture control requirements for payloads  and experiments delineated in References 1-9 in Section 4.   experience related to fracture control assessment of hardware that has flown aboard the NASA  Space Shuttle. Experience has shown that, in general, relatively few parts or components in  payloads and experiments are truly \"fracture critical\". Some units or assemblies may have no  fracture critical parts. The guidance reflected in this handbook aids in classification of parts and  helps reduce the number of parts that, because of lack of definition, could be classified fracture  critical unnecessarily. Fracture critical designation requires special considerations and  treatment for the respective part. This is absolutely necessary on parts, whose failure is  catastrophic, but can become resource consuming and potentially schedule significant if parts  are classified fracture critical in a casual manner.  A viable fracture control program relies on design, analysis, non-destructive evaluation,  and tracking of fracture critical hardware. It is expected that flight hardware will be consistent  with aerospace standards, practices, and quality. It is beyond the scope, or intent, of this  document to address technical or quality disciplines that should already exist and be in place  irrespective of fracture control. Fracture control is imposed and required to enhance safety of  manned space flight systems. Fracture control programs can significantly supplement properly  designed, high quality hardware with additional assurance against catastrophic structural  failures caused by unexpected and/or undetectable flaws. Fracture control is not intended to  compensate for poor design, analytical errors, misuse, or poor quality. Although fracture control  can be effective in adding assurance of mission success, it is not specifically required for that  purpose in References 1-9.   leads to structural failure, reasonableness and credibility must prevail. Many bad things can be  imagined as a result of chained, unlikely events. Consequently, those who do fracture control  and those who judge it must put some restraint on their imaginations and temper them with the  likelihood that the events under consideration have a reasonable chance of occurring.   a. All individual structural parts contain flaws or crack-like defects. Minimum life of the  part may be determined by considering one and only one flaw in the most critical area of the  part and in the most unfavorable orientation.  b. The use of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques does not negate the above  assumption. NDE techniques establish a probable upper bound on the size of the assumed  FRACTURE CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION FOR PAYLOADS,  EXPERIMENTS, AND SIMILAR HARDWARE         initial flaw at a specified confidence level. If no flaws are detected during inspection, a flaw size  at least as large as the probable upper bound flaw size established by the appropriate NDE  technique should be used for analysis.    n the event previously flown hardware exists that was previously flown without full fracture  control, it should be assessed prior to subsequent reflight using an appropriate fracture control  approach.  t is recommended that the fracture control analyst become familiar with all portions of this  handbook. Information is included in the handbook body and in the appendices. Section 3  addresses responsibilities in fracture control. References for fracture control requirements and  information the analyst will find useful are presented in Section 4. Section 5 addresses non-  fracture critical and fracture critical hardware for generic and specific hardware items. The  methodology for assessing fracture critical parts is discussed in Section 6 and tracking for these  parts is discussed in Section 7. Section 8 provides documentation descriptions while Section 9  provides alternative methods for fracture control and Section 10 briefly discusses requirements  other than fracture control. An acronym list and definitions are given in Appendix A.  Appendices L through P give examples of fracture control documentation. Other appendices  provide pertinent information as referenced in the body of the handbook. An Index is included,  in addition to the Table of Contents, to assist the reader in finding specific information.   prescribed service period due to propagation of undetected pre-existing crack-like defects  (flaws). (NOTE: If cracks are detected, the part will normally be repaired or scrapped. Flight of  parts with known crack-like flaws is not permitted without specific analysis and approvals as  described in Section 6.4). The intent of this handbook is to provide fracture control  implementation guidance applicable to a variety of hardware designs and purposes. A variety of  fracture control considerations and options are addressed, many of which may not be applicable  to a given design. The user is encouraged to keep assessment of parts simple, and focused,  and to use this handbook, as appropriate, to aid in implementation of fracture control.  Information is provided to assist the user in the development of an effective Fracture Control  Plan, as well as other fracture control documentation, and in development and completion of an  acceptable and efficient fracture control program through identification of cost effective criteria,  procedures, and controls.    the general lines of responsibility and the parties involved in fracture control activities.

This should be done with the  oversight, advice, and approval of the Responsible Fracture Control Authority (RFCA). Fracture  control program responsibilities should be identified prior to the Phase I Safety Review for  payloads/ experiments that will be reviewed by the Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP), or  identified by the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for flight hardware that will be reviewed by a  safety authority not requiring phased reviews. For effective fracture control implementation, the  group, organization, or person(s) should be identified who have the following responsibilities:  a. Fracture classification of parts/components.  b. Identification and specification of required NDE inspections or any other special     d. Fracture mechanics, fatigue, and structural analyses.  e. Assessment of anomalies on fracture critical parts/components and for decisions    esigners and analysts should become familiar with fracture control requirements and conduct  a hardware assessment as delineated in Appendix E of this document to establish the fracture  criticality of structural parts and components. After a final list of fracture critical parts is  determined, the required analyses, inspections and other fracture control activity must be  implemented and monitored to assure timely and proper completion.  ost of this handbook is written for the analyst responsible for assembling the fracture control  plan, analysis, and much of the final documentation. The designers who design the hardware  and produce the drawings from which hardware is made also have an important responsibility in  fracture control.

All payload and experiment hardware must be examined to  determine its fracture control classification. Hardware may be classified as exempt, non-  fracture critical, or fracture critical. These three categories are broken down further to assist in  the classification of parts.   electrical circuit components/boards, electrical connectors (including locking devices), wire  bundles, seals, etc. Some small mechanical parts such as bearings and valve seats have  traditionally been developed and qualified through strong test programs and rigorous process         NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005                                             NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  control, which demonstrate their reliability. In the presence of these strong development  programs, these type parts may be exempt from fracture control with the approval of the RFCA.  on-fracture critical hardware generally includes the classifications of low released mass,  contained, fail safe, non-hazardous leak before burst (NHLBB) pressurized components, low  speed and low momentum rotating machinery, low strain composite parts, low risk parts and  fasteners, and protected glass. Section 5.1 gives a detail explanation of each of these  classifications and suggestions for classifying specific hardware items.  racture critical hardware includes pressure vessels, high energy or high momentum rotating  equipment, hazardous fluid containers, habitable modules, and any remaining hardware that  does not fit the first two categories of exempt or non-fracture critical. All fracture critical hardware  must be shown to meet fracture control requirements through analysis or test (Section 6.).  Section 5.2 provides criteria for classifying and assessing specific types of fracture critical  hardware.  objective is to determine the fracture critical parts and the secondary objective is to show that all  parts have been examined for their fracture criticality. To do this, all non-exempt parts should be  accounted for on a fracture control summary list that would be included in the fracture control  analysis report. Examples of such a summary list are given in Appendix E.   ssessment of hardware criticality must examine the different phases of application including  launch, on-orbit, and return-to-ground (including a contingency abort without ground services) to  determine the applicability and extent of fracture control. For example, a part may not be  fracture critical during the launch phase, but could be fracture critical for on-orbit service. In this  case fracture control assessments will address the on-orbit phase as well as other phases and  their potential effects on the on-orbit performance.  racture critical parts must be identified as such on the drawings. This alerts all who use the  drawing as to the criticality of the part. Designers and analysts must work together to assure  that required notations, including NDE and/or proof test requirements, etc., are provided on the  drawing for any fracture critical part.   of each of the non-fracture critical classifications and suggestions for classifying specific  hardware items as such. Those parts/components, which are identified as non-fracture critical  according to Appendix E, and are assessed by the applicable methods in this Section, should  comply with the intent of fracture control requirements without imposing further activity beyond  conventional aerospace verification and quality assurance procedures.  5.1.1 Low Released Mass. Released masses in the shuttle cargo bay can be  catastrophic hazards. Catastrophic release is based on potential penetration of the rear  bulkhead of the cargo bay during launch and penetration of the cargo bay \"floor\" during landing.  For on-orbit applications and hardware inside modules or special containers during launch, a  specific assessment based on potential damage to safety critical parts or assemblies must be  made. Potential release need only be examined for a single failure. Combinations of individual  failures leading to a potentially catastrophic release of mass need not be considered unless the  initial failure would overload remaining structural attachment beyond ultimate load capability.       whose failure would release a free mass in the Shuttle cargo bay weighing less than 0.25 pound  (113 gm), or less than 14/h pound (h = travel distance of the part in feet to the cargo bay aft  bulkhead) and whose single failure (including loss of function) would also not be a catastrophic  hazard in itself, can be classified non-fracture critical. Potential released masses in the cargo  bay using the 14/h ratio should be limited to two pounds.  otential release of a small mass in the crew cabin or a habitable module, due to a single point  failure, must also be examined for hazard potential. All parts in this category, of any size, whose  release would not be a catastrophic hazard during any phase of Shuttle launch or flight, can be  classified non-fracture critical. Parts in this category whose release would be a catastrophic  hazard are fracture critical and must be dispositioned per Section 5.2 and Appendix E.  asteners pre-loaded in tension, which have low fracture toughness, KIc/Fty < 0.33 in1/2 (1.66  mm1/2), must be limited to 0.03 pound (14 gm) potential free mass. If a fastener is steel and the  KIc value is not known, low fracture toughness must be assumed when the A basis ultimate  strength is greater than 180 ksi (1241 N/m2). Parts/components with a single point failure that  would exceed low released mass limits should, preferably, be contained (Section 5.1.12.), or  meet low risk criteria (Section 5.1.2) and therefore be classified non-fracture critical. Otherwise,  applicable requirements of Section 5.2 (fracture critical part) must be applied.  The following defines parts whose potential mass releases would have a very low or nil  probability of resulting in a catastrophic hazard and which are, therefore, non-fracture critical.   examined for consequences of single failure mass release on orbit. If any single failure mass  release would be a catastrophic hazard, appropriate fracture control must be applied to the  hardware. If a single failure could release a mass (independent of size), and it would not result in  a catastrophic occurrence or loss of a safety critical function, the part can be classified non-  fracture critical. Where uncertainty exists as to consequences of a release, the release velocity  must be no more than 35 ft/sec and the release momentum must be no more than 8.75 ft-lb/sec.   that would be contained by associated hardware and present no threat to safety. Single failure  mass releases that do not meet low released mass requirements, or which have not been  assessed for mass release hazard, can be assessed for safe containment of potential single  failure released mass by a surrounding enclosure. A part confined in a container or housing, or  otherwise positively restrained from free release; and when failure, in itself, would not result in a  catastrophic hazard, the part can be classified non-fracture critical. Included in this category are  stowed parts/components having a total weight of 70 pounds (31.8 kg) or less and which are  stowed according to NSTS requirements (NSTS 21000-IDD-MDK) in a mid-deck locker or  equivalent confinement during launch and landing. Parts/components weighing up to 200  pounds (91 kg) confined in standard get-away-special (GAS) canisters can also be accepted as  contained against mass releases into the cargo bay. Hardware that is designed for transport  to/from orbit in soft stowage bags such as the Cargo Transfer Bags described in SSP 50467  may be considered contained during launch and landing.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005         NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Pressurized components or rotating devices within stowed or contained hardware must be  assessed independently, as provided for in these guidelines, to assure against explosion and/or  release of fragments or hazardous fluids outside of the container, or over-pressurization and  catastrophic failure of the container/compartment. Containment of rotating devices must  consider the combined effect of rotational speed and potential for mass release to determine  classification (see 5.1.5.). A method for calculating containment of high energy rotating devices  is given in Appendix B.  ontained hardware must also be examined for potential damage effects of single point mass  releases inside of the confinement itself. Potential impact by released masses of 0.25 pound or  less need not be regarded as a catastrophic hazard to pressurized hardware or penetration of  the container. Potential single failure release of larger masses inside of apparent containment  must be assessed for hazard potential. Release of masses (of any size) within a container or  payload, that could credibly defeat an internal safety critical function, should be precluded by  appropriate technical measures, which may include compliance with requirements for low risk  part classification (See 5.1.12) or other techniques approved by the RFCA.   internal parts. Enclosures with openings can only be assessed for containment of parts larger  than accessible openings. Typical electronic boxes and related equipment, radios, cameras,  recorders, PCs, and similar close-packed and enclosed hardware can be regarded as  acceptable containers of internal parts without further assessment. Documented engineering  judgment may be used in other cases where it is self-evident that containment exists. In  instances of uncertainty an analysis or test should be conducted. The analysis or test should be  designed to assess the \"worst case\" condition (heaviest piece/greatest travel distance/thinnest  wall that could be penetrated, etc.) for the hardware in question. Successful containment for the  worst case will demonstrate containment for all other associated parts. Appendix B provides a  methodology for doing general containment analysis.  elease of a free mass from a fastener that is mechanically constrained (e.g., safety wired) can  be assumed to be non-credible. All constrained fasteners can be classified non-fracture critical  if failure does not result in a catastrophic hazard due to loss of structural integrity of the  fastener, or loss of a safety critical function.   open, the closure design must be one failure tolerant of accidentally opening, i.e., hinges,  latches, etc., must be redundant for keeping a door closed in the event one device fails.  Otherwise, containment cannot be assumed.   catastrophic hazard because there is redundant structure sufficient to redistribute the load path  or there is no catastrophic hazard associated with the failure. For purposes of fracture control,  structure (including fasteners, latches, and mechanisms) may be identified as \u201cfail safe\u201d and  classified non-fracture critical when it can be shown that, due to structural redundancy, structure  remaining (assumed unflawed) after any single structural failure can withstand the redistributed  loads with a minimum ultimate safety factor of 1.0 on limit load. Joint gapping is allowed under  fail safe or emergency conditions. When doing fail safe analysis, it is usually sufficient to  remove the member with the highest load and the member with the lowest margin (these may  not be the same) to assess fail safe capability. In highly redundant complex structures, the  analyst should document rationale for member selection and present it to the RFCA for  approval. There are structural fault tolerance requirements (Reference 26) for mechanisms         unrelated to fracture control that must also be met. Failures that are classified fail safe must not  result in release of unacceptable free masses (see Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2).       n some cases, fail safe categorization can be a matter of engineering judgment based on high  structural margins, design experience, materials characteristics, overall configuration, etc. If  failure of a part/component is clearly not a catastrophic hazard, the part/component can be  classified during the initial screening as non-fracture critical without further fracture control  assessment. This approach should be coordinated with the RFCA and documented.  redundant structure that is reflown and for on-orbit structure subject to significant fatigue loading  at program prescribed intervals. Reverification may be accomplished by a close visual  inspection (aided by cameras, borescopes, or other assistance if necessary) of the hardware for  signs of damage. If damage is indicated, a more rigorous inspection must be made to establish  fail safe structural integrity. In this case partial disassembly for better visibility may be required,  and NDE inspection or other appropriate evaluation used.    sufficient fatigue capability to reach end of service. The fatigue assessment of the assumed  remaining structure should use concentrated stresses and a factor of 4.0 on total cycles.  5.1.4 Non-Hazardous Leak Before Burst (NHLBB) Pressurized Components. This  Section addresses pressurized hardware that is characterized by benign/safe failure modes.  Appendix G provides a flow diagram to identify various types of pressurized hardware.  Pressurized components/systems whose only credible failure mode at the Maximum Design  Pressure (MDP), due to the presence of a flaw, is development of a non-hazardous leak (as  opposed to catastrophic fragmentation or abrupt rupture), are inherently characterized as a  benign/safe failure. This hardware may be classified as NHLBB, provided that slow release of  the fluid contents is not a catastrophic hazard. Catastrophic hazards to be considered in this  assessment include unacceptable dilution or toxicity of breathing environment, increases in  oxygen or flammable fluids beyond flammability limits, loss of a safety critical function, etc.    ven if NHLBB cannot be achieved, leak before burst (LBB) is the preferred design practice,  because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than  one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for components that will have safe  life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.  bellows, etc. are accepted as NHLBB designs and they can be classified as non-fracture critical  provided all of the following are met:   NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   include loss of a safety critical function, dangerous environmental changes such as  unacceptable oxygen content, creation of explosive mixtures, dangerous toxicity, etc.     d. They are made of typical materials per applicable piping codes or space flight  hardware requirements. Typical materials in this category include stainless steels, aluminum,  and Inconel.  e. The critical flaw size at the MDP is a through flaw at least 10 times the thickness in  length. The analyst should make sure that any actual through cracks in the hardware will be  less than 10t in length when this check is made. Otherwise, an actual crack in the hardware  may have grown past 10t potentially leading to an unsafe situation.  f. Leak is automatically detected and further pressure cycling is prevented or there is no  repressurization. If the item can experience continued crack growth after leak, it must be safe  life against burst for crack growth beyond 10t (item d).    necessary condition for NHLBB is that the critical flaw size at the MDP is a through flaw at  least 10 times the thickness in length. A method is given in Appendix C for verifying that this  critical flaw size requirement for cylindrical pressure system components is met. To be  classified NHLBB, hardware must meet the criteria given on the appropriate check sheet in  Appendix H.   5.1.5 Non-Fracture Critical Rotating Machinery. This Section addresses rotating  machinery that does not possess sufficient energy or momentum to present a catastrophic  hazard risk and should not be classified as fracture critical (see Section 5.2.2.). Low energy and  low momentum rotating equipment should be examined for protection against a catastrophic  occurrence resulting from released masses in the event of failure. Rotating equipment, whose  failure could be catastrophic, must be shown to be contained, or assurance that failure will not  occur because of an existing flaw must be demonstrated. The mounts for rotating machinery  must be addressed as standard structure and assessed for fracture criticality.  n general, rotation of less than 500 rpm (low speed) of small devices is accepted as non-  fracture critical based on their associated low energy and low momentum. Shrouded or  enclosed fans (8000 rpm and 8 inch diameter maximum), electric motors, shafts, gearboxes,  recorders, conventional pumps (including roughing pumps), and similar devices are accepted as  inherently meeting containment requirements, or the full intent of requirements, and can be  classified non-fracture critical without further assessment during initial screening. The effect of  rotating equipment failure on the functionality of associated hardware is not a factor in  classification for fracture control unless a catastrophic hazard is a direct result. In that case the  rotating device must be classified fracture critical.       Analyses (see Appendix B) or tests must be carried out where there is uncertainty regarding  containment of fragmented pieces. Where containment cannot be assured, or failure results in  a catastrophic hazard, the device must be treated in accordance with applicable criteria in  Section 5.2.2 for fracture critical rotating machinery.  aving a kinetic energy of less than 14,240 foot pounds does not imply that the device is non-  fracture critical. See Appendix K for an example of high momentum rotating hardware that is  fracture critical but has less kinetic energy than 14,240 foot pounds.   clearly not be a catastrophic hazard, or a group of fasteners or pins where loss of any one  fastener or pin would clearly not result in a catastrophic hazard, can be classified as non-  fracture critical (by inspection) during initial screening. These fasteners must clearly and  obviously meet the requirements of Sections 5.1.1, or 5.1.2, or 5.1.3, and be classified  accordingly. In cases where the classification is not obvious, analysis or test is required to  support the disposition. See Appendix E for additional guidelines for classifying parts.  verification and quality assurance requirements only. Fracture control for safe life rivets is  impractical and not realistically implemented.    not lend themselves to conventional fracture control methodology and high quality must be  relied on for assured performance. Such devices are non-fracture critical by exemption.   amenable to conventional fracture control methodology. However, as with other structures, if  structural failure of a composite/bonded part can be shown to be fail safe (Section 5.1.3), and  potential single failure mass release meets low released mass requirements (Section 5.1.1), or  is contained (Section 5.1.2), the part can be classified non-fracture critical. Additionally, parts  can be classified non-fracture critical when it can be shown that the strain level at limit load is  less than the damage tolerant threshold strain level. The strain level approach, or alternate  approaches, must be coordinated with the RFCA prior to implementation. Note that composite  structures require proof testing for structural strength reasons (see Applicable Document 7 and  Reference Documents 23, and 24).  5.1.8 Glass. Broken glass pieces larger than 50 microns are unacceptable in habitable  volumes, and therefore must be contained to be non-fracture critical. In uninhabited volumes,  glass must be low released mass or contained to be non-fracture critical. When determining  released mass, it can be assumed that glass parts, such as mirrors or lenses will break into  releasable pieces no larger than 1/3 of original size. Camera lenses and similar pieces that are  recessed or protected during non-use periods are considered protected glass and may be  classified non-fracture critical.

Sealed containers that are  NHLBB (i.e., critical length of through crack is at least 10 times the wall thickness, any existing  through flaws are less than 10t, and fluid release would not create a catastrophic hazard) may  be classified as low risk and therefore non-fracture critical if the container supports meet  fracture control requirements and the container complies with both of the following:     If pressurized to 1.5 atmospheres or less, the containers are acceptable. If  pressurized to more than 1.5 atmospheres, an analysis must show that the safety  factor is 2.5 or greater or the container must be proof-tested to a minimum of 1.5  times the MDP.   The container supports may or may not require NDE depending on their individual fracture  control classification.  n special cases, containers with pressure or contained energy exceeding the limits given in the  definitions may be acceptable, but these containers must be specifically approved by the RFCA  and by the PSRP. At a minimum, an analysis must show the ultimate safety factor is 2.5 or  greater, and that the container is an NHLBB design. In addition, the container must be proof-  tested to a minimum of 1.5 times the MDP.

It is expected that batteries and battery systems will be built to existing  requirements and guidelines for flight applications (JSC 20793) thereby providing basic  assurance for battery safety. If batteries and/or their applications still generate a safety concern  because of credible, potentially destructive pressure build-up or possible release of a product  that would be a catastrophic hazard, they should be assessed using fracture control  methodology. Battery cells and cases (battery boxes) should be assessed as unique  pressurized hardware or containers. Battery cells must be examined for structural failure mode  at design operating conditions and for hazard category if contents are released. Sealed battery  cases (containers of battery cells), if used, must be given similar evaluation.   includes Ni-H batteries because of the relative small amounts of released hydrogen that would  be involved. Battery cells that are not NHLBB or whose open release of contents would be a  catastrophic hazard can be classified non-fracture critical if the respective failures would be  suitably contained by a battery case, or by levels of containment as specified in NSTS 1700.7B,  section 209.1b, including absorbent layers. Small batteries in common use, such as button cells               NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  of 200 milliamp-hours or less and carbon-zinc or zinc-air batteries of size \u201cF\u201d or smaller are  exempt from fracture control.  5.1.12 Low Risk Part. This Section addresses parts that can be classified non-fracture  critical because of large structural margins and other considerations that make failure from a  pre-existing flaw extremely unlikely. Classification of parts in this category should be  coordinated with the RFCA for approval. For a general part to be classified low risk it must meet  5.1.12.1 and 5.1.12.2 below; Limitations on Applicability, and Inherent Assurance Against  Failure From a Crack-Like Flaw. Fasteners and shear pins need only meet item 5.1.12.3.  Check sheets are included in Appendix H to assist the analyst in determining low risk for  general parts and fasteners.    5.1.12.1 Limitations on Applicability. The part must be all metal and for aluminum parts  the primary load path should not be in the short transverse direction if this dimension is greater  than three inches. It must not be the pressure shell of a human-tended module or personnel  compartment, pressure vessel, or pressurized component in a pressurized system containing a  hazardous fluid. Rotating machinery must operate below the energy limit set for the automatic  classification as fracture critical (Section 5.2.2). A part whose failure will directly result in a  catastrophic hazard is also excluded, except when the total (unconcentrated) tensile stresses in  the part at limit load are no greater than 30 percent of the ultimate tensile strength for the metal  used and all other requirements for low risk classification are met.   part must possess inherent assurance against catastrophic failure from a crack-like flaw by  compliance with a. and b. below:     stress corrosion cracking as defined in MSFC-STD-3029, or MSFC-HDBK-527/JSC 09604. If  other than Table I or A-rated materials as classified respectively in these documents must be  used, suitability for the specific application must be documented by a Materials Usage  Agreement (MUA) approved by the proper authority. MUA forms contained in the cited  documents, or equivalent, must be used.  (2) The part must not be fabricated using a process that has a significant probability of  introducing cracks (including welding, custom forging, casting, or quenching heat treatments on  materials sensitive to quench cracking) unless specific NDE or testing, which has been  approved by the RFCA, is applied to sufficiently screen for cracks. It can be assumed that  significant crack-like defects do not occur for standard forgings or during machining of standard  forgings, sheet, bar, extrusions, or plate products that are produced in accordance with  aerospace quality specifications and are known to have good machinability properties. All parts  must have a material property ratio of KIc/Fty > 0.33 in1/2 (1.66 mm1/2). With the approval of the  RFCA, the effect of material thickness on K value may be considered, and the KIe value may be  used in lieu of KIc if it is known for a specific application.           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  (3) Parts classified as low risk fracture parts may be accepted using normally applied  methods that ensure aerospace quality flight hardware. At a minimum, these parts must receive  a visual inspection for surface defects. Defects that could affect part life are cause for rejection.  Inspections should be made on individual parts prior to assembly to maximize accessibility for  inspection.          High margin can be shown by a maximum tensile stress that will not  exceed the endurance limit or Smax < Ftu/(4{1-0.5 R}), where Smax  is the local concentrated stress, and R is the ratio of minimum stress  to maximum stress in a fatigue cycle.   accounts for the effects of notches and mean stress and which  shows a minimum of four complete service lives with a safety factor  of 1.5 on alternating stress.    an analysis predicts that credible initial flaws caused by handling, machining, assembly or  testing will not propagate to failure in four complete service lives. The analysis must assume  surface cracks of 0.025 inch (0.63 mm.) depth by 0.05 inch (1.25 mm.) length and corner cracks  of 0.025 inch (0.63 mm.) radius.    a. Fastener is in a local pattern of two or more similar fasteners.  b. Fastener and joint are of conventional design and within Shuttle or ISS experience base.  c. Be high-quality military standard, national aircraft standard, or equivalent commercial  fasteners or pins that are fabricated and inspected in accordance with aerospace-type  specifications.  d. Fasteners used in multi-cycle tension loaded application must have rolled threads.  e. Be fabricated from well-characterized metal not sensitive to stress corrosion cracking.  If used in tension application is not made from a low toughness alloy as defined in  f.   Section 5.1.1 or specifically, Ti-6Al-4V STA titanium.  g. Fastener meets appropriate preload, and stress requirements with no joint gapping  (gapping is allowed under fail safe and/or emergency conditions). Bolted joint analysis  criteria may be found in NSTS 08307 and factors of safety in NASA-STD-5001.  h. Have positive back-off prevention consistent with their criticality. Back-off prevention                                                    5.2 Fracture Critical Parts/Components. This Section provides criteria for classifying  and assessing specific types of fracture critical hardware. In addition to the requirements in this  section, fracture critical parts must meet the general safe life requirements in Section 6. unless  specifically stated otherwise.  5.2.1 Pressure Vessels and Pressurized Components. All pressure vessels, and all  pressurized hardware that contains hazardous fluids, must be classified fracture critical. See the  flow diagram in Appendix G for assistance in understanding the various categories of  pressurized hardware.  t is preferred design practice to make pressurized hardware LBB, because hardware that can  tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than one that cannot. If the hardware  is LBB and leak is hazardous (catastrophic), the hardware must be safe life against leak;  otherwise, it must be safe life against burst.         must be shown to be safe life by fracture mechanics analysis combined with appropriate  inspections or tests. They must also comply with the requirements of Applicable Documents 2  and 3 and Sections 4 and 5 of Reference 15. Sections 4 and 5 of Reference 15 may be  replaced by Reference 13. The analyst should make the following modifications in applying the  referenced requirements:  The low risk approach provides the analyst with a method for assessing fastener patterns  without doing a fail safe analysis. The check sheet in Appendix H provides a method of  documenting the required low risk criteria.      inspected after acceptance proof testing (See Appendix I and Section 6.3.1) in addition to  inspections that may have been performed prior to acceptance tests.       For low cycle applications (< 50 pressure cycles), a proof test of each flight vessel to  a minimum of 1.5 times MDP and a fatigue analysis showing the greater of 500 pressure cycles  or 10 lifetimes may be used in lieu of testing a qualification vessel. This option may be used  when the pressure vessel can be verified as otherwise compliant with the requirements of NSTS  1700.7 and MIL-STD-1522A, Approach A.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   NHLBB check sheet in Appendix H, are acceptable without a safe life assessment for burst  when all other requirements are met. If fracture mechanics data are not available, or if reliable  conservative estimates of properties cannot be made, a vessel test may be conducted to verify  the NHLBB capability with the approval of the RFCA.  5.2.1.2 Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs). COPVs must meet the  intent of Reference 14. A damage prevention plan must be developed for the overwrapped  pressure vessel(s) and be made a part of the hardware data package. A stress rupture life  assessment is required for each COPV. The analyst should make the following modifications in  applying Reference 14:    5.2.1.3 Lines Fittings and Other Pressurized Components. Lines, fittings, and other  pressurized components (equipment that is part of a pressurized system including valves, filters,  regulators, heat pipes, heat exchangers, etc.) are to be considered fracture critical if they  contain hazardous fluids or if loss of pressurization would result in a catastrophic hazard. All  fusion joints in fracture critical systems must be 100 percent inspected using a qualified NDE  method(s) that will determine the presence of unacceptable lack of penetration or other  unacceptable conditions both on the surface and within the weldment. Unless impractical,  inspection of fracture critical fusion joints must be made after proof testing, and for lines and  fittings after proof test of the final assembly. In instances where NDE is not feasible, or is  incapable of being dealt with successfully, a process control program that demonstrably assures  the quality of the uninspectable welds may be employed. An example of the requirements for  such a program along with its supporting rationale is given in Section 5.2.1.4 below.  Concurrence of the RFCA is required where full NDE is not considered practical. Any type of  flaw indication in the final product that does not meet specification requirements will be cause  for rejection. In addition to proof testing of parts during individual acceptance, the complete  pressure system must also be proof-tested and leak-checked to demonstrate system integrity.  Safe life analysis is not required for fracture-critical lines, fittings, and other pressurized  components, which are proof-tested to a minimum of 1.5 times the MDP and meet the safety  factor requirements of NSTS 1700.7.   by Process Control. As stated above, there may be cases where NDE of the welds in fracture  critical pressurized components is not practical. In this case, process control with sufficient  rationale may be used to accept the welds. This rationale should be submitted to the RFCA for  approval. An example of acceptable rationale with points for consideration is given below.          NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   o Component design intent (design life and usage)  o List specific part/serial numbers covered by this rationale  o Provide brief mechanical description (dimensions, materials, construction)  o List consequences of failure for each component  \uf0a7 Substances leaked, quantities  \uf0a7 Mitigating factors against leak occurring  \uf0a7 Safeguards in place to detect or contain leak   \uf0a7 Nominal, Maximum Design, and Proof  \uf0a7 Provide clear definitions or derivations for each pressure     o Material controls and NDE of material raw stock  o Welding processes, qualification, number of unique processes, filler metal  o Weld inspection acceptance criteria  \uf0a7 Cross-section quality  \uf0a7 Visual inspection methods  \uf0a7 Criteria for each type of weld: inner diameter, outer diameter, flange   \uf0a7 Justification for proposed number of samples  \uf0a7 Overview of sampling for each unique weld process   \uf0b7 Component Testing  o Leak Testing     \uf0b7 Pressure, cycles, environment  \uf0b7 Relate test pressure and cycles to actual flight use  \uf0a7 Highlights of qualification test procedure (proof tests, leak checks)  \uf0a7 Provide rationale for qualification by similarity, if used   \uf0a7 Tabularize proof pressures and their derivation  \uf0a7 Outline proof test procedure, individual and system level    independent samples provides statistical significance comparable to an approved NDE process.  If there are impediments which make this level of sampling impossible to achieve, technical  rationale must be given to support a lesser sampling plan. The component qualification tests  must include all environmental effects and pressures that the hardware will experience during its                NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  usage. The effect of any environmental exposure should be accounted for during the  qualification testing, including long duration exposure effects. In addition, the pressures used for  qualification testing must account for all possible conditions occurring during the lifetime of the  component. Finally, the program may wish to consider extending qualification cycle testing  beyond the required factor of four (4) to demonstrate design margin past minimum requirements.  n addition to other requirements for fracture-critical components, rotating machinery that has a  kinetic energy of 14,240 foot-pounds or greater must be proof tested (spin-tested) and must be  subjected to NDE before and after proof testing. If NDE after proof testing is not practical, then  the rotating part must be contained, and loss of function must not be safety critical, or it must be  shown that the proof test adequately screens for flaws (see Section 6.3.2). Proof test to screen  for flaws requires RFCA approval. The proof test level must be greater than or equal to the  level derived by fracture mechanics analysis or the level required by normal acceptance test.   components if structural failure of them due to crack propagation can cause a catastrophic  hazard. Appendix K shows an example of a rotating device that has less kinetic energy than  stated above, but has significant rotational momentum and fracture critical parts. The parts are  classified fracture critical because they have credible structural failure modes due to crack  propagation that may cause sudden jamming and stoppage of the rotor generating loads that  could result in a catastrophic hazard.     fail safe, or low risk. Potential catastrophe because of a single fastener failure should be  avoided. Fasteners that do not comply with the various non-fracture critical criteria applicable to  fasteners in Section 5.1 must be classified fracture critical.   A286 steel, Inconel 718, MP35N alloy or similarly tough and environmentally compatible alloys.  They must also meet items c. through i. of the low risk criteria in Section 5.1.12.3. In addition,  fasteners less than 3/16 inch (0.48 cm.) diameter should generally be avoided for a fracture  critical application. If use is unavoidable, specific fracture control methodology must be  coordinated with the RFCA.   assessed for safe life. Preload and its effect on flaws and cyclic stresses must be considered in  the safe life assessment. All safe life fasteners must be inspected by an acceptable NDE  technique or must be proof tested to screen for flaws. Safe life analysis must assume a flaw in  the thread root of a size consistent with NDE sensitivity or proof test level. Acceptable NDE flaw  sizes are given in the NASGRO\uf0d2 manual (Reference 19).   for shear loading where bending stresses are present must also be assessed for safe life and  examined for crack-like flaws.     Pins, tangs, and/or lock wire used for assurance against fastener back-off, nuts, threaded  inserts, and any similar fastener parts must be of high quality when used in a fracture critical  fastener application. These items are not classified as fracture critical and are exempt from  fracture control, but it is required that high quality aerospace hardware be used with  commensurate specifications and installation procedures.  nserts used in conjunction with fracture critical fasteners must be proof load tested to a  minimum factor of 1.2 after installation. This would include, for example, inserts bonded or  potted into composite and sandwich structures as well as inserts installed into aluminum  structures. Note that composite structures require additional considerations as given in Section  5.2.4. Because of the unique materials, loading conditions, configurations, sizes, and/or stress  distributions, a safe life analysis of inserts is not feasible. Installation of fracture critical  fasteners that rely on preload for structural performance, such as joint stability, control of fatigue  stress range, etc., must employ appropriate proven methods to accurately apply required  preloads.   that will keep them isolated from other fasteners. The methodology given in NSTS 08307  should be used in calculating the preload in a fracture critical fastener.   techniques of containment and fail safe assessment, use of threshold strain levels for damage  tolerance, verification of structural integrity through analysis and testing, manufacturing process  controls, and nondestructive inspection.   Document 7 and References 23 and 24, all of which require that a proof test of the flight article  be done in addition to specific quality control of all structure in the primary load path. Given that  a proof test must be done, option \u201c1\u201d below is the more efficient fracture control approach. A  sandwich structure composed of metal parts bonded together is considered to be a bonded  structure.  he payload designer/manufacturer must use only manufacturing processes and controls  (coupon tests, sampling techniques, etc.) that are demonstrated to be reliable and consistent  with established aerospace industry practices for composite/bonded structures. Supporting  data must be available to verify that as-built flight articles satisfy design and analysis  assumptions, models, and all technical requirements. Test articles must be designed and  fabricated to the same requirements, drawings, and specifications as the flight article.  fracture control screening criteria listed in Section 5.1.7) must be shown to meet fracture control  requirements by one of the following methods:   1. A proof test (static or dynamic) to no less than 120 percent of the limit load. The proof  test must be conducted on the flight article. The test may be accomplished at the component or  subassembly level if the loads on the test article duplicate those that would be seen in a fully  assembled test article. Caution should be exercised when testing the flight article to 1.20 to  prevent detrimental yielding to the metallic fittings and fasteners in the flight assembly and  damage to the composite. Test loads on the composite should not exceed 80 percent of  ultimate A basis strength.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   service lives. These tests must be conducted on full-scale, flight-like elements of critical  components and samples with controlled flaws or damage. The size and shape of the flaws or  damage must correspond to the detection capability of the NDE to be imposed on the flight part.  The type of flaws and damage considered must be representative of that which could occur on  the flight part.  n particular cases where the above requirements cannot be met, flight hardware may be  approved for fracture control based on special considerations. These special considerations  include a formal quality control program and demonstrated past experience. Specifically, it must  be shown that the manufacturer of the composite article has a successful history of building a  similar design, certified and controlled process specifications are used, personnel are properly  trained and certified, and proposed nondestructive testing techniques are adequate to validate  the quality and integrity of the hardware. This information must be provided to the PSRP and  documented in the fracture control summary report. The RFCA must approve use of this option.  or all fracture-critical composite/bonded components, procedures to prevent damage resulting  from handling or final assembly must be addressed in the fracture control plan and approved by  the RFCA.     pressures, must be analyzed for degradation from static fatigue. This analysis must include an  evaluation of flaw growth under the conditions of limit stresses and actual environments. Since  moisture contributes to flaw growth in glass, flaw growth calculations will be based on average  flaw growth properties derived for 100 percent moisture. The life prediction will be based on KIc  nominal minus 3-sigma. Also, a factor on stress as given in the Table I below should be used in  the safe life analysis, especially for short lives. This stress factor (in addition to the required  service life factor of 4) is necessary due to the extreme flaw growth velocity sensitivity to small  variations in the stress intensity. The stress factor may be conservatively set to 1.4 for all  analysis lives (as in NASA-STD 5003).   Analysis Life  \uf0a3\uf020week  > week and \uf0a3\uf020month  > month and \uf0a3\uf020year  > year  1.4  1.3  1.2  1.1   those assumed in the fracture mechanics analysis. The proof test will be conducted in an  environment that does not promote flaw growth. Proof stress will be based on KIc nominal plus  1-sigma. If stresses are low with respect to test-verified allowables and a factor of safety of 5 or  greater can be shown, a proof test is not required. The appropriate analysis should be  submitted in lieu of test results.            Visual inspection at 10X magnification and lighting at right angles to critical flaw orientations  should be done post proof for fracture critical glass. It is prudent to also do this inspection prior  to proof to preclude losing an expensive piece of hardware during proof. A visual inspection  should be done even if a proof test is not required.  f approved by the RFCA, small glass parts may be accepted for flight based on preflight  vibration environmental testing that is shown to encompass the launch loads, provided that the  part also passes visual (10X) or functional test that verify the glass integrity. These items may  include lamps, small scopes, visual aids, displays, mirrors, etc. This hardware is safe life by  test. In the absence of such a test (or normal safe life assessment), glass in a habitable volume  must be contained and verifiable as unbroken prior to crew exposure.  he reader is also referred to SSP 30560 for a discussion on glass fracture control for space  station. In addition, the NASGRO\uf0d2 manual has a Section on flaw growth of glass along with  material properties including mean and standard deviations on fracture toughness for various  glass materials.   for performing a function where failure to perform the function would result in a catastrophic  hazard, or a tool/mechanism whose failure during use would, in itself, result in a catastrophic  hazard, must be classified fracture critical. This classification includes safety critical tethers.  Structural parts of fracture critical tools and mechanisms must be treated in the same general  manner as structure, including classification as low risk fracture parts where appropriate.   of mechanisms are not subjected to large numbers of high stress cycles which would tend to  grow small flaws. In these cases, it is only necessary to assure that tools and working parts of  fracture critical mechanisms are of good quality and capable of responding to maximum applied  loads during use without failure via normal strength analysis. Fatigue rated springs should be  used for fracture critical spring application when large numbers of spring cycles are required.  This quality option, which does not require safe life analysis, must be coordinated with the  RFCA. These mechanism parts would be classified safe life/quality option.   that defects, which could cause failure during use, are not present. Fracture critical tools/  mechanisms must, as applicable, also be assessed for compliance with the requirements of  Sections 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 during launch and landing.   fracture critical and assured acceptable by compliance with fracture control procedures for  pressure vessels or hazardous fluid containers.  5.2.8 Sealed Containers. Sealed containers that are not NHLBB designs will be classified  fracture critical. Flaws must be screened by a proof test or suitable NDE inspection for safe life  analysis.   rupture or leak when release of a fluid would cause a catastrophic hazard. Such containers  must be treated and certified the same as pressure vessels when the contained fluid has a delta  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005         NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  pressure greater than one atmosphere. When approved by the RFCA, an optional approach  may be used for metallic or non-metallic containers (including those with a differential pressure  of less than one atmosphere). Containers using this optional approach must have a minimum  safety factor of 2.5 times MDP and must meet the fracture control requirements for pressurized  components given in 5.2.1. When a proof test to a minimum factor of 1.5 is impractical, safe life  must be assured by appropriate NDE applications and flaw growth analysis. Integrity against  leak must be verified by test at 1.0 times MDP.   life must be classified as fracture critical. Typically, these enclosures must be shown to be safe  life designs against burst.  t is important to note that a habitable module, for which the CFS is a through flaw of length at  least 10t, is not classified as NHLBB, because pressure must be maintained. The continued  pressure cycling due to the \u201cmake up\u201d air can grow the crack, so the module will require safe life  classification and post proof inspection. Even in cases where NHLBB cannot be achieved, LBB  is the preferred design practice, because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without  rupture is inherently safer than one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for  components that will have safe life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.   hose parts/components identified as fracture critical must be shown to be safe life (safe life  and damage tolerant are synonymous and interchangeable) by analysis or test. The safe life  demonstration is based on an initial flaw size that could be present in the part. This flaw size is  established by nondestructive evaluation (NDE) or by proof testing. Analysis or test must  consider all significant loadings, both cyclic and sustained, that the part will experience during  ground and flight phases. Loads from these phases must be considered for each mission the  hardware will be flown. The total of all significant loading events and environments comprise  one service life (see definitions for safe life, service life, and service life factor). Safe life parts  must be shown to have a service life factor of at least four (4). If four is not achieved, the part  should be redesigned or a more sensitive inspection technique employed. Special inspection  techniques must be approved by the RFCA (see Section 6.3.1). If feasible, the life requirement  can be reduced (limited life) and the part replaced or reinspected when available life is used. If  \u201climited life\u201d parts are to be employed, project management must be informed, and it must be  determined whether replacement of the part or reverification of safe life is feasible, e.g., the part  must be accessible.     critical area and orientation for that part. The size of the flaw must be based on either the  appropriate NDE techniques (6.3.1) or on proof testing (6.3.2). Appendix F, Table F-I (or F-II),  lists flaw sizes representative of the capabilities of commonly used NDE techniques for  geometries shown in Figure F-1. For surface cracks in components including pressure vessels,  both sets of values for \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d given in Table F-I (or F-II) must be considered. (Note: When  NASA-STD-5009 is released, it should replace Appendix F).     To show that an NDE-inspected part meets safe life requirements, the analyst should select the  appropriate inspection technique from Table F-I (or F-II) and use the listed minimum initial flaw  sizes in analyses to show that the part will survive at least four service lives.  ontributions to crack growth (life), such as environmental effects and material orientation must  be included in the analysis. For sustained stresses, it must be shown that the maximum stress-  intensity factor in the fatigue cycle, KMAX is less than the stress intensity factor for environment  1.

The analyst is encouraged to  study the user\u2019s manual, which provides a good overview of safe life analysis.  6.1.1 Safe Life Analysis Involving Holes. For components where it is necessary to  consider the propagation of a crack into a hole, or from one hole to another hole, analysis must  assume that the crack is not arrested or retarded by the hole but continues on past the hole.  The hole must be treated as a crack.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     1. KEAC is often denoted KIscc in the literature.

General considerations and comments on the effects of service environment,  product form, material orientation, and material processing on fracture properties are discussed  below.   selection is to consider whether or not fracture properties are available for the material.  Generating fracture data can be costly in terms of time and money; so, given the choice  between two equally suitable materials, consideration should be given to whether or not fracture  properties are available. Conversely, selection of a material should not be made simply  because fracture properties are available. Clearly, material selection must be made on the  basis of the suitability of the material for the application \u2013 just because a material is in the  fracture database doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily the best material to use.                                     A general screening criterion for materials selection is to select a material with a plane strain  fracture toughness to yield strength ratio greater than 0.33 \uf0d6in (KIc/Fty > 0.33 \uf0d6in). While this is  not a mandatory requirement for all fracture critical parts, it is a good practice for material  selection. This is a requirement, however, for materials in parts that are to be classified as low  risk (see Section 5.1.12) and fasteners to be classified as low mass (see Section 5.1.1).  Another general point to consider is that toughness tends to decrease with increase in strength  and tends to increase with an increase in ductility. Both strength and ductility parameters are  important and must be considered together. For example, for a given material, a process that  results in a higher strength, but lower ductility may result in a lower toughness, depending on  the extent of the loss of ductility. Although not an explicit fracture control requirement, a good  general practice is to maintain a minimum of 3% elongation (in 4 or 5 diameters gage length) in  the service environment. Factors affecting ductility include temperature, material orientation and  environmental exposure. With respect to temperature, particular attention should be given to  the ductile-to-brittle transition temperatures for materials (particularly high strength steels) to  ensure operational environments do not fall below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature for  the material. With respect to material orientation, some materials may have adequate ductility  in primary orientations and have significantly less ductility in the short-transverse (through  thickness) orientation. This is particularly noticeable in aluminum structures machined from  thick plate product. Reductions in ductility in the short-transverse direction may be as high as  70%. As a general guideline, in components fabricated from aluminum plate products greater  than three (3) inches in thickness, S-T material properties should be verified if material property  data for the S-T orientation are not available. With respect to environmental exposure, other  potential causes of low ductility to be considered are environmental embrittlement such as  hydrogen exposure in service or due to plating operations, liquid metal embrittlement, and  exposure to corrosive environments.  6.1.2.1.2 Service Environment. Environmental factors such as temperature and exposure  to harmful media can affect fracture properties. Clearly, material properties that are compatible  with the operating environment are necessary for accurate analysis. Literature reviews,  handbooks, test data and experience can be used to evaluate material susceptibility in specific  environments. With respect to environmental exposure, a general requirement is the use of  materials with a high resistance to stress corrosion cracking, as defined in MSFC-STD-3029 or  MSFC-HDBK-527/JSC 09604. A material not rated with a high resistance to stress corrosion  cracking requires an approved Materials Usage Agreement (MUA). MUA(s), if required, must  document the suitability of the alloy for the specific application and must be included in the  FCSR. For payloads approved by the PSRP a copy of the MUA(s) must also be attached to the  appropriate hazard report. MUA(s) must be processed using the forms cited in the applicable  documents.  environments and should not be used as a blanket measure of material performance in all  environments. Materials must be assessed for specific environmental exposure such as  hydrogen embrittlement, liquid metal embrittlement, NaCl environments, environmental gases,  corrosive media, compatibility with contained fluids, and any environment where related  problems could result in a catastrophic hazard. Also note that data in MSFC-STD-3029 is  based on performance of smooth or notched test samples. Test data on stress intensity  thresholds for environment assisted cracking (KEAC) are not provided. Fracture properties that  are relevant (or conservative) to the service environment must be used. Plans to address  material performance in specific environments should be addressed in the fracture control plan.   NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  The effects of service temperature on fracture toughness as well as crack growth rate properties  should also be considered. Excursions from the service temperature as well as the sustained  operating temperature can affect fracture performance of the material and should be factored  into the characterization of the material as needed. For example, an aluminum part that  nominally operates at room temperature but experiences brief but periodic service cycles at  temperatures near the aging temperature of the material can experience significant degradation  of fracture properties during its service life.   form. Plate, sheet, forgings, extrusions, and castings for the same alloy will generally exhibit  enough variation in properties to warrant data for each product form. In general, castings will  exhibit lower properties and more variability than wrought material and need to be carefully  considered. Plate material can also exhibit variability in toughness with product thickness and  location within the thickness. This can be influenced metallurgically by factors such as through  hardenability in steels, and the effectiveness of cold working in aluminums. Variability with  thickness is also associated with the degree of constraint at the crack front. Therefore, care  should be taken to ensure that specimens used to determine toughness for a given plate  thickness are representative of the plate thickness of the raw stock used to manufacture the  hardware, the location within the thickness for thick plate products, and are representative (or  conservative) with respect to the constraint conditions present in the hardware. For example, if  a thin structural membrane is machined from the center of a thick plate, then fracture properties  for specimens machined from the center of thick plate product should be used in the analysis.   omposite and nonmetallic materials must also be screened for fracture control. Fracture  critical parts constructed of composites, nonmetallics, metal matrix materials, ceramic matrix  materials, honeycomb structures, polymers, glass, plastics, etc., require disposition and  analysis. Typically, fracture control assessment of components constructed of these  components requires empirical approaches; commonly in the form of residual life testing that  demonstrates tolerance to defects.  are used in fracture critical parts requiring safe-life analysis. These properties should be  representative of the process and geometry used in the hardware.  6.1.2.1.4 Material Orientation. Fracture properties can vary with grain orientation,  depending on the degree of anisotropy in the material. In general, for thin plate products, T-L  properties (specimen loaded in the transverse direction with the crack growing in the  longitudinal direction) will be the lowest. However, off axis properties, such as those at 45  degrees to the rolling direction, sometimes exhibit the lowest fracture toughness. This should  be evaluated in materials where anisotropic behavior is noted. In thick plate products, S-T  properties are generally the lowest. This is particularly true in thick plate aluminum. As a  general rule, in components fabricated from aluminum plate products greater than 3 inches in  thickness, S-T material properties should be verified if material property data for the S-T  orientation are not available. Properties of the weakest material orientation should be used in  the life and strength analysis unless material orientation is fully traceable throughout the design  and manufacturing process.   and strength properties. Within a given alloy many processing factors can directly affect  mechanical behavior. Heat treatment, cold working, and plating are common influences. For  example, 7075 aluminum, heat treated in the T6 condition has a low resistance to stress     NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  corrosion cracking; whereas, if it is heat treated to the T73 condition it has a high resistance to  stress corrosion cracking, resulting in large differences in the critical fracture toughness  threshold for environment assisted cracking (KEAC) values for the materials. Similarly, fracture  toughness of precipitation-hardened stainless steels varies significantly with the temper  condition. It is important to ensure that fracture data is matched to the material process  condition of the alloy.     critical parts, the assumed fracture toughness values for predicting crack instability should be  average or typical values. More conservative values may be used. Fracture properties should  be obtained from NASGRO\uf0d2. Use of properties outside the NASGRO\uf0d2 database should be  coordinated with the RFCA. The use of properties outside the NASGRO\uf0d2 database typically  requires supporting test data or literature references.    product form, thickness, and constraint condition. Note that thin parts machined from thick  product forms exhibiting lower toughness and ductility may not provide the assumed Kc  enhancements based on thickness alone. Also, the constraint conditions associated with test  data to determine Kc values may not be consistent with the component. The NASGRO\uf0d2  materials database generally sets Bk, a NASGRO\uf0d2\uf020\uf020fitting parameter, to a value in the range  0.5- 1.0 resulting in significant enhancements to KIc that are not always supported by test data.  Reference 19 (section 2.1.4) cautions against using these enhanced toughness values,  especially in high stress/low cycle fatigue applications. Additionally, the appropriate use of non-  zero Bk values requires understanding of the constraint condition for the crack, which is a  function of stress state and geometry. As a result of these observations, the RFCA for some  NASA Centers such as MSFC and ARC requires that Bk be set to zero in NASGRO\uf0d2 analysis  unless specific data is available to justify a non-zero value.   vessel applications, the lower bound values of KEAC for the relevant fluid and material  combinations must be used in fracture mechanics analysis.    toughness testing of actual representative material may be required for fracture critical parts  whose failure clearly results in a catastrophic occurrence and are fabricated from an alloy  having a wide range of fracture toughness for the particular fabrication and heat treatment  process used. This consideration is necessary since the required service life factor (a minimum  of four) may not envelope materials with wide variations in fracture toughness. As a general  guideline, a wide range in fracture toughness may be defined as material exhibiting a range of  fracture data with values falling below 20% of the average value. In these cases, samples from  material out of the same heat lot or out of remnant material used in fabrication of the part should  be considered for testing. Assessment of components that fall in this category should be  coordinated with the RFCA.       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005    is explicitly required for components with less than 1000 cycle lives when an assumed lower  bound value of fracture toughness results in an inadequate safe life. This provision is required  since safe life parts with analytical lives less than 1000 cycles typically have a significant portion  of their life in the steep crack growth rate portion (Region III) of the crack growth rate curve.  Deviations between typical test data and actual material performance in low cycle count  scenarios might not be conservatively covered by the required service life factor (a minimum of  four). Test data from representative material are needed in these cases to ensure that  appropriate toughness and crack growth parameters are used in the safe life analysis.  Assessment of components that fall in this category should be coordinated with the RFCA.    documented lower bound toughness values and upper bound crack growth parameters. As  noted above, these components typically have a significant portion of their life in the steep crack  growth rate portion (Region III) of the crack growth rate curve. Test data are generally sparse  and scattered in this region and the required service life factor may not conservatively envelope  variations between actual and typical toughness/crack growth parameters.    values must be used to calculate the crack size determined by the proof test. NASA-STD-5003,  Section 4.2.3.1.4.d. recommends that upper bound values be determined by multiplying  average values by 1.2. This may be used as an estimate of the upper bound values for  preliminary evaluation purposes, but more realistic values are required to determine the crack  size screened by proof test. The determination of upper bound values typically requires testing  (or supporting test data in the literature). The toughness values used in the proof test  assessment must also be representative of the constraint conditions in the structure, which are  a function of geometry and stress state. Simulation of constraint conditions in the structure may  be accomplished by adjusting the Bk value in NASGRO\uf0d2 (recall that Bk is set to zero for  standard safe life analysis at MSFC and ARC) or employing more sophisticated stress analysis  tools to match the stress state in the vicinity of the crack. Proof test as a screen for initial flaws  must be coordinated with the RFCA.    calculations for the NDE initial flaw size approach. Average fracture toughness values may be  used in crack growth rate equations that model growth rate approaching instability. Where the  fatigue crack growth data sources are particularly sparse, conservative estimates of the growth  rate must be assumed and documented. All crack growth rate data must correspond to the  actual temperature and chemical environments expected or shown conservative with respect to  the actual environments.  \uf0b7 When calculating life for flaws screened by proof test, an end of service life fracture  toughness value consistent with the toughness value used in determining the flaw screened by  the proof test should be used. Note if the proof test environment is different from the service  environment, that there will likely be differences between the critical toughness value used for  the proof test analysis and the critical toughness value used in the service life analysis.  However, it is important to maintain a consistent methodology for determining toughness. For  example, suppose a pressure vessel will be proof tested at room temperature but will  experience cryogenic service cycles. The test methodology used to determine upper bound  toughness values at room temperature to calculate the flaw screened by a room temperature  proof test should be consistent with the methodology used to determine upper bound toughness  values at the cryogenic service temperature for use in the safe life calculations. In cases where       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  specific data for one temperature is already available, care should be taken that the data is  appropriate for the application and that the corresponding data for the other temperature is  collected in a similar manner. As noted above, average fatigue crack growth rate properties  may be used for crack growth in these calculations provided they correspond to the actual  temperature and chemical environments expected or shown conservative with respect to the  actual environments. Where the fatigue crack growth data sources are particularly sparse,  conservative estimates of the growth rate must be assumed and documented.    provided in Section 6.4. Note that disposition of known cracks should be coordinated with the  RFCA.  \uf0b7  NASGRO\uf0d2 models for crack growth rate and fracture may vary from version to    version and may also vary from equations published in the literature. As such, the material  parameters (C, n, p, q, etc.) also vary and are not generally interchangeable. Modification of  NASGRO\uf0d2 material parameters should be coordinated with the RFCA.      each fracture critical part so that a safe life assessment can be made. The part's load spectrum  should include the load level and the number of cycles or duration for each significant load  during the hardware\u2019s service life. Both cyclic and sustained loads that the part will experience  should be considered. Effects of residual stresses and preloads must be considered. The safe  life assessment is made using this load spectrum and the material properties that correspond to  the environment of each event within the spectrum. The analyst should carefully consider the  part history and planned service when assembling the load spectrum. Typical phases or events  to consider and the types and sources of loads are listed in Table III. Loads from the phases  listed in this Table would be considered, as applicable, for each mission the hardware will be  flown, and for on-orbit loadings for the duration of on-orbit use for ISS payloads. For example, a  multi-mission payload would most likely have only one static strength test. On the other hand,  some payloads or their components may be proof tested, transported, or see significant ground  handling loads between flights. All significant loadings and environments for all missions and  events must be compiled into a service life for the payload or experiment.

Even when these are well defined, one still must determine the load level and  number of cycles for each phase of a mission. Fortunately, help is available in NASGRO\uf0d2 for  building the load spectrum for the shaded portions in Table III. The analyst should see Section  2.2.5.1, Building the Block Cases, and Appendix H, Loading Spectra for Acceptance Vibration  Test of the NASGRO\uf0d2 users manual. Also the analyst will find Appendix E of SSP 52005B  helpful in defining events for assembling load spectra. Appendix D of this document gives the  GSFC equivalent spectrum for the shuttle launch and landing events. The GSFC spectrum is  preferred over the methodology given in Section E.1.1 of SSP 52005B for determining the  number of cycles and their distribution over various load levels for the shuttle launch and  landing events.  1. On-orbit desorption may introduce a loading cycle for composites.  2. Ferry flight in the Shuttle on a Boeing 747 back to KSC following landing at an alternate site.   This landing may be due to an aborted launch or off nominal descent.    fracture mechanics analysis methodologies are not applicable. Safe life testing is also an  acceptable alternative to analyses when the test plan is approved by the RFCA. Safe life  testing must be performed in the operational environment on specimens representative of the  structural design, thickness of the part, and initial defect sizes located at critical locations. If  testing in the operational environment is not feasible, the test level should be adjusted to  account for the effects of the operational environment on the material properties. Tests must  demonstrate the same capabilities as required by analyses.                                                                                                                                                       that preexisting flaws in the hardware are no larger than those assumed as initial flaws in the  safe life analysis. NDE inspections for fracture control must be performed in accordance with  NASA-STD-5009, \u201cNon-Destructive Evaluation Requirements for Fracture Control Programs\u201d.  Inspection sensitivity must be sufficient to screen initial flaws of the size, type, location, and  orientation that are consistent with the safe life analysis. Flaw detection capability for standard  NDE inspection procedures is defined in NASA-STD-5009, (not yet released), and, for  reference, in Appendix F of this handbook. Where conflict may arise, the flaw sizes specified in  NASA-STD-5009 must be used.  ASA-STD-5007 requires that hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance (i.e., not  screening for specific cracks) must receive post proof test NDE at critical welds and other critical  sections. This means that in general all fracture critical welds and other fracture critical parts must  be inspected post proof testing unless the proof test is done to screen for cracks. Exceptions to  this requirement are pressurized lines and fittings, which require that only fracture critical fusion  joints be inspected post proof (Section 5.2.1). Also, pressure vessels of standard design with  smooth membrane and transition areas and that are in the previous experience base require only  that the welds receive post-proof NDE. The NDE approach for other pressure vessels should be  coordinated with the RFCA. For a discussion on the rationale and requirements for post proof  NDE of pressure vessels and habitable modules, see Appendix I.  nspection requirements for fracture control must be determined by the fracture control analyst,  called out on the respective drawings by the project designers, and the actual inspections  certified by quality control.  for standard NDE delineated in NASA-STD-5009, special NDE will be required. The use of  special NDE on fracture critical hardware requires a demonstration of the ability of the operator  and the process to reliably detect the required defect. Testing should be requested by the  program/project immediately upon the identification of a need for special NDE. Cases involving  special NDE should be coordinated with the responsible NDE and quality organization.  Inspectors and the process must be qualified prior to inspection of fracture critical hardware. If  the need has been identified, plans for implementing special NDE should be addressed in the  Fracture Control Plan.   used in safe life assessments without documented rationale and specific approval by the RFCA.  For transparent optical elements such as windows and lenses, visual inspection with 10X or  higher magnification is acceptable for detecting surface and embedded flaws of 0.100 inch  (2.54 mm) length or greater when proper lighting is applied at right angles to the actual flaw  orientation.   f a candidate part (potentially fracture critical) has not been officially classified for fracture  control by the time of drawing sign-off, then appropriate NDE should be required to assure  existence of a baseline NDE status in the event safe life assessment is eventually required.  6.3 Flaw Screening for Fracture Critical Parts. Fracture critical parts must be screened  for flaws by NDE or proof testing. The RFCA approval is required for flaw screening by proof  tests.    NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Sufficient oversight or control of the program must exist to assure that inspections required for  fracture control are accomplished, and are performed in an acceptable manner, i.e., to assure  qualified inspectors, standardized procedures, calibrated test hardware, etc. are used.  6.3.2 Proof Test for Flaw Screening. The use of proof testing to screen a ductile metallic  component for cracks is discouraged. Instead, a fracture control program should rely primarily  on NDE for these materials.    \u201cBoth the crack growth analysis and the proof test flaw screening  logic, if utilized, shall be based on state-of-the-art fracture mechanics  methodology. Use of proof testing as an alternative to NDE to  support safe life determination shall require prior approval of the  RFCA.\u201d    \u201cAll Fracture Critical Parts shall be subjected to NDE or proof testing  to screen internal and external cracks. Prior approval is required from  the RFCA when a proof test is used as the crack-screening  technique. Hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance  (i.e., not screening for specific cracks) shall receive post-proof test  NDE at critical welds and other critical sections.\u201d  fracture mechanics methodology\u201d were levied on this procedure because proof testing can itself  be damaging and lead to early failures of components. For components made from ductile  metals or crack-tolerant composites, sufficiently large preexisting cracks may grow due to the  proof test loading, and yet not be detected nor fail the component during the proof test. When  this occurs, the component can have a lower reliability in service than if no proof test screening  were performed.   o avoid this detrimental loss of reliability due to proof testing, appropriate NDE may be used  before and after the proof test to increase the probability of removing cracked components from  service. Due to this duplication of effort, the proof-test process for ductile materials may not be  cost-effective, and it may be simpler to rely on NDE alone.  integrity, an approach that has been used to ensure the proof test improves component  reliability is to quantify the amount of crack extension that is likely to occur during the proof test,  and conservatively account for this growth in the safe life analysis. This requires defining the  initial flaw size based on the size that is likely to be missed by the initial NDE inspection or that  can be produced by the component manufacturing process.   determined by a suitably conservative experimental testing program, and/or by use of  advanced, non-linear fracture analysis analytical methods. Both approaches must build forward  from estimates of the largest pre-existing flaw size in the component before the proof test. The          experimental method requires use of a component, or a simulated-component specimen that  conservatively models the component material, expected pre-existing flaw, and fracture  constraint conditions around the flaw. The analytical method requires use of advanced, typically  non-linear fracture analysis tools that have been shown to conservatively predict the expected  amounts of crack growth for situations that will accurately model or bound the fracture behavior  of the component during the proof test. Note that some conditions / assumptions, such as  tensile residual stresses and elevated material toughness values, are non-conservative when  applied to proof testing-based demonstrations of structural reliability.  f neither experimental nor advanced analytical evaluations are performed to evaluate crack  growth during the proof test, such that the proof test analysis is based on elementary fracture  mechanics approaches such as are found in many crack analysis programs, then the RFCA  may disallow use of proof testing as a crack screening method for critical hardware due to the  risk of doing more harm than good to the overall component reliability.  hen it is judged that a proof test is appropriate to screen a metallic component or structure for  flaws, a proper environment for the test must be chosen. Ideally, the proof test should occur at  the temperature and in the medium in which the hardware will be used. If this is not feasible, an  environmental correction factor (ECF) must be used as indicated below.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  he proof factor for the test should not be adjusted below 1.05 unless approved by the RFCA.  Also, close attention should be paid so that basic strength requirements are not violated when  adjusting proof test factors upward. Where proof test are required as part of normal  qualification, the specified proof factor should be used if larger than the proof factor required by  fracture mechanics.    6.4 Detected Cracks in Fracture Critical Hardware. The first option to be considered  when a crack is detected in hardware should be to remove/repair the crack. If removal/repair of  the crack is not feasible, the following is an acceptable basis for analyzing detected cracks.  t is sometimes erroneously assumed that flight hardware may be used with a crack, provided  the crack does not exceed the \u201cminimum flaw size\u201d given in Table F-I, \u201cMinimum Initial Crack  Sizes for Fracture Analysis Based on NDE Method.\u201d Additional analysis work and conservatism  are required to show acceptability of a component with a known crack-like flaw, because now  the situation has changed dramatically from the expected conservatism implicit in the case of an  ASSUMED crack in a worst case position, to the situation of a KNOWN crack in a specific  location and geometry.             required  proof                     toughness   @    test @  operating             NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  A specific, detailed, fracture mechanics analysis (or test) shall be performed to justify  the use of any fracture critical flight part with detected crack-like flaws. Approval of the  RPA must be obtained prior to the use of any fracture-critical flight part containing  detected cracks or crack-like defects. Occurrences of detected crack-like flaws shall  be included in the fracture control summary report along with the basis for  acceptability.\u201d     A specific damage tolerance assessment shall be performed to justify the use of any  fracture critical part with detected cracks. The use of such a fracture critical part must  have prior approval of the RFCA. The analyses and rationale for acceptance of  detected cracks shall be included in the Fracture Control Summary Report. The  assessment shall be made using conservative assumptions regarding the actual  maximum crack size, material properties, and all internal and external loads.  Additional requirements including larger factors on crack size, service life, and/or  fracture than normally used for damage tolerance assessment may be imposed by the  RFCA.\u201d   size, stresses, and material properties and show acceptable life of the component. The  following conservative approaches are recommended:   bound the actual physical size of detected cracks, and any possible non-detected adjacent  cracks and/or crack tip extensions that will add to the effective length of the detected cracks.  The enveloping size to be used should be compatible with the particular NDE method utilized for  the crack detection.  recommended is to add to the detected crack size the size given in Table F-I (Appendix F) for  the particular crack type and NDE method. That is, for a crack detected on the surface  (Fig. 3.a), the analysis length would be taken as the detected length plus the NDE capability. If  no information is available on the depth other than it is not a through crack, the analysis depth  should be taken to be 95 percent of the thickness. If a detected embedded flaw (Fig. 3.b),  cannot be verified as truly embedded, i.e., does not break through to the surface, then it should  be considered as a through crack. If it can be verified only for one surface that it does not break  through, then it should be considered as a surface crack.   or example, if the detected crack is a part through surface crack in a 0.25 inch thick plate, and  penetrant NDE was used to detect a 0.1 inch total length crack, then the analysis must consider  the following bounding crack sizes:       must be determined for the worst-case limit loads expected during the mission (i.e., upper  bound load induced stresses). All additional stresses, such as residual stresses, must also be  appropriately combined in the analysis.  6.4.3 Material Property Conservatisms. The fracture toughness used for the analysis  must be a lower bound fracture toughness, based on available material data. If fewer than  seven values of material toughness data are available, then the lower bound must be taken as  the lower value of the following two cases: (a) the lowest value of all available applicable data,  or (b) the average of the available applicable data divided by the factor 1.20.  he crack growth rate material data used for the analysis of known cracks should be upper  bound. Upper bound data may be estimated by enveloping the growth rate data including the  lower and upper tail regions available in NASGRO\uf0d2. This envelope should be compared with  any other known data points to make certain that it does indeed envelope the data. Several  methods exist for establishing the upper bound growth curve, ranging from statistical +3\uf073  bounding to hand drawn curves. Figure 4 shows an example of a da/dn vs. \uf044K curve with mean  and upper bound curves. The analyst should contact the RFCA and associated materials group  for approval of upper bound properties before analyzing the cracked hardware. In the absence  of any other known data the analyst may use the NASGRO\uf0d2 data as is (average) and apply an  appropriate increase to the service life factor. Because this multiplying factor can range from 2  to beyond five (5) times, the analyst should seek guidance from the RFCA in selecting a final  service life factor. In general, material data will be required for an RFCA to approve use of  cracked hardware.   component has a service life factor of four (4) based on the conservatively bounded crack sizes,  applied stresses, fracture toughness, and upper bound crack growth rate. For especially critical  applications, the RFCA may require a larger service life factor. To protect against cracks near  instability, it is necessary to impose a safety factor to provide margin against limit load fracture.  Therefore, in addition to the service life factor, the analysis also must show a fracture safety  factor of 1.5 as indicated below:  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   Kc = the appropriate lower bound fracture toughness, and  K = the stress intensity at limit load for the crack size computed to exist at the  end of one service life.

Material drawing notes must be explicit and control the product form, condition and heat  treatment of the material. Processes with consequences for fracture control, such as welding,  etching, or plating, must be controlled and documented.   payload, a system must be in place to assure that delivered fracture critical hardware is as  designed and assessed. This program should include sufficient tracking to provide for fracture  control assessment of load changes, modifications or redesigns of fracture critical hardware,  and discrepancy reviews (DR\u2019s), or equivalent, for anomalies that could affect part/component  fracture characteristics and life.

The history should cover the entire life of the part as described in Section 6.1.3. For  multi-mission hardware, the used life of the hardware should be booked against the remaining  life so that assessment of flight readiness from a fracture control point of view can readily be  made between missions.   For example, if it is known with certainty that the hardware is not ahead of the original load  spectrum, then this may be documented with supporting rationale for between flight reviews.   responsible NDE organization. Inspection records should bear the stamp and/or signature of  the inspector. Proof test results should be documented in a report.

A typical fracture  control program would generally include the following documentation:    8.1 Fracture Control Plan. The fracture control plan describes how fracture control will  be met. In the past there has been a strong tendency to repeat the requirements, e.g., repeat  NASA-STD-5003 for the plan. This is not a plan and is useless for everyone and a waste of  time and money.   good fracture control plan lists all the specific activities that will be done to satisfy fracture  control, e.g., if the structure included a major glass component, the plan would address the  approach that will be used to show an acceptable fracture control process for the glass. If it is  known, the plan should indicate if the glass will be proof tested or designed to a factor of safety  of five and forego the proof test.

The type of NDE should be specified (eddy current, penetrant, etc.,) along  with a statement that, \u201cno detected cracks are allowed.\u201d Any detected cracks should be  reported for assessment per Section 6.4. As applicable, processing or fabrication requirements  that would affect fracture properties of a fracture critical part in a given application, including  heat treatments, welding requirements, grain or fiber direction, etc., should also be specifically  called out on the part drawing.  8.3 Fracture Control Summary Report (FCSR). To certify fracture control compliance of  a payload, the PD must prepare a fracture control summary report on the total system for review  and approval by the RFCA and the PSRP. It is required for the Phase 3 Safety Review. As a  minimum, the following information must be provided:   and heat treatment used and the basis for part acceptability (i.e., safe- life analysis, test,  acceptable durability, insignificant fatigue loading, etc.). Fracture critical parts that are limited  life must be specifically identified. A statement to the effect that all other parts were examined  and determined to be non-fracture critical must be included.       Reflown fail safe hardware should have verification that any required \u201cbetween mission\u201d  inspections have been done.       8. Copies of MUAs for fracture critical or low risk parts/components and a summary of  DR\u2019s, or equivalent reviews, of anomalies that could affect the performance of fracture critical  parts/components.       information as listed above, a statement to that effect with reference to supporting  documentation must be submitted as the FCSR.       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Supporting detailed documentation such as drawings, calculations, analyses, data printouts,  inspection plans or records, specifications, certifications, reports, procedures, etc., should not  be submitted as a part of the FCSR, but must be made available for review by the RFCA if  requested.     8.4 Presentation Summarizing The Fracture Control Program. A presentation will have  to be made at various reviews summarizing the fracture control program for review committees  and RFCAs. These detailed presentations should include the following:  1.

Put extended analysis and computer runs such as  NASGRO\uf0d2 in an appendix. List the stresses and material properties used in the fracture control  analysis. Provide sources for each. If the stress analysis is also being done in the same report,  follow the individual part stress analysis immediately with the fracture analysis. Include part free  body diagrams, stress contours as applicable, crack location and orientation, and crack model  (e.g., TC01 from NASGRO\uf0d2). List assumptions.     9. Conclusions. Ideally the analyst will be able to conclude that the analysis is  complete and there are no open issues. Otherwise summarize the status and provide closure  plans for any remaining work.     used by the inspector to record results. The sheets should identify the part name, part number,  serial number, material and condition, type NDE and sensitivity level, a sketch of the part  showing the area inspected and type of crack inspected for, the results of the inspection and the  inspector\u2019s signature, date, and stamp. Instead of a separate report, this data may be included  in an appendix of the detailed fracture control analysis report (Section 8.5) if available at the  time that report is published.   safe life compliance, it should be documented in a report. Data sheets from the vender will  suffice for routine proof test of lines, fittings, and pressure vessels. For other tests, the  hardware configuration, loading and test setup should be documented with sketches and  photographs. Actual test loading scenarios and environments should be recorded and reported.  Conclusions as to the acceptability of the hardware based on the test performed should be  included in the report per the criteria established in the detailed fracture control analysis report.  Instead of a separate test report, this data may be included in an appendix of the detailed  fracture control analysis report (Section 8.5) if available at the time that the report is published.  11. Appendices. Include detailed analysis, NASGRO\uf0d2 computer runs, test results,  inspection sheets and other supporting data that would interrupt the flow of the body text.           of fracture critical items for the life of the project. This is especially important if limited life  hardware is involved. The report should track projected use against remaining life for each  fracture critical part at appropriate intervals to demonstrate that the hardware is being operated  within fracture control requirements.    n the event of specialized hardware or applications where the assessments or techniques  delineated in the guidelines in this handbook may not be feasible or effective, or where potential  cost savings are significant while maintaining an acceptable level of fracture control, alternatives  may be proposed. Alternatives must be approved by the responsible fracture control and safety  authorities.   unique NDE approaches, special kinds of flaw screening, flaw retardation, etc., may be  proposed when alternative methods are viable candidates for effective and efficient fracture  control. Alternatives proposed for payloads or ISS hardware must be approved by the RFCA  and the PSRP or the SRP, as applicable, and must be identified on appropriate hazard reports  for formal approval. Approval should be requested by the program/project immediately upon  identification of the need for an alternative procedure.   Appendix A \u2013 Definitions) will be a common occurrence. Some experiments, including  processing or medical investigations and other in-flight tests, often utilize specialized hardware  and applications involving direct contact and manipulation by personnel. Fracture control,  where applicable, can be complex and may require alternatives to, or modifications of  conventional fracture control approaches. Experiments utilizing furnaces, autoclaves,  potentially toxic materials in ampoules and/or cartridges, unique pressurized systems, cryo-  systems, etc., can be special categories of hardware that may need to be assessed for fracture  control on a unique basis. Where feasible, guidelines in this handbook should be implemented  as appropriate. The RFCA, including cognizant Fracture Control Boards and safety  organizations, should be consulted when uncertainty about fracture control exists.   assure safe life rather than the performance of safe life analyses on individual fracture critical  parts may be implemented where feasible and efficient. Such a program utilizes similarity or a  design factor of safety that will assure working stress levels in all fracture critical parts (where  single part failure would be catastrophic) that will not grow flaws that are theoretically  undetected, by standard NDE, to a critical size in four service lives. The required NDE, etc.,  must be identified on drawings and applied to all fracture critical parts. This approach must be  supported by sufficient documented assessment including appropriate stress analyses,  evaluation of the effects of load spectrum and part size on flaw growth potential, and  inspectability of hardware to assure validity of the implementation. Assured safe life can be  sensitive to significant load or frequency increases and must be reverified if such occur.  Assured safe life approaches, when used, must be summarized in the fracture reports.

An adjustment factor used to account for differences  between the environment (thermal and chemical) in which a part is used and the environment in  which it is proof tested.    ail Safe. For fracture control, a condition where, after failure of a single individual structural  member, the remaining structure (considered unflawed) can withstand the redistributed loads  with a minimum ultimate safety factor of 1.0 on limit load, and the failure will not release a  potentially catastrophic free body. This is not the same as a part whose individual failure in the  absence of redundancy is not a catastrophic hazard although these parts may also be described  as \u201cfail safe\u201d and non-fracture critical.   light Hardware. Any structure, payload, experiment, system, component/part, etc., that will  accompany the NSTS or the Space Station during ferry flight, launch, orbit, or landing, or any  hardware that is built to flight structural requirements.     racture Control Coordinator (FCC). A designated individual with experience in structures  and fracture control who is responsible for the implementation of payload fracture control and  ensuring its effectiveness in meeting all requirements by monitoring, reviewing, and approving  all related activities performed both internally and by subcontractors that affect the fracture  control aspects of the payload.  that is responsible for fracture control methodology and which has the authority to interpret  fracture control requirements within the Responsible Payload Organization.   the presence of a crack is a catastrophic hazard, and which requires safe life analysis or other  fracture control assessment to be shown acceptable for flight.  hazard. Hazardous fluids include liquid chemical propellants and highly toxic liquids or gases.  A fluid is also hazardous if its release would create a hazardous environment such as a danger  of fire or explosion, unacceptable dilution of breathing oxygen, an increase of oxygen above  flammability limits, over-pressurization of a compartment, loss of a safety critical system, etc.          Hazardous Fluid Container. Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system)  container, or housing that contains a fluid whose release would cause a catastrophic hazard,  and has stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) with an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa). See Appendix G for flow chart showing pressurized  hardware definitions.  nitial Crack Size. The crack size that is assumed to exist at the beginning of component/part  safe life analysis, as determined by NDE or proof testing.  EAC. Stress intensity factor threshold for environment assisted cracking. Highest value of  stress intensity factor at which crack growth is not observed for a specified combination of  material and environment.     eak Before Burst (LBB). Fracture mechanics concept that requires that the critical flaw size  be a through flaw at the MDP and therefore results in a leak rather than catastrophic burst. For  fracture control purposes, other component specific requirements are imposed for a component  to be classified as NHLBB. A vessel that can sustain a leak before rupture is inherently safer  than one that cannot; therefore a LBB vessel design is generally preferred.      NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005      KIc/Fty < 0.33 in1/2 (1.66 mm1/2). For steel bolts with unknown KIc, low fracture toughness is  assumed when Ftu > 180 ksi (1240 MPa).    aterials Usage Agreement (MUA). A formal document, approved by the responsible  materials organization, showing that a non-compliant material is acceptable for the specific  application identified.    NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Maximum Design Pressure (MDP). The highest pressure defined by maximum relief  pressure, maximum regulator pressure, or maximum temperature. Transient pressures must be  considered. Where pressure regulators, relief devices, and/or a thermal control system (e.g.,  heaters) are used to control pressure, collectively they must be two-fault tolerant from causing  the pressure to exceed the MDP of the system. When determining MDP the maximum  temperature to be experienced during an Orbiter abort to a site without cooling facilities must  also be considered. When designing, analyzing, or testing pressurized hardware, loads other  than pressure that are present should be considered and added to the MDP loads as  appropriate. MDP in this handbook is to be interpreted as including the effects of these  combined loads when the non-pressure loads are significant.     established and standardized inspection techniques that are harmless to hardware, such as  radiography, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic particle, and eddy current.    on-Hazardous Leak Before Burst (NHLBB). Fracture control concept that requires that the  critical flaw size be a through flaw at MDP and that leak will not cause a catastrophic hazard. In  general, an isolated NHLBB vessel is assumed to leak down to zero pressure without any  further cycling, which assures that the crack cannot subsequently grow to critical size (rupture).  Vessels that can have the pressure cycled or have significant externally applied loads after  developing a leak are not NHLBB. In all NASA payload/experiment fracture control applications,  for a vessel to be classified NHLBB, it is required that the critical flaw at MDP be a through flaw  with a length of at least 10 times the thickness. See Section 5.1.4, Appendix H, and other  Sections of this document for component specific requirements.    otentially Fracture Critical Part.

Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system) container,  component, or housing that is sealed to maintain an internal non-hazardous environment and  that has a stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) and an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa). Sealed containers generally contain approximately  15 psia internal pressure or less. See Appendix G for flow chart showing pressurized hardware  definitions.   through its planned and specified usage. All loadings and environments encountered during  this period that will affect crack growth (post crack screening) must be addressed in safe life  analysis and testing. All manufacturing, testing, transportation, launch, on-orbit, descent,  landing, and post landing events must be considered. A service life is sometimes referred to as  a lifetime. In this sense, lifetime means a specified life as opposed to an analytically predicted  life.   service life factor of four (4) is required. The service life factor is often referred to as the life  factor.    a structural joint where the load path is transmitted through a single fastener or pin or other  single structural element.   pecial NDE.

These  methods used the \u201cPunch\u201d equation from Reference 21. Various formulae have been  developed by investigators to assess containment. Of these, the Punch equation has been  favored for use in containment assessments of enclosed loose parts on payloads and is  supported by a limited amount of test data. The Punch equation is based on data generated to  establish the energy required to \u201cpunch out\u201d various sizes of circular areas in metals with given  thickness and tensile yield strength. Use of penetration equations involves some degree of  subjectivity, but the Punch equation is accepted as conservative. In addition to the container  penetration analysis, it is sometimes necessary to address the fasteners that hold the container  together. The Punch equation application to rotating parts is addressed in Section B.2, to  general parts in Section B.3, and whether or not a fastener analysis is required and some things  to consider in such an analysis are addressed in Section B.4.   of rotating devices often necessitate an evaluation of containment capability of covers, rings,  housings, etc., which surround a rotating part such as a fan, motor, gyroscope, etc. For  extremely high rotational velocities, other additional considerations such as rubbing will likely  need to be considered to help dissipate the energy. The Punch equation may be written as  follows:   V = r\uf077 where: r = outer radius of the rotating part  \uf077 = rotational speed of the rotating part   perimeter length of the predicted impact area and shape to a circle with an equal perimeter  having a diameter D\uf0a2. D\uf0a2 may be substituted for D in the equation. The predicted area and  shape is based on the entire frontal face of the part assumed normal to the container on impact.     Fty = Tensile yield strength of the container  D = Diameter of the projectile  M = Mass of projectile  T = Thickness required to contain the projectile  V = Impact velocity       MV  \uf070  2                                 NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  If the calculated \u201cT\u201d is larger than the actual enclosure thickness then the rotating part will not be  contained in the event of fragment generation of the shape, size and mass assessed. A rotating  part, which would not be contained, must be assessed for safe life using a conventional fracture  mechanics approach.  B.2.1 Sample Calculation. A small 2 (two) blade cooling fan has a diameter of 3.06  inches. The fan weighs 0.302 lbs (137 gms) and rotates at 10,000 rpm (1047 rad/sec). The fan  and its housing are made of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. The blades are 0.07 inch thick and the  housing is 0.1 inch thick. Calculations show that the rotating fan does not possess the energy  level necessary (14,240 ft-lbs) to automatically require proof testing, inspection and safe life  assessment. Because of high rpm, an analysis must be made for containment.

Examples follow:   structural failure of contained structures or parts is determined by the mass of the detached part  (M) and the velocity (V) it can attain within the confines of its container. Contributors to the  projectile impact velocity that the analyst should consider are:  mounting prior to release, nor the relative velocity due to the vibration response of the impacted  wall is generally considered in the velocity calculations.

If the analyst is unsure about the need for their inclusion, the RFCA should be  consulted.  B.4 Container Fastener Analysis. As stated earlier, it is sometimes necessary to address  the fasteners that hold the container together. For example, the fasteners that hold the lid on a  box may require analysis to show that they would not break in the event that the lid is impacted  by a loose part. Both rotating and stationary parts should be assessed for the need of this  check.   large contact area whose impact would not be expected to penetrate the walls, but would  nonetheless be a significant dissipation of energy. This check is not required for electronics and  similar boxes using standard packaging designs. So, it is anticipated that the analyst will only  rarely be confronted with situations where this analysis is warranted. The analyst should  coordinate with the RFCA when uncertainty exists for analyzing container fasteners.    a. Does the loose part strike at a single fastener or between fasteners?  b. Does the fastener fail in tension or extrude the fastener head through the wall   c. If a fastener fails, will adjacent fasteners carry the remaining energy?  d. If a fastener(s) fails, will the deflection of the cover remain small enough so that the     simplified method for assessing the tensile capability assuming a loose part impacts directly  upon a single fastener is given below. This is conservative since a loose part is most likely to  strike in an area where the load would be shared among more than one fastener. If the fastener  passes this check, a similar check would be required for extruding the fastener head through the  cover wall. If both these checks are passed, the analysis would generally be considered  complete; otherwise, the analyst must investigate further the type of things listed above.  he approach is to assume that the kinetic energy of the loose part must be absorbed by the  strain energy capability of the fastener. This kinetic energy is readily available from the analysis  completed in Section B.2 or Section B.3 from which the mass and impact velocity are known.  K.E. = Kinetic energy of the loose part (in-lb)  m = Mass of the loose part (lb sec2/in)  V = Impact velocity of the loose part from equation B2 or B4 (in/sec)        .                        NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  An acceptable estimate of the allowable strain energy of a bolt in tension can be calculated  from:   determined from the work already done in Section B.2 or Section B.3. This kinetic energy would  be calculated using equation B8 and compared to the strain energy capability determined from  equation B9 for the weakest fastener holding the container together.            .   \uf03d \uf065  ult   P  ty  P  tu              NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   ASSISTANCE IN DETERMINING NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK BEFORE BURST (NHLBB)  FOR PRESSURE SYSTEM COMPONENTS   System Components. The design safety factor requirements applied to typical pressurized  systems and common materials of construction tend to ensure that the critical flaw size (CFS)  requirements for NHLBB are met under operating conditions. NHLBB is characterized by a  relatively slow leak as opposed to rapid tearing or fragmentary rupture. The NASA fracture  control practices for payloads/experiments require the CFS to be a through flaw of length at  least 10 times the thickness for the component to be NHLBB. Note that this CFS requirement is  a necessary condition for NHLBB, but not a sufficient one. The check sheets in Appendix H  provide all the requirements for a component to be NHLBB.  components can be checked by reference to Figure C-1. Any point above the curve for the OD  (outer diameter) of interest indicates the CFS requirement for NHLBB is met. An assumed flaw  with a length 10 times the membrane thickness (2c = 10t) has been incorporated into the curves  as the basis for this determination. The curves are plotted as the ratio of fracture toughness to  internal pressure versus the ratio of membrane thickness to outer diameter. Note that  consistent units should be used for pressure and toughness. If Figure C-1 indicates CFS  requirements for NHLBB are not met, a more specific fracture mechanics analysis may be  conducted addressing actual component parameters and properties. When the 10t check is  made, the analyst should make sure that any actual through cracks in the hardware will be less  than 10t in length. Otherwise, an actual crack in the hardware may have grown past 10t  potentially leading to an unsafe situation.

The analyst only needs to know the total limit stress  value (low frequency + random + acoustic). The equivalent number of cycles at a percentage of  this limit load is specified by the spectrum. Equivalency is based on \u201cequivalent crack growth\u201d  as would occur in the actual environment. The number of cycles at each stress level for the  combined launch/ascent and landing/ descent conditions is tabulated in the column labeled  \u201cTotal\u201d of Table D-I. The development of this spectrum is reported in Reference 20. The  spectrum as presented here is taken from Reference 19.

An acceptable part classification process is depicted in Figure  E-1. This Figure is to be used in conjunction with Tables E-I and E-II. Table E-II provides a guide  to part classification along with references to appropriate Sections of the handbook for specific  parts. The results from this process are a classification of each non-exempt part and analyses  supporting non-fracture critical classifications. The classifications are used as a basis for the  fracture control summary list (Section E.4) and the analyses are included in the fracture control  analysis report (Section 8.5).   since it contains all the parts. If not available, the analyst can create a list from the available  drawings and layouts. From this list the analyst removes the exempt parts (or doesn\u2019t put them  on it if creating the list). The remaining non-exempt parts are to be classified and appear on the  fracture control summary list (Section E.4).    nitial screening of the hardware is used to classify all the parts that have a clear and obvious  disposition. Items that are always fracture critical, such as pressure vessels, are identified here.  Items for which structural failure would obviously create (or obviously not create) a catastrophic  hazard are identified as fracture critical (or non-fracture critical). If this discrimination is unclear,  the item moves on to detailed screening. The items identified as non-fracture critical must be  given one of the non-fracture critical classifications (contained, fail safe, etc.) from Table E-II.  The analyst should provide rationale for these \u201cjudgment calls\u201d similar to that done for contained  (CR1) and fail safe (FS1) in Section E.4, Example 1. Sound reasoning must be exercised in  making these classifications since they are subject to challenge at reviews. If the analyst is  unsure about a classification at this point, or a credible challenge can be made, the part is set  aside for detailed screening.                           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  During initial screening, the analyst is encouraged to consult the project Failure Mode and  Effects Analysis and Critical Items List (FMEA/CIL). This document can provide valuable insight  when judging the outcome of potential failures. The reliability organization for a particular  project generates the FMEA/CIL. A Hazards Analysis can also be useful in the part screening  process.   be documented or reported as such; it is an intermediate step to assist the analyst in tracking  parts that require documented analysis or rationale to support their non-fracture critical  classification or will require a safe life analysis or other assessment as a fracture critical part. In  detailed screening of a part, the analyst would select the most likely non-fracture critical  classification from Table E-II and generate an analysis or documented assessment to support  that classification. This document would be included as part of the fracture control analysis  report and may be in the form of a check sheet (Appendix H), or other appropriate formats of the  analyst\u2019s choosing. If no non-fracture critical classification can be established, the part is  fracture critical.  require a separate analysis to put them there. They are obvious from the initial screening or get  there by default in the detailed screening. Once declared fracture critical, a part is classified per  Table E-II and then requires a documented fracture mechanics analysis or documented  rationale to be included in the fracture control report to show safe life or NHLBB.   f the analyst follows the process described above, the number of fracture critical parts will only  include those that are truly facture critical and will generally result in an efficient fracture control  program. In some instances, it may be more efficient to classify a part fracture critical and put it  under fracture control rather than do the analysis required to show it non-fracture critical. For  example, if a complex structure has fail safe members, and a coupled loads analysis with  individual members removed is required to show fail safe, it is probably more efficient to classify  the parts fracture critical and put them under fracture control.

This appendix provides guidance on deciding what to call the  various types of pressurized hardware (G.2) and a method for calculating the stored energy in a  pressurized container (G.3). The stored energy is required in deciding if the container is a  pressure vessel.    G.2 Pressurized Hardware Definitions. Deciding what label to attach to the various  pressurized hardware that may be under consideration can be very confusing and lead to  misinterpretation of the requirements. Therefore, the following flow chart (Figure G-1) is  provided to assist the analyst in this decision. The definitions (Appendix A) are repeated below  for various pressurized items to make it convenient to the reader for correlation with the flow  chart. Habitable modules are not included here since their discrimination should be readily  apparent.  azardous Fluid Container. Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system)  container, or housing that contains a fluid whose release would cause a catastrophic hazard,  and has stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) with an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa).        ressurized Component. A line, fitting, valve, regulator, etc., that is part of a pressurized  system and intended primarily to sustain a fluid pressure.

Requirements  for these classifications are listed numerically in individual tables called check sheets. The  analyst is presented with simple direct statements (the requirements) that he or she responds to  by checking an associated box if true or leaving blank if not true. The sheet indicates which  boxes must be checked to meet low risk or NHLBB requirements. The analyst would fill out one  of these sheets for each part being evaluated. The sheet provides a place for identification of  part description, drawing number, material, and heat treat.  he individual sheets would be included in the fracture control analysis report, perhaps in an  appendix.

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide background and rationale for  deciding when to carry out such post proof NDE. Pre-proof NDE of these items should be done  to prevent major damage during proof. The basis for the discussion is NASA-STD-5007, which  requires that hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance receive post-proof test NDE  at critical welds and other critical sections. These discussions do not apply to items that are proof  tested to screen for specific flaws, i.e., utilizing proof test as the flaw screening method.   welds require a clear understanding of project and safety requirements. Post-proof NDE of  welds in pressure vessels or habitable modules can be governed by program requirements for  manned safety or mission assurance involving national assets, which by their status alone may  warrant post-proof NDE. Fracture control is required by NASA to support the safety of all  manned space flight systems, but is not required for general payloads for purposes of mission  assurance. Safety and whether or not post-proof NDE of welds is required depend largely on  the mode of failure as discussed below.   pressure vessel or a module with a LBB design can eventually develop a slow leak if a large  enough flaw is present and enough loading cycles are applied during service. If the fluid is not  hazardous, slow loss of the fluid is not hazardous, the leak unloads the vessel so further crack  growth is not possible, and the critical flaw at MDP is a through flaw of length at least 10 times  the thickness, then such a failure is benign and the vessel can be classified as NHLBB. The  LBB designation is based on an engineering assessment of the vessel design; an NHLBB  fracture control classification is based on the consequences of the leak. An NHLBB classified  vessel does not require post proof NDE based on safety (Reference 29), but it is strongly  recommended that post proof NDE be performed.  f the design is not LBB (fragmentary or abrupt rupture is possible), or a leak of the fluid is a  hazard, or load is maintained on the vessel, then failure would be hazardous and \u201csafe life\u201d  assurance through fracture control methodology is required. These vessels are designated  \u201csafe life\u201d designs and require that welds be inspected post proof.  because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than  one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for components that will have safe  life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.    habitable module, for which the CFS is a through flaw of length at least 10t, is not classified  as NHLBB, because pressure must be maintained. The continued pressure cycling due to the  \u201cmake up\u201d air can grow the crack, so the module will require safe life classification and post  proof inspection.                 that are difficult to predict or account for. This is particularly true for unique \u201cone of a kind\u201d  structures. The proof test enhances the NDE capability to discover problems due to:  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     fracture critical structure as well as fracture critical portions of the non-welded pressure shell  wall, i.e., the pressure shell base material. Technically, these areas are governed by the same  NHLBB and post-proof NDE requirements as the pressure shell welds. An exception is made  for pressure vessels of standard design with smooth membrane and transition areas and that  are in the previous experience base. These standard design pressure vessels require only that  the welds receive post-proof NDE. The NDE approach for other pressure vessels should be  coordinated with the RFCA. It is recognized that strict implementation of these requirements is  not always programmatically feasible; however, deviations must be approved by the RFCA.  n summary, good engineering practice dictates that all welds in habitable modules and  pressure vessels receive post-proof NDE.   \uf0b7  \uf0b7 Weld repairs, overlaps, intersections, and porosity  \uf0b7 Weld geometry, including peaking and mismatch  \uf0b7  \uf0b7 Workmanship  \uf0b7                  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005    J.1 Dimensions for Fracture Control Analyses. Generally, nominal part dimensions will  suffice for fracture control analyses of payloads. An exception is for detected cracks. Worst-  case dimensions including worst-case positional tolerances are required for analysis of detected  cracks (see Section 6.4.1 for the dimensions to use for the detected crack). In cases of extreme  criticality, it is prudent to exercise caution; therefore in these cases the analyst should  coordinate the dimension used with the RFCA. Actual dimensions that conservatively allow for  the measurement accuracy may always be used. Table J-I below specifies the analysis type  and dimension for fracture control analysis.

This appendix (Reference 1, Section K.7) provides examples and  guidance for interpretation of fracture criticality classification and fracture control implementation  of rotating machinery with kinetic energy less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules).  he Centrifuge Rotor (CR) example described in this appendix has less kinetic energy than  stated above but has significant rotational momentum and fracture critical parts. The parts are  classified fracture critical because they have credible structural failure modes due to crack  propagation that may cause sudden jamming and stoppage of the rotor generating loads that  could result in a catastrophic hazard.   rotating body is computed as  speed in radians per second. Section 5.2.2 on fracture critical rotating machinery states in part:        components for fracture criticality is shown in the Figure K-1 flowchart. If the rotating machinery  kinetic energy exceeds the criteria specified in Section 5.2.2, it is fracture critical unless also  shown to be contained per Section 5.1.2. For rotating machinery with less than this amount of  kinetic energy, a fracture critical component classification requires findings that the:   (136 N-m-s) and presents a catastrophic hazard due to loads generated from a sudden jamming  or stoppage of the rotor that exceeds structural allowable loads, and  he rotor sudden jamming or stoppage loads referenced in item (1) may be estimated as  described in later sections in this appendix. If the sudden stop loads exceed allowables and  generate a catastrophic hazard on the mechanical assembly support structures, carrier, or  vehicle, the mechanical assembly is considered potentially fracture critical. Alternatively, a  conservative assumption may be made that the rotating machinery is potentially fracture critical  if the rotating machinery angular momentum exceeds the 100 pound-foot-seconds (136 N-m-s)  limit without calculation of the rotor sudden stop induced dynamic loads. If the mechanical  assembly is a potentially fracture critical assembly, all assembly parts \u2013 both rotating and non-  rotating, must be assessed for fracture criticality per item (2) above.    A rotating mechanical assembly is fracture critical if it has a kinetic energy of  ). Rotating  14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) or greater (based on  machinery with lower kinetic energy levels than stated above may have  fracture critical components if structural failure of them due to crack propagation                              t is noted in passing that a sudden stop or jamming event could also initiate from introduction of  external jamming debris between the rotor and adjacent stationary components, or seizure of  rotating mechanisms such as bearings. These hazards, which do not result from propagation of  preexisting cracks that can be redressed through fracture control, are not the focus of this  Appendix. These types of hazards may be addressed by safety procedures such as design for  minimum risk defined in Reference 2, (Section K.7) and discussed briefly in Section K.6.

These loads are to be utilized for fracture mechanics assessments such as crack  growth safe-life calculations, structural fail-safe evaluations for fracture control, and fatigue life  assessments where needed for low risk classification of parts.  f potentially fracture critical rotating machinery parts are found to present a credible  catastrophic rotor jamming hazard from structural failure due to crack propagation, except as  noted below, they are fracture critical parts and typical requirements for fracture critical  structural components per Section 6, etc. are applicable. Note, however, that if the kinetic  energy classification limit cited in Section 5.2.2 is not exceeded, the associated spin-type proof  test, etc. as specified in Section 5.2.2 may still be used but are not requirements.  otentially fracture critical rotating machinery parts are not fracture critical due to the rotating  condition if they meet any of three criteria shown in the flow chart, such as low risk criteria per  Section 5.1.12. They also are not fracture critical if shown to meet fail-safe criteria per Section  5.1.3, with the additional requirement that a credible jamming of the rotating machinery must not  occur due to a failure of any structure or sub components in the fail-safe scenario; an example  is that individual failed fasteners in a group of fasteners that attach a rotor machinery  component by a fail-safe approach must not present a credible risk of jamming the rotor  machinery. Additionally, parts may be non-fracture critical if shown to be contained per Section  5.1.2 in a manner such that they cannot participate in a rotor sudden stoppage event that  generates catastrophic loadings.   arts which are shown to be non-fracture critical still must be fracture controlled for structural  integrity assurance as noted in Section 5.2 and should comply with the intent of fracture control  requirements without imposing further activity beyond conventional aerospace verification and  quality assurance procedures.  from crack propagation are subjected to the usual screening criteria and requirements as  detailed in Section 5 for all the applicable environments throughout the service life.  K.2.3 Angular Momentum and Induced Sudden Stop Loads. As discussed in previous  Sections, in order to complete the determination of hazard criticality due to rotor sudden stop  induced loads on the mechanical rotor assembly support structures, carrier, or vehicle, the  impulsive sudden stop induced loads are needed. (This presumes the analysis needs to go  beyond the simple assessment of whether or not the 100 foot-pound-sec (136 N-m-s) angular  momentum limit criteria are exceeded.)  s shown later in Section K.4 by analysis of simple models, the impulsive loads generated in a  sudden stop are directly proportional to the angular momentum, H, and inversely proportional to  the speed of the sudden stop, t. The angular momentum of a rotating body is computed as          . The maximum angular momentum a rotating body can have and remain non-fracture  critical by the kinetic energy criteria can be determined as shown in the hyperbolic equation (K1)  and plotted in Figure K-2.    ote that low speed rotating machinery may have very large angular momentum and not  exceed these fracture criticality criteria. As shown in Section K.4.2, the torque, T, induced  during a sudden stop into a tangential jamming spring for a rotor supported on a base is  inversely proportional to the time, t, to reach the maximum torque. The equation is:   loads is the time t. As shown in the derivation in Section K.4.2, if the circumferential spring can  be determined for the simplified model analyzed, then the time t is defined. The time is  assumed to be one second for most of the cited examples for ease of calculation and  comparisons, but this value is not a generally applicable number. Loads should be computed  for relevant stop times for the application. It is possible to compute a sudden stop time for some  simple rotor jamming models as shown in Section K.4, but for more complex situations such as  the Centrifuge Rotor example, more involved analyses or tests may be required.   nce the rotor sudden stop loads are determined, they can be compared to allowables for the  rotating machinery support structures, carrier, or vehicle. Note in addition to the dynamic torque  discussed above, dynamic forces may also be generated which have to be assessed.

Three flat steel disk examples spinning at 8,000 RPM and  one at 3,000 RPM are detailed in Table K-I. There are two small 8 inch diameter disks identified  as A and B with thickness of 0.5 inch and 2.0 inch respectively, which have only 8% and 32%,  respectively, of the critical kinetic energy limit value definition for fracture criticality. They  represent possible shrouded or enclosed fans which are non-fracture critical as noted in  Section 5.1.5.  he two large 12 inch diameter disks C and D were selected to describe hardware that just  exceeds the kinetic energy criteria resulting in their classification as fracture critical. Disk C  operating at 8,000 RPM is only 1.25 inch thick, while the slower 3,000 RPM disk D has a  thickness of 9.7 inch. Disks C and D are both fracture critical per Section 5.2.2 and must meet  the spin test and NDE requirements as well as show adequate safe life if they are not contained  per Section 5.1.2. Disk D is also of interest since it provides a physical understanding of the  meaning of the 100 pound-foot-second angular momentum limit criteria cited in Section K.2.1  and shown in Figure K-1.   Centrifuge Rotor (CR), shown in Figure K-3, with details in Table K-I and described more  completely in Section K.5, spins at only 41 RPM, and possesses only 45% of the kinetic energy  limit criteria for fracture criticality. However, it has fracture critical parts because it has a very  large angular momentum and there are credible sudden stop events due to structural or  component failures from crack propagation leading to jamming of the rotor, resulting in  catastrophic loads on the Centrifuge Accommodation Module (CAM) and to the ISS vehicle.  The CR rotor structure is fracture critical as well as attachments holding components which  could jam the rotor.                  here are other events than structural failure which could lead to sudden stop hazard of the CR,  such as introduction of debris that jams the rotor and seizure of bearings as shown in Figure K-10.  These hazards are controlled by special designs to meet safety requirements.    K.3.3 Example Data Plot and Tables. Torques from a rotating body operating at the  kinetic energy limit momentum given by equation (K1) and coming to a sudden stop in one  second are plotted in Figure K-4. The dashed curve is for a constant deceleration torque using  equation (K3). The solid curve is a sudden stop into a circumferential spring from equations (K2)  or (K9). The rotating disk and Centrifuge Rotor examples are also plotted using the model for a  sudden stop into a circumferential spring. The choice of stop time t of one second was for  numerical convenience and is not a generally applicable value. The maximum torque is  inversely proportional to the actual time; the actual time to reach the maximum loading should  be used in calculations.

That sudden stop torque exceeds the allowable torque of 20,500 foot-  pounds at the ISS CAM to Node 2 interface by a large factor, and results in a classification of  the CR structure and other components as fracture critical even though the CR has only 45% of  the kinetic energy limit criteria for fracture critical rotating equipment.  t should be noted, however, the actual loads used to analyze the Centrifuge Rotor hardware  had to be developed from a more complex assessment. The Centrifuge Rotor is supported on  three-dimensional vibration isolation in the ISS on-orbit configuration, which permits all possible  three-dimensional loads to interact with all the rotating body gyroscopic responses. This  situation generates very complex sets of coupled differential equations. To determine the  jamming forces for a spring deceleration a full three-dimensional ADAMS model was required.  These results showed a peak force occurred in only 0.023 seconds and had a magnitude of  47,000 lbs inducing a torque of 243,000 foot-pounds. If the sudden stop time of 0.023 seconds  is used in the simplified one-dimensional model equation (K9) a torque is predicted of only  205,000 foot-pounds and a force of 52,100 lbs. It is clear the simplified models may not be  accurate for complex 3D situations which differ from the simplified ones modeled, and some  caution is required when applying these equations to complex situations.              NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  K.4 Simplified models of Sudden stop induced Loadings. Two types of base supported  rotor sudden stop event configurations shown in Figure K-5 are analyzed below with simplified  models to determine loads and associated parameters. Although more complex analyses may  be required for applications such as the Centrifuge Rotor described in Section K.3.2, K.3.3, and  K.5, these simplified models are useful where applicable and also help to identify the  fundamental relationships of the related parameters.         a constant deceleration is assumed to act upon the rotor, which is assumed to be rotating at  initial speed   about a supported central axis as shown in Figure K-5(a). This situation may  occur if a constant deceleration force is applied to the outer radius of a rotating body. A ball or  roller bearing seizure may produce this situation if the rolling element binds with the bearing  races, resulting in the bearing rotating on one of the bearing race interfaces. However, bearing  failures of this type have been known to continue to rotate for appreciable time until heating  leads to a complete failure. Therefore, a bearing seizure may not present a catastrophic risk  provided the items identified in the reference on Design for Minimum Risk (Reference 2, Section  K.7) as described in Section K.6 are followed.      f the time involved in a rapid stop is known the torque can be computed from the body angular  momentum and equation (K3). If the sudden stop or deceleration is developed by loading at the  body outer radius R, the associated force F is equal to T/R. The tangential force induces a force  acting on the body center of gravity, with a resulting acceleration in g's equal to the force divided by  the body weight. For the case where a rotating body is presumed to possess a momentum at the  fracture critical kinetic energy limit per equation (K1), and a sudden stop time of one second, the  torque T can be plotted as a function of initial rotational speed in RPM as shown in Figure K-4 by  the dotted line. The number of revolutions required for the body to stop can be determined from:     \uf03d   IT   \uf028         \uf077  d  dt   \uf03d   t  2          t  \uf071  d  dt                    NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   occur if debris or a structural failure causes a rotor jamming event at the rotor outer radius. This  could be from loads transferred into a non-rotating shroud or other grounded body, which can be  simulated as loading a tangential spring at the rotor outer radius as shown in Figure K-5(b).  deceleration, can be computed from the equation for angular motion. It is assumed the body  remains supported at the center of rotation and does not translate. (If the body is free to  translate, such as the Centrifuge Rotor example, additional coupled equations of motion are  involved and this simple model does not apply.) Parameters include the grounded  circumferential spring stiffness k, and the circumferential spring force F due to the body rotation  angle          characteristics, the angular momentum, and the spring constant k. The spring may be computed  from the combined stiffness of rotor structures reacting the circumferential force plus stiffness of  any jamming debris and stiffness of the surrounding structure to ground. Alternatively, if the  sudden stop time to the peak load t is known, the associated parameter b and spring stiffness k  can be computed. The rotation at the time of maximum torque is    momentum and inversely proportional to the sudden stop time t to reach maximum torque. The  peak torque for this model of sudden stop acting into a spring is a factor of  value for the constant torque deceleration example.                  \uf071  2    d  \uf077  dt      \uf03d                   \uf071  2          \uf071  2     \uf028  0\uf077\uf03d                 \uf028  \uf077\uf02d\uf03d\uf0f7  I   )t(d  \uf071  2    \uf03d                     \uf029b/0\uf077  \uf028                  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   habitat types and provides a selectable, simulated gravity environment for biological specimens  on the Space Station.

NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005                         t is the general policy of the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) to produce space  systems with a high degree of safety. This is accomplished through good engineering  practices in the design, analyses, inspection, testing, fabrication and operation of these  systems.  ARC also implements a fracture control program for all space flight hardware used on manned  missions which is designed to meet NASA requirements specified in applicable documents  listed within this plan.  The purpose of fracture control as implemented in this Plan is to define and establish  the procedures to prevent payload hardware structural failure due to the propagation of  flaws, cracks, or crack-like defects in structures of this payload. The prevention of such  failures is specifically mandated by NASA safety requirements to preclude subsequent  catastrophic hazards to the National Safety Transportation System (NSTS),  International Space Station (ISS), and crew.  his document is the Fracture Control Plan for the International Space Station (ISS) Integrated  Habitat Holding Rack No. 1 (HHR #1). The provisions of this Plan shall be met to demonstrate  that the integrated HHR #1 is in compliance with NASA payload fracture control requirements.  subrack payloads and associated flight hardware for HHR #1 meets fracture control  requirements as an integrated structure for the payload mission increment and stage being  analyzed. This assessment scope will address all associated flight hardware, including: unique  integration structure supporting the subrack payloads in the rack, the integrated rack loading,  and the adequacy of the rack design provisions to accommodate the subrack payloads as  integrated into this mission.  This assessment will review the subrack payloads to ensure they meet fracture control  requirements in their integrated rack configuration. However, the subrack payloads are  expected to have independently met fracture control requirements as documented in their  respective Fracture Control Plans and Fracture Control Summary Reports. These reports and  plans will be referenced in the Fracture Control Summary Report for the integrated rack  payload.  fulfillment of these requirements are subject to examination, evaluation, and inspection to the  extent specified by the procuring installation or its designated representatives.

Distillation Assembly Shell   End and Centrifuge pick-up tube resulted in scoring   of Shell End.   Inspection of PCPA Housing indicated an   undocumented repair. The mounting tab, designed   as a machined-in feature, was welded on the   delivered housing.   Peristaltic pump tube failure in FCPA   Contractor-supplied RFTA and MTA tanks were   found to have inadequate welds in the tank shells.   Radiographic inspection revealed several areas of   generally poor fusion in the axial seam weld, as well   as areas of undercutting and several inclusions.   Process (cleaning) accident resulted in non-   repairable damage to one of three WSTA tanks.   Scoring determined to be in low stress area. MRB decision to use as-is.   Interfering tube was removed.   Initial assessment concluded the welded repair was acceptable as-is. PCPA   successfully completed random vibration testing. However, a handling   incident resulted in the failure of the weld. A new mounting tab was fabricated   and re-welded. Weld qual samples indicated strength in excess of parent   material\u2019s published minimums. NASGRO analysis was performed at   direction of Materials Lab personnel to assure safe life.   Determined to be caused by overpressure due to clog of microbial growth   within system. Norprene tube failure allowed unanticipated flow of microbial   sludge into DA and PCPA. Subsequent teardown for clean-up required repeat   of random vibration qualification tests. Re-assessment to account for   additional cycling was performed and indicates sufficient life to tolerate   another iteration of random vibration tests.   The tanks were subsequently rejected and a tank re-design effort was initiated.   The resulting tank is a simplified design that includes improved mounting   provisions and is fabricated from 316L stainless steel.   Due to a lack of spare hardware, the configuration was altered to include two   larger tanks previously used for VRA Flight Experiment. The small tanks of   the earlier configuration and the current large tanks are the same design and   differ only in the length of the tank.

Determined to be caused by buckling of Stationary Bowl inner shell under   vacuum and subsequent interference with rotating components. Post-mortem   inspection of failed ground unit revealed significant de-bonding between   honeycomb core and face sheets. The failed unit was in excess of 10 years old   and had undergone extensive vacuum cycling. Study performed to determine   buckling sensitivity of Stationary Bowl. (SvT Report 621-050-99-006).   Study indicated buckling factor could approach 1.0 when the effect of the   honeycomb core and outer face sheet is removed. However, in the nominal   configuration, the buckling factor under vacuum is no less than 13.2. Based   on the fact that the failed high-time ground unit was the first ever to fail in this   manner, the \u201cone-time-use\u201d VCD DA will use a new Stationary Bowl   manufactured at MSFC, and there are no safety implications to a failure of this   sort, it was determined that the existing honeycomb composite design for the   flight Stationary Bowl is acceptable. Further, vacuum cycle testing was   performed on a similar-to-flight Stationary Bowl and no deformation was   noted.

The AR&C VGS Flight Experiment is made up of three separate assemblies:  the Target, the Electronics, and the Sensor Assemblies. The Target is mounted on the  Spartan Satellite on the Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS). The other two  assemblies are attached to a GAS Canister which is also on the SFSS. The Electronics  Assembly is inside the GAS Can. The basic structure of the Target Assembly consists of  an aluminum isogrid structure covered by an aluminum skin (Figure 1). All parts of the  structure are attached together by means of steel (A-286) screws. The total mass of the  Target does not exceed 35 lb. As shown in Figure 2, the basic structure of the Sensor  Assembly consists of a 1 in. thick aluminum (6061-T6) plate to which the camera and its  support structure attach. These are then covered by a protective close-out-cover. This  box-like assembly is then attached to two aluminum (6061-T6) mounting brackets which  secure the entire assembly to the GAS Canister lid (t=0.625 in.). The total combined  mass of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment Sensor, Electronics Box, and Gas Can lid  does not exceed 100 lb. The AR&C VGS system attached to the SFSS is shown in  Figure 3.   racture control is used to insure that catastrophic failures due to pre-existing flaws do  not occur. The procedure begins by considering all parts and screening out those which  are clearly low-mass, contained/restrained, or fail-safe. Fracture control analysis is then  used on the remaining items to complete the selection of fracture critical parts. Safe life  analysis and non-destructive testing are then performed on these parts to assure that no  failures occur. This report describes the implementation of this procedure for the AR&C  VGS Flight Experiment. The requirements of NASA-STD-5003 are followed.  he AR&C VGS Flight Experiment flew aboard STS-87 in November 1997. This same  hardware will fly again aboard the Space Shuttle in the Orbiter's Cargo Bay. This report  will especially address the fracture assessment for the re-flight of this hardware.              in Figure 4. All parts are assumed to be fracture critical unless shown otherwise. The  parts not determined to be low-mass, contained/restrained, or fail-safe are analyzed using  NASA/FLAGRO to determine if part meets safe-life or low-risk requirements. This  analysis is discussed in Section 3.

Parts which are low-mass or contained/restrained have a  \"LM/CR\" in the disposition column. Parts which were shown to be fail-safe have a \"FS\"  in the disposition column. Parts which are fracture critical are identified with a \"CRIT\".  Three components, the Long Range Reflector, the Short Range Reflector, and the GAS  Canister lid, were classified as low-risk, \u201cLR\u201d.

The stresses for these analyses were taken from the Stress Report of the  AR&C VGS Flight Experiment (letter ED21(ED25-97-06) rev. A). The frequency of the  VGS Target, Sensor, and Electronics Box will be determined by a low-level sine sweep  prior to random vibration testing. A natural frequency of 200 Hz was assumed for these  analyses. The duration for testing was determined by adding the durations of the  following events: the component random vibration test (180 seconds), the system random  vibration test (180 seconds), and 12 cycles at 100% for the Thermal cycling. This  summation results in 72012 cycles. The loading spectrum for testing was determined  using a Rayleigh Distribution of these cycles based on a worst case loading. The loading  spectrum for flight was taken from the NASA/FLAGRO 2.0 Users\u2019 Guide, pp. 36-37,  \u201cGSFC Launch and Landing Spectrum for STS Payloads\u201d. As required by this Guide, a  multiplication factor of 6 was used on the spectrum duration. Therefore, the total  spectrum for each fracture analysis was made up of 1 test spectrum, one flight spectrum  for the STS-87 mission, and one flight spectrum for the new mission.  his section describes the fracture control analyses which were performed to show that  all structural components of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment met the fracture control  requirements     his section of the Report presents the results of the analyses performed on the fracture  critical components of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment. It describes also the safe-life  analysis performed for these parts and indicates the type of Non-Destructive Evaluation  (NDE) required. Table 2 summarizes the results of the NASA/FLAGRO analyses. The  analyses are located in the Appendices.  inspection, if four or more fasteners have positive margins with a factor of safety of 2.6,  then the pattern with one fewer fastener will be adequate with a factor of safety of 1.0.  The maintaining of a positive margin using the factor of 1.0 with the loss of one fastener  is the requirement for fail-safe. The Short Range Reflectors and the Long Range  Reflector Retainer Rings are attached by three #10 bolts, and by three #6 bolts,  respectively. The Stress Report indicates that one bolt is sufficient to carry the load,  therefore, these bolts are also fail-safe. All fasteners, therefore, were found to be fail-  safe. The other fail-safe components, by inspection, have redundant load paths.

Prior to re-flight the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment will be inspected. Specifically, all  fracture critical and low-risk fracture components will be inspected to ensure that no  surface damage is evident. It will be verified before re-flight that the structural  redundancy of fail-safe parts, including fasteners, is still intact. At a minimum,  verification will consist of a purposeful, visual inspection for evidence of structural  damage to all fail-safe parts at the lowest level of planned disassembly between missions.  If there is evidence of damage, the affected structure will be repaired or sufficiently  examined to verify intact redundancy.     Only three parts, the Sensor Mounting Bracket, the Target Frame, and the Target Cone,  were found to be fracture critical, and therefore required NDE. All other parts were  found to be low-mass, low-risk, contained/restrained, fail-safe, or otherwise not fracture  critical.

Generally, atomic oxygen erosion is measured in terms of mass loss per  area but can also be measured as thickness loss through recession.           nowing the density of a polymer, its mass loss, and the number of oxygen atoms that have  arrived, the atomic oxygen erosion yield can then be calculated based on mass loss. The term  erosion yield does not have meaning for polymers or materials that have nonvolatile oxidation  products. For such materials, such as silicones, there may be degradation by oxidation without  significant change in mass.     mass fraction ash in the material  surface area of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample

flexibility and low density, as well as  desirable electrical, thermal, and optical properties. Materials used on the exterior of spacecraft  are subjected to many environmental threats that can cause degradation. In LEO, these threats  include photon radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) radiation, x-rays,  solar wind particle radiation (electrons, protons), temperature effects and thermal cycling,  impacts from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD), spacecraft self-contamination, and  atomic oxygen. While all of these environmental exposures can cause serious degradation to  spacecraft components, atomic oxygen is a particularly serious structural, thermal, and optical  threat, especially to exterior polymeric spacecraft components. An example of the complete loss  of a Kapton\uf0d2 H (a DuPont\u2122 polyimide derived from pyromellitic acid dianhydride (PMDA) and  4,4\u2019-oxydianiline (ODA)) thermal blanket insulation layer, as well as degradation of other  polymeric materials caused by atomic oxygen erosion in LEO, is provided in by O\u2019Neal et al.

The objective of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to accurately determine  the atomic oxygen erosion yields of a wide variety of polymeric materials exposed for an                 extended period of time to the LEO space environment. The polymers range from those  commonly used for spacecraft applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, to more recently developed  polymers, such as high-temperature polyimide polymerization of monomer reactants (PMR).  Additional polymers were included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical  composition. Error analyses were conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield values for  each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight samples. This NASA Technical Handbook  provides details on the specific polymers flown, flight sample fabrication, pre-flight and post-  flight characterization techniques, and atomic oxygen fluence calculations, along with a  summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results and the corresponding erosion yield error  analyses.  lso included are ground-laboratory to in-space correlation data for the PEACE polymers in an  RF plasma asher, an atomic oxygen erosion yield predictive tool that was developed based on the  MISSE 2 PEACE flight data, tools for using atomic oxygen erosion yield data for spacecraft  durability applications, and lessons learned on the environment durability of spacecraft materials  from spaceflight experiments.   al., 1965). In NASA-TM-X-74335, U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976, NASA, the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the United States Air Force (USAF)  documented that atomic oxygen and its related reactions with materials exist in space. However,  the damaging effects of atomic oxygen on spacecraft materials were not recognized until the  Space Shuttle began flying missions in LEO. Although definitions vary greatly, according to one  source, LEO is considered to be satellite orbits between about 140 and 970 km above the surface  of Earth (low earth orbit, n.d. in Merriam-Webster). Early in-space observation that the residual  atmosphere was interacting with spacecraft surfaces came in part as a result of comparison of  day and night pictures of the Space Shuttle, as shown in Figure 2, Space Shuttle with the Bay  Oriented in the Direction of Travel (Ram Direction), where the glow from de-excitation atoms  and molecules leaving Shuttle surfaces oriented in the ram (forward-facing) direction are visible  in the night image (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA; Mende, 1984).     (b) Time-Lapsed Image Taken at Night with  \u201cShuttle Glow\u201d Visible                observations of increases in the diffuse reflectance of polymers related to surface texturing.  Specifically, after the first Shuttle mission (Space Transportation System (STS)-1) returned to  Earth, engineers examining materials surfaces in the payload bay found that exterior Kapton\uf0d2  television camera thermal blankets had been altered during flight from a glossy amber color to a  flat, milky yellow color (Leger, 1982; Leger, 1983). This was originally thought to be the result  of contamination, but high-resolution electron microscopy examination revealed a recessed,  carpet-like texture with a directional pattern associated with the vehicle velocity direction. It was  concluded that degradation was caused by oxidation of organic materials through high-velocity  collision with atmospheric atomic oxygen, resulting in volatile reaction products (carbon dioxide  (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), water (H2O), etc.,) that resulted in erosion and mass loss (Leger,  1982; Leger, 1983).   urther tests documented the rate of atomic oxygen erosion of commonly used spacecraft  polymers. The first dedicated atomic oxygen experiment was proposed for flight on STS-5 to  provide quantitative data on atomic oxygen reaction rates of materials. The reaction rate, given in  volume loss per incident oxygen atom (cm3/atom), is known as the atomic oxygen erosion yield.  This experiment was called the Effects of Oxygen Interactions with Materials I (Visentine et al.,  1985; Silverman, 1995, Part 1) or the Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions with Materials I, both  abbreviated as EOIM I. Many additional materials spaceflight experiments have since been  flown to assess atomic oxygen durability. The knowledge gained from these experiments of  atomic oxygen erosion of commonly used spacecraft materials has led to modifications in  spacecraft design in efforts to increase spacecraft durability in the LEO atomic oxygen  environment.   (O2). Short wavelength (\uf03c243 nm) solar radiation has sufficient energy to break the 5.12-eV O2  diatomic bond (Dickerson et al., 1979) in an environment where the mean free path is  sufficiently long (~108 m) that the probability of re-association or the formation of ozone (O3) is  small. Between the altitudes of 180 and 650 km, atomic oxygen is the most abundant species, as  shown in Figure 3, Density of Atmospheric Species as a Function of Altitude, from NASA-TM-  X-74-335 (NOAA 1976). This Figure and the data plotted in Figure 4, Atomic Oxygen Number  Density versus Altitude for Solar Minimum, Nominal (Standard Atmosphere), and Solar  Maximum Conditions, Figure 5, Atomic Oxygen Fluence per Year during a Solar Cycle, Figure  6, Average Molecular Weight as a Function of Altitude, and Figure 7, Kinetic Temperature of  LEO Atomic Oxygen as a Function of Altitude, show general trends. More accurate and recent  values can be obtained from Picone et al., (2002) and from the NASA Marshall Space Flight  Center\u2019s (MSFC\u2019s) solar activity website1. Although excited states of atomic oxygen can be  formed, their lifetimes are sufficiently short that the triple P (3P) ground state dominates the LEO  atomic oxygen formation and is dependent upon the O2 density and solar UV flux. Solar heating  of Earth\u2019s atmosphere from VUV radiation causes an increase in the number density of atoms at              a given altitude as Earth rotates from sunrise toward solar noon. Because the thermosphere  rotates with Earth, the solar-heated bulge in the atmosphere is pushed forward such that the peak  of the atomic oxygen density occurs in the late afternoon rather than at solar noon. As a  consequence, anti-solar-facing surfaces, such as the back side of solar arrays, receive 25 percent  more atomic oxygen fluence than the solar-facing surfaces as the spacecraft orbits Earth (Banks  et al., 1991).   change the atomic oxygen production rate and, therefore, the arriving flux on spacecraft surfaces.  Periods of high and low solar activity can change the arriving flux by several orders of  magnitude depending on altitude (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA2). (See Figure 4.) Because of this  uncertainty in solar activity, the atomic oxygen flux cannot be predicted accurately over short  durations of time. The average atomic oxygen number density varies as a result of the solar  activity consistent with the 11-year sunspot cycle (Hedin, 1987). (See Figure 5.) The Mass  Spectrometer-Incoherent Scattered-86 (MSIS-86) atmospheric model takes into account the  variation in number density with the 11-year solar cycle, and hence, the atomic oxygen flux and  fluence vary with the solar cycle (Hedin, 1987). Atomic oxygen can also be produced in other  planetary environments, such as the Mars orbital environment, where oxygen is present.

If the spacecraft is in an orbit that has  0\u00b0 inclination, then the average angle of attack of the atomic oxygen is perpendicular to surfaces  whose surface normal vector points in the direction of travel. However, most spacecraft have  orbits that are inclined with respect to Earth\u2019s equatorial plane. This causes the average angle of  attack of the arriving atomic oxygen to vary sinusoidally around the orbit as a result of the  vectoral contributions from the orbital spacecraft velocity vector and the atmosphere\u2019s co-  rotation velocity vector (de Groh and Banks, 1994). Because the co-rotation velocity vector is in  approximately the same direction as the orbital velocity vector, the actual oxygen atom impact  energy is slightly lower than what would be predicted based on the orbital velocity alone. In  addition, atomic oxygen atoms have thermal velocities associated with their Maxwell-Boltzman  velocity distribution at the high temperatures of LEO, typically around 1000 K (NASA-TM-  X-74335). The high-velocity tail of the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution actually allows a very  small fraction of the atomic oxygen atoms to catch up with the trailing surfaces of a LEO  spacecraft to produce a small flux that is orders of magnitude lower than the ram flux. Thus, the  thermal velocities of the atomic oxygen associated with their Maxwell-Boltzman velocity  distribution contribute as an additional vectoral component to the overall impact velocity of the  atomic oxygen, which results in an angular distribution of arrival directions.     f the three vectoral components are summed and averaged over a typical 400-km orbit at  28.5\uf0b0 inclination, the angular distribution of arriving atoms is as shown in Figure 8, Atomic  Oxygen Arrival Flux Relative to the Ram Direction for a 400-km Orbit at 28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and  1000-K Thermosphere, where the arrival distribution in the horizontal plane is shown as a               function of incidence angle for surfaces normal to the ram direction (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA).  The flux is plotted relative to the normal incident flux.  Figure 8\u2014Atomic Oxygen Arrival Flux Relative to the Ram Direction for a 400-km Orbit  at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere  Atomic oxygen can arrive at angles beyond 90\uf0b0 from the orbital direction. For example, Figure 9,  Polar Plot of Relative Atomic Oxygen Flux as a Function of the Angle between the Ram  Direction and the Normal of the Arrival Surface for a LEO Spacecraft in a 400-km Orbit at  28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere, shows that a surface whose normal is 98\uf0b0 with  respect to the ram direction receives approximately 4 percent of the flux that occurs for a surface  whose normal is parallel to the ram direction (Banks et al., 2004, AIAA). Note that, for angles  significantly off-normal incidence, Figure 9 provides a more accurate representation of the flux  than does Figure 8.                   Figure 9\u2014Polar Plot of Relative Atomic Oxygen Flux as a Function of the Angle between  the Ram Direction and the Normal of the Arrival Surface for a LEO Spacecraft in a 400-  km Orbit at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere  The flux of atomic oxygen at ISS altitudes is approximately 5.23\uf0b41013 atoms/cm2\u2219sec for normal  incident ram surfaces (at 400-km altitude averaged over the 11-year solar cycle) (Banks et al.,  1990). At ISS altitudes, the atomic oxygen fluence for a 15-year mission (averaged over the  variations with solar cycle) is approximately 4.5\uf0b41022 atoms/cm2. This was computed for a  15-year mission starting with the first ISS element launch (Zarya) on November 20, 1998,  assuming an altitude of 348 km, using Environmental WorkBench software. This fluence level is  high enough to cause significant degradation to a number of susceptible spacecraft materials,  posing a significant potential threat to the durability of long-duration spacecraft systems.   is often more useful to look at a more detailed plot in the region near tangential arrival, such as  for the LDEF spacecraft orbit, as shown in Figure 10, Atomic Oxygen Flux Relative to the Ram  Direction as a Function of Angle from the Ram Direction for the LDEF Spacecraft, (with data  for Figure 10 provided in Table 1, Numerical Values of Atomic Oxygen Flux Relative to the  Ram Direction as a Function of Angle from the Ram Direction for the LDEF Spacecraft)  (Bourassa and Gillis, 1991). As can be seen in Table 1, at 90\uf0b0 from the ram direction, the atomic  oxygen flux is 4.15 percent that for the ram direction. This relative flux also depends slightly on  the orbital inclination and on whether the surface is facing in an Earth-radial or Earth-tangential  direction because of vectoral contributions caused by the co-rotation of the thermosphere.

As can be seen in Figure  11, Energy Distribution of Atomic Oxygen Atoms as a Function of Altitude for a Circular Orbit  at 28.5\uf0b0 Inclination and 1000-K Thermosphere, the average impact energy is 4.5 (\uf0b11) eV for a  400-km orbit, and the impact energy decreases with altitude (Banks, 2004, AIAA).        Figure 11\u2014Energy Distribution of Atomic Oxygen Atoms as a Function of Altitude for a  Circular Orbit at 28.5\u00ba Inclination and 1,000-K Thermosphere   a LEO spacecraft travels through the part of its orbit that is the closest distance to Earth, it has  the highest velocity relative to the atomic oxygen in the residual atmosphere of Earth, i.e., it  travels faster than it does when it is farther from Earth. Therefore, for the low-altitude duration of  the spacecraft\u2019s orbit, the ram energy of impacting atomic oxygen is higher than it is during the  rest of the orbit (and also than it would be in a typical circular LEO orbit). Although erosion  yield dependence on ram energy has not been accurately measured for most polymers, there is  general agreement that erosion yield increases as ram energy increases.  oxygen flux at the perigee of its orbit. Figure 12, Elliptical Orbit Definition of Perigee, Apogee,  Earth Radius, and Orbital Velocity, shows the orbital parameters perigee (RP), apogee (RA), Earth  radius (RE), and orbital velocity at perigee (VP). A spacecraft in elliptical orbit can ultimately                  accumulate a very high atomic oxygen fluence if the perigee is low and the mission is of a long  duration. If this is the case, then spacecraft in highly elliptical orbits with low perigees could  experience significant erosion of organic materials on lengthy missions because of a combination  of increased ram energy and increased fluence of impacting atomic oxygen.  Figure 12\u2014Elliptical Orbit Definition of Perigee, Apogee, Earth Radius, and Orbital  Velocity  Subtracting Earth\u2019s atmospheric co-rotation velocity from the equatorial orbital velocity of a  spacecraft at perigee yields the highest ram energy (the energy at perigee) (EPE) for equatorial  orbits:    Altitude for Equatorial Elliptical Orbits, as expected, the maximum ram energy increases as  apogee altitude increases and decreases as perigee altitude increases.

This is primarily because most prior missions  occupied high-altitude orbits, where atomic oxygen densities are inconsequential.      orbital velocity. These include chemical reaction with surface molecules, elastic scattering,  scattering with partial or full thermal accommodation, and recombination or excitation of ram  species (Gregory, 1986). Atomic oxygen can react with polymers, carbon, and many metals to  form oxygen bonds with atoms on the exposed surface. For most polymers, hydrogen  abstraction, oxygen addition, or oxygen insertion can occur (Dever, 1991; Dever, 2005), as  shown in Figure 14, Atomic Oxygen Reaction Pathways with Polymers. With continued atomic  oxygen exposure, all oxygen interaction pathways eventually lead to volatile oxidation products.  This results in gradual erosion of hydrocarbon or halocarbon material, with the exception of  silicone materials. The amount of erosion of a hydrocarbon or halocarbon material that is  acceptable depends on the material\u2019s function and functional performance requirements and on  the associated margins and factors of safety relevant to the specific material and mission.               example is provided in Figure 15, Surface Oxygen Content of CTFE as a Function of Atomic  Oxygen in an RF Plasma Asher, where the surface oxygen content, measured using x-ray  photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as a function of atomic oxygen exposure level is provided for  chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) exposed to atomic oxygen in an RF air plasma asher (Mata et al.,  2003).            Figure 15\u2014Surface Oxygen Content of CTFE as a Function of Atomic Oxygen in an RF  Plasma Asher  Silicones, a family of commonly used spacecraft materials, are an exception to polymeric  materials that erode away with atomic oxygen exposure. With atomic oxygen exposure,  oxidation reactions cause the surface of silicones to oxidize and volatilize their hydrocarbon  content and convert to a hardened silica-based surface layer, which is resistant to atomic oxygen  erosion (de Groh et al., 2006, JSR). In this oxidation and volatilization process, silicones tend to  form a surface that is under tension relative to the underlying polymer. Eventually, with  sufficient fluence, the surfaces can form microscopic mud-tile-like cracks. A sample flown as  part of the Evaluation of Oxygen Interactions with Materials III (EOIM III) provides an example  of mud-tile cracking in response to exposure to a low fluence of atomic oxygen in LEO (de Groh  and McCollum, 1995). (See Figure 16, DC 93-500 Silicone Exposed to LEO Atomic Oxygen as  Part of the EOIM III Shuttle Experiment.)3 This sample was exposed to an atomic oxygen  fluence of 2.3\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2 during STS-46. Even with volatilization of hydrocarbons,  silicones often do not lose mass (Hung and Cantrell, 1994), and some silicones actually gain  mass during atomic oxygen exposure. Therefore, the atomic oxygen durability of silicones  should not be based on erosion, as with other spacecraft polymers. Another consequence of  atomic oxygen interaction with some silicones is the production of dark contamination on  neighboring surfaces in LEO, particularly with UV exposure (Banks et al., 2000; de Groh and  McCue, 1999).                 (b) Post-Flight with Mud-Tile Cracking  Observed  Figure 16\u2014DC 93-500 Silicone Exposed to LEO Atomic Oxygen as Part of the EOIM III  Shuttle Experiment  that are oriented in a fixed position with respect to the ram direction gradually develop left-  standing cones that point in the direction of arriving atomic oxygen. Thus, the microscopic  roughness of the surfaces increases with time. Because the erosion of one location is independent  of any other location and because the atomic oxygen arrives at microscopically random locations  on the surface, the development of surface roughness obeys Poisson statistics: as the atomic  fluence increases, the surface roughness increases as the square root of the fluence (Banks et al.,  2001). Figure 17, Scanning Electron Microscope Images of Directed LEO Atomic Oxygen  Textured Materials, shows examples of atomic-oxygen-textured surfaces of three materials from  the EOIM III and LDEF spaceflight experiments after fixed-orientation exposure to atomic  oxygen in LEO (Banks et al., 2004, MRS). In addition to polymer thickness loss, such texturing  causes an increase in diffuse reflectance and a decrease in specular transmittance of polymers  (Banks et al., 1985, AIAA).

Computational modeling of the surfaces also predicts the development of  such surface cones (Banks et al., 2001; Banks et al., 1997). Atomic oxygen textured surfaces  have significant biomedical applications because they have greatly decreased water contact  angles and cell attachment (Banks et al., 2001; Berger et al., 2007).  he peak-to-valley distance of the cones increases with atomic oxygen fluence as the square root  of the fluence (Banks et al., 2001). Figure 18, Scanning Electron Microscope Images at Protected  Mesas of Directed LEO Atomic Oxygen Textured Materials, shows the heights of the cones  relative to the average erosion depths for pyrolytic graphite, polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H, and Teflon\uf0d2  FEP at protected mesa locations (Banks et al., 2004, MRS).

The particles remain in contact with  each other and gradually, as more are exposed, shield the underlying polymer content from  further atomic oxygen erosion, unless they are loosened or moved by external contact or  abrasion. Thus, the erosion yield of such polymers can gradually decrease with atomic oxygen  fluence.  t is interesting to note that the 100 plane of carbon in the form of single crystal class IIa  diamond does not erode with atomic oxygen exposure (Banks and Stueber, 1997; Shpilman et  al., 2010). This is thought to be because of the formation of a protective surface formed by close-  together oxygen atoms that have replaced hydrogen atoms at the terminations of tetrahedrally  coordinated carbon on the external surface of diamond.                      he most common approach to protecting susceptible spacecraft materials from atomic oxygen  erosion is to coat the material with a thin atomic oxygen protective film, such as a metal, metal  oxide, or fluoropolymer-filled metal oxide protective coating (Banks et al., 1984; Banks et al.,  2002; Dever et al.,1996; Goode et al., 1994; Rutledge and Mihelcic, 1990). Thin film coatings of  silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), indium tin oxide (ITO), germanium (Ge),  silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and gold (Au) with thicknesses ranging from a few hundred  angstroms to more than 100 nm are typically applied by sputter deposition or vapor deposition  (Dever et al., 2005). Although metal oxide coatings as thin as ~5.0 nm can provide atomic  oxygen protection on extremely smooth surfaces, usually thicknesses of ~100 nm are used to  provide coverage over irregularities such as debris, pits, and rills on polymer surfaces (Dever et  al., 2005). It is critical that the substrate to be coated be extremely smooth and free from surface  roughness, such as scratches, rills, pits, and abrupt ridges, to prevent pin windows from  developing in protective coatings. The application of 130-nm SiO2 protective coatings on  Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide can frequently reduce the rate of weight loss caused by atomic oxygen  erosion of Kapton\uf0d2 to less than 1 percent of that of unprotected Kapton\uf0d2 (Rutledge and Olle,  1993). Coatings that are factors thicker than 100 nm can more easily crack or spall because of  their intrinsic stress or their inability to conform with flexure compression or expansion at the  polymer substrate interface (Dever et al., 2005). The addition of small amounts of fluoropolymer  to metal oxide coatings allows greater strain-to-failure ratios in the coatings. Such coatings can  be deposited by co-sputter deposition of SiO2 and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon\uf0d2  (Banks et al., 1985, AIAA; Banks et al., 1984). Because only limited flexibility of the solar array  blankets is needed at array segment hinge locations, 130-nm-thick SiO2 magnetron sputter  deposition coatings are used on Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide solar array blankets on the ISS (Rutledge  and Olle, 1993).  surface can result in defects in the protective coating. These coating defects can provide  pathways for atomic oxygen attack, and undercutting erosion of the substrate can occur, even  under directed ram atomic oxygen exposure in LEO. Figure 19, Scanning Electron Microscope  Images of Undercutting Erosion at Defect Sites in Aluminized Kapton\uf0d2 Exposed to LEO on the  LDEF, shows scanning electron microscope images of LEO-exposed aluminized-Kapton\uf0d2 from  the LDEF at sites of pinhole and crack defects in the Al protective coating (de Groh and Banks,  1994; Banks et al., 2004, AIAA). After removal of the Al coating, undercut cavities developed  during flight at the coating defect sites, as shown in Figure 19 (b).                (b) After Chemical Removal of the Al  Coating  Figure 19\u2014Scanning Electron Microscope Images of Undercutting Erosion at Defect Sites  in Aluminized Kapton\u00ae Exposed to LEO on the LDEF   Figure 20, Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Degradation of the Solar Array Wing Blanket Box  Cover on the ISS after 1 Year of LEO Space Exposure, where atomic oxygen undercutting  erosion has severely degraded the P6 Truss port solar array wing two-surface aluminized-  Kapton\uf0d2 blanket box cover on the ISS (Banks et al., 2004, JSR). Therefore, the atomic oxygen  durability of polymers that are protected by thin-film coatings is largely dependent upon the  number and size of pinhole and scratch defects in the protective coatings. The growth of  undercut cavities has been studied for polymer films coated on one side or both sides through the  use of Monte Carlo computational modeling (Banks et al., 1998; Banks et al., 1990; Banks et al.,  1992; Banks and Stueber, 1997; Banks et al., 2003; Banks et al., 2004, JSR). Modeling the  double-coated Kapton\uf0d2 solar array wing blanket box covers on the ISS indicated that the extent  of undercutting damage would have been significantly less, because of less scattering in the  undercut cavity, if the blanket had been coated only on the front (space-facing) side and not on  both sides (Banks et al., 2004, JSR). The model predictions are shown in Figure 21, Monte Carlo  Computational Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Erosion Predictions for a 45\u00b0-from-Perpendicular  Angle of Attack of Atomic Oxygen at a Crack or Scratch Defect of the Aluminized Kapton\uf0d2  Surfaces.             Figure 20\u2014Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Degradation of the Solar Array Wing Blanket  Box Cover on the ISS after 1 Year of LEO Space Exposure    Figure 21\u2014Monte Carlo Computational Atomic Oxygen Undercutting Erosion Predictions  for a 45\u00b0-from-Perpendicular Angle of Attack of Atomic Oxygen at a Crack or Scratch  Defect of the Aluminized Kapton\u00ae Surfaces  he sensitivity of a hydrocarbon material to reaction with atomic oxygen is quantified by the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of the material. The atomic oxygen erosion yield is the volume of a  material that is removed (through oxidation) per incident oxygen atom and is measured in units  of cm3/atom. The atomic oxygen erosion yield is also often referred to as the recession rate and,  in the past, has been called atomic oxygen reaction efficiency. The most well-characterized  atomic oxygen erosion yield is that of polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H, which has an erosion yield of  3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom for LEO 4.5-eV atomic oxygen (Banks et al., 1985, TSF; Visentine et al.,  1985; Koontz et al., 1995; Silverman, 1995). As atomic oxygen erosion of polymers in LEO is a  serious threat to spacecraft performance and durability, it is essential to understand the atomic  oxygen erosion yield of polymers for spacecraft applications so that the durability of materials  being considered for spacecraft design can be predicted. Because spaceflight opportunities are                       rare, expensive, space-limited, and time-consuming, ground laboratory testing is often relied  upon for spacecraft material environmental durability prediction. However, differences exist  between ground facilities and actual space exposures, which may result in material-dependent  differences in rates of reactions. Therefore, actual spaceflight atomic oxygen erosion yield data  (volume loss in cm3 per incident oxygen atom) are needed to best assess the durability of a  material for spacecraft mission applicability. In addition, data from actual materials spaceflight  experiments can be used to determine correlations between exposures in ground test facilities  and space exposure, allowing for more accurate predictions of in-space materials performance  based on ground facility testing.     laboratory atomic oxygen exposure are mass loss and recession depth. Advantages and  disadvantages to both techniques are discussed below.   uses mass loss measurements. The mass loss measurements should be made by weighing  vacuum-dehydrated samples before and after atomic oxygen exposure, as described in  ASTM E 2089-00, Standard Practices for Ground Laboratory Atomic Oxygen Interaction  Evaluation of Materials for Space Applications. Measurements for dehydration are to be  performed using equipment calibrated to national requirements for accuracy. The erosion yield  of the sample is calculated through the following equation:      et al., 1985, TSF; Visentine et al., 1985; Koontz et al., 1995; Silverman, 1995, P1), it is  commonly used as a witness sample to compute the atomic oxygen fluence during flight  experiments in LEO. In ground laboratory equipment, such as an RF plasma asher or an atomic  oxygen beam facility, the energy, flux, and arrival of atomic oxygen can vary from that in LEO.  For example, the Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluence for a thermal energy plasma measured in a ground  laboratory facility is not the actual number of atoms/cm2 striking the surface, because thermal  energy atoms (\u22480.04 eV) require orders of magnitude more atoms to erode as much material as  Ey = atomic oxygen erosion yield of test sample (cm3/atom)  \uf044Ms = mass loss of test sample (g)  As = surface area of test sample exposed to atomic oxygen (cm2)  s = density of test sample (g/cm3)  \uf072  F = fluence of atomic oxygen (atoms/cm2).

Therefore, in a ground facility, the effective fluence (FE) of the  exposure is the atomic oxygen fluence in LEO that would produce the same amount of erosion in  the ground-based facility (ASTM E 2089-00).      F  FE = atomic oxygen effective fluence in ground laboratory facility (atoms/cm2)  \uf044MK = mass loss of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample (g)  AK = surface area of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample exposed to atomic oxygen (cm2)  K = density of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample (1.4273 g/cm3) (de Groh et al., 2008)  \uf072  EK = erosion yield of Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample in LEO (3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom).    ne of the critical issues with using mass loss data to obtain accurate erosion yield data is that  dehydrated mass measurements are needed. Many polymer materials, such as Kapton\uf0d2, are very  hygroscopic and can absorb up to several percent of their weight in moisture and, therefore, can  fluctuate in mass with humidity and temperature. Small changes in mass loss related to atomic  oxygen erosion can be difficult to measure accurately if the state of hydration is variable;  weighing the samples in a dehydrated state largely eliminates this source of error. Therefore, for  accurate mass loss measurements, it is necessary that the samples be fully dehydrated, e.g., in a  vacuum desiccator, before both pre-flight and post-flight measurements. Full dehydration for  samples \u2264127 \u00b5m (\u22645 mil) thick requires a minimum of 48 hours for vacuum dehydration at  pressures below 200 mtorr.   a Function of Time after Removal from Vacuum Dehydration, provides an example of a  rehydration curve for Kapton\uf0d2 H shortly after removal from a vacuum dehydration environment.  The graph shows the fractional mass gained during rehydration of a 127-\u00b5m- (5-mil-) thick  Kapton\uf0d2 H film after dehydration in a vacuum desiccator for \uf03e72 hours.

This is partly because some flight experiments, such as short-duration Shuttle flight  experiments, were exposed to low atomic oxygen fluences on orbit, but variations in much of the  early LEO space data also occurred because some erosion yield data were not determined based  on dehydrated mass measurements, introducing large error for hygroscopic materials, especially  for low fluence exposures or low erosion yield samples.    step heights. The erosion or recession depth can be measured from a protected surface using  profilometry with a stylus profilometer or with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical  interferometry, or atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Minton, 1995). If the surface is protected by  an intimate tin mask or mesh or a protective film, the erosion yield can be calculated through the  following equations:                                    profilometry, SEM, and optical interferometry, are not sensitive enough or have other faults. For  example, an SEM is not suited for obtaining accurate erosion depth measurements (z-direction)  and making stylus measurements on soft polymers can be problematic. One technique that  maintains accuracy for very small step-height measurements is AFM. AFM can have a lateral  resolution of 10 to 20 \u00c5 and sub-angstrom vertical resolution (Howland and Benatar, 1996).  y = erosion step height (cm)  F = atomic oxygen fluence in LEO (atoms/cm2)  FE = atomic oxygen effective fluence in ground laboratory facility (atoms/cm2).    etal meshes, such as a stainless-steel or nickel-etched meshes, have been used to protect  surfaces from atomic oxygen attack, resulting in step-height changes between the eroded areas  and covered areas (Minton, 1995). A frequent problem with using a mesh is that it needs to be  very thin and in close contact with the surface of the polymer for accurate step-height  measurement. However, it is very difficult to place a thin mesh in close contact with a polymer.  In de Groh et al. (2001, AFM), the quantification of the error associated with the thickness and  closeness of a mesh with respect to the polymer, i.e., the distance of the exposed mesh surface to  the protected polymer surface, is reviewed. It was found that the height of the mesh with respect  to the protected surface plays a critical role in the error of erosion yield measurements.    oatings such as metals, SiO2, and Al2O3 are listed as serving as potential effective masks as  long as the coatings are \uf0b320 nm thick (Minton, 1995). The problem with the mask technique is  that the thickness of the coating needs to be very accurately known for low fluence exposures,  and the coating must end cleanly and sharply. A gradual thinning of the protective coating at its  margin, which commonly occurs, will contribute to step-height errors (de Groh et al., 2001,  AFM).    involves pre-flight protection of the sample surface using small, isolated particles in contact with  the sample surface (de Groh, et al., 2001, AFM). These particles, such as salt crystals or mica  powder, are applied either by salt spraying or mica dusting, resulting in isolated protective  particles. The particles are removed post-flight, e.g., the salt is washed off with distilled water  and the surface is then dried with nitrogen gas; erosion depth step-height or recession          Fy  E           measurements are then obtained using AFM. Salt-spraying and mica-dusting techniques and  AFM profiling are discussed in detail in de Groh et al., (2001, AFM). Figure 23, High-  Magnification Image of a Graphite Epoxy Composite Sample Flown as Part of the EOIM III  Experiment aboard STS-46 and Exposed to an Atomic Oxygen Fluence of 2.3\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2,  is an example of how a small particle can protect the underlying polymer from atomic oxygen  erosion (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM).

A uniform distribution of small cubic crystals is ideal.  Experiments conducted for the development of the PEACE Polymers experiment have shown  that salt spraying can result in the formation of a variety of different salt particles (de Groh et al.,  2001, AFM), such as small or large cubic crystals, oval or asymmetric spherical particles,  crystals with salt \u201crings\u201d around them, and ring deposits that form doughnut-shaped appearances  after drying. Figure 24, Different Types of Sodium Chloride Salt Particles Formed on a Kapton\uf0d2  HN Substrate during Salt-Spraying, shows examples of these different salt particle formations  (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). Issues related to salt rings and possible condensation build-up  effects on experiments in the Shuttle bay (while in the Cape Canaveral environment) are  provided by de Groh et al. (2001, AFM).

Error analyses were performed for this technique and for the traditional  erosion yield determination technique based on mass loss; as expected, both were highly  dependent on atomic oxygen fluence. Also, the recession technique was found to be very  dependent on protective particle height and to be more accurate than the mass loss technique for  protective particles <17 \u00b5m thick (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). For example, for a fluence of  1\uf0b41019 atoms/cm2, the probable error in atomic oxygen erosion yield found using the AFM  recession technique (using a 10-\u00b5m-thick protective particle) is approximately 60 percent of the  error in the erosion yield found using the mass loss technique (7.74 percent versus 13.1 percent,  respectively) (de Groh et al., 2001, AFM). These error analysis results stress the importance of  using small particles in contact with the test material, such as cubic salt crystals, or very thin  mica dust particles.

For more than a decade,  MISSE has studied the long-duration environmental durability of spacecraft materials and  devices in the LEO environment through a series of materials spaceflight experiments. The                  overall objective of MISSE is to test the stability and durability of materials and devices in the  space environment to gain valuable knowledge of the performance of materials in space, as well  as to enable lifetime prediction of new materials and components that may be used in future  spaceflight.   containers, called Passive Experiment Containers (PECs) (de Groh et al., 2009). (See Figure 25,  Pre-Flight Photograph of MISSE PEC 2). The PECs are exposed to the space environment on the  exterior of the ISS (de Groh, 2010). During transport to the ISS on the Space Shuttle, the PECs  are closed with the samples facing each other for protection; once the Space Shuttle reaches the  ISS, the PECs are attached to its exterior during an extravehicular activity (EVA) and opened  back-to-back, exposing the samples to space (de Groh et al., 2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006,  NSMMS; Groh et al., 2009). (See Figure 26, During a spacewalk on August 16, 2001, astronaut  Patrick Forrester installs MISSE PEC 2 on the ISS Quest Airlock, and Figure 27, MISSE 1  during an EVA in January 2003 after 17 Months of Space Exposure.) The PECs are retrieved  after 1 or more years of space exposure and returned to Earth for post-flight evaluations of the  experiments.

Each of these orientations  provides different space environmental exposures. For example, samples in a ram orientation  receive the greatest amount of atomic oxygen exposure combined with solar radiation exposure,  while those in a wake orientation receive solar radiation exposure with very little atomic oxygen  exposure. Zenith-facing samples receive the highest amount of solar radiation and grazing  atomic oxygen exposure, and nadir-facing samples receive little solar exposure (only ambient  reflected solar exposure) with grazing atomic oxygen exposure. Ten MISSE PECs have flown,  along with a small passive tray called the Optical Reflector Materials Experiment III Ram/Wake  (ORMatE-III R/W).

MISSE has provided rapid  access to space, producing mission-critical solar cell performance data for groups such as the  Naval Research Center (NRL) (Walters et al., 2005). MISSE solar cell experiments have  provided anomaly resolution data for on-orbit spacecraft, real-time data that have enabled DoD  mission hardware to be designed and built in a timely manner, and on-orbit data for ground-test  data validation. The Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Air Force Research Laboratory (WPAFB  AFRL) has also seen immeasurable benefits from MISSE, such as new higher power solar cell  technology, electromagnetic-shielding nano-materials, and improved understanding of atomic  oxygen erosion (Juhl, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). Boeing has obtained space radiation dose  measurements through experiments on MISSE (Wert, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). The  Aerospace Corporation has found that MISSE experiments reduce the risk of incorporating new  technology into future satellite systems and provide an inexpensive way to evaluate vendor space  readiness on a small scale (Palusinski, 2010; de Groh et al., 2011). The Aerospace Corporation  uses MISSE data to educate vendors on surviving space environments, with an emphasis on  material processes (quality, packaging, contamination, etc.) (Palusinski, 2010; de Groh et al.,  2011). Like many MISSE investigators, The Aerospace Corporation uses the MISSE flight data           n summary, MISSE is the longest running technology development and materials testing project  on the ISS, resulting in many impacts on spacecraft materials and device design choices.

The purpose of the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was to accurately determine the atomic oxygen erosion  yield of a wide variety of polymeric materials exposed to the LEO space environment for an  extended period of time (de Groh et al., 2001, AIAA). The polymers range from those commonly  used for spacecraft applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, to more recently developed polymers,  such as high-temperature polyimide PMR. Additional polymers were included to explore erosion  yield dependence upon chemical composition, with the goal of developing a predictive model for  erosion yield.    9. MISSE 2 POLYMER EROSION AND CONTAMINATION  EXPERIMENT POLYMERS  t was decided that mass loss was the best measurement technique for this flight experiment  because many of the PEACE Polymers are composed of multiple thin-film layers, as described in  section 9.2.2 of this NASA Technical Handbook, and erosion can occur through multiple layers  (de Groh et al., 2008). In addition, individual layers can be so fragile after erosion that recession  depth measurements would be impossible to obtain. With mass loss measurements, an average  mass of the fragile pieces and layers and underlying non-eroded supportive layers can be  obtained. Extensive error analysis was conducted to determine the error in the erosion yield  values for each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight samples. The uncertainty values are  provided in section 9.3.6 of this NASA Technical Handbook, and the specifics of the error  analysis are provided in Appendix B of this NASA Technical Handbook. In addition to the LEO  erosion yield of the flight samples, optical and thermal properties of the flight samples were also  obtained post-flight and compared with control sample properties, as reviewed in section 9.3.7 of  this NASA Technical Handbook. Appendices C and D of this NASA Technical Handbook  provide the optical properties and summary pages for each individual flight sample. Details on  the specific polymers flown, flight sample fabrication, pre-flight and post-flight characterization  techniques, and atomic oxygen fluence determination are discussed in this section, along with a  summary of the atomic oxygen erosion yield results.  range of polymeric materials and bonding types. The polymers chosen included those commonly  used for spacecraft applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP and white Tedlar\uf0d2, as well as more  recently developed polymers, such as high-temperature PMR. Pyrolytic graphite and polymers  such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) and cellulose acetate (CA) were also included based solely on  their chemical composition to provide LEO erosion yield data for modeling purposes. Two  polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H samples were included to serve as atomic oxygen fluence witness samples.  The 40 polymers and pyrolytic graphite, their associated polymer abbreviations, and the MISSE  serial numbers are listed in Table 3, MISSE PEACE Polymers List.

Most polymers were in  thin-film form and typically ranged from 0.0025 to 0.051 cm thick. Samples were punched into  circular discs using a double-bow punch cutter and an Arbor press.  2-E5-14), typically used as lens material, was ordered from a manufacturer in 2.54-cm-diameter,  0.079-cm-thick samples. Pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25) was also ordered in 2.54-cm-diameter  pieces, 0.203 cm thick. Hysol\uf0d2 EA 956 epoxy (EP, 2-E5-19) was purchased as a two-part kit.  Although epoxy is available as reasonably mixed systems, care should be exercised to ensure  that the mixtures are accurate so that the epoxy results in verifiable characteristics, as specified.  Flight samples were fabricated by mixing and curing the epoxy and then carefully sawing out  2.54-cm-diameter samples from brittle sheets of cured epoxy. The thickness of the epoxy flight  sample was \uf0bb0.231 cm. Polyethylene oxide (PEO, 2-E5-17) was purchased as a powder and  fabricated into sheet material by pressing the powder with heated plates using a Carver  Laboratory Press. To keep the PEO from sticking to the plates, two sheets of Kapton\uf0d2 were  placed between the press plates and the PEO powder. The PEO powder was pressed at 10.5  metric tons for 5 to 10 sec with the press plates heated to 260 \u00b0C. Although the press pressure  and temperate are somewhat arbitrary, what is important is the density of the individual sample,  because PEO erosion yields for samples of different densities are simply inversely proportional  to the ratio of the densities, so that a PEO sample of half the density would have twice the  erosion yield. After pressing and cooling the PEO, the Kapton\uf0d2 sheets were carefully separated  from the PEO sheet, which was between 0.74 and 0.94 cm thick, from which 2.54-cm-diameter  samples were punched. High-temperature polyimide resin (PI, 2-E5-34), also known as PMR-15,  was fabricated by the Polymers Branch at GRC in 2.54-cm-diameter, 0.030-cm-thick pieces.  Poly-(p-phenylene terephthalamide) (PPD-T, 2-E5-8), also known as Kevlar\uf0d2 29, was obtained  in fabric form, from which flight samples were cut. Al discs were applied to the backs of the  flight samples and wrapped around the non-spaced exposed edges to protect against fraying or  loss of small filaments. Polyphenylene isophthalate (PPPA), also known as Nomex\uf0d2, was  supplied as 0.005-cm-thick sheets of paper, from which flight samples were punched.          ISSEs 1 and 2 were originally planned as a 1-year mission. The expected atomic oxygen  fluence for a 1-year exposure on the ISS is 3.28\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 for directed atomic oxygen  exposed surfaces, based on a mission launch date of June 2001, a 400-km circular orbit, and a  51.6\u00b0 inclination. For many of the thin-film polymers, a single layer would be completely eroded  away after a 1-year mission. In addition, flight experiments are not always retrieved on the  original planned date and can be left in space much longer. Depending on the polymer thickness  and estimated erosion yield, stacking of several layers was necessary for many polymers. The  total number of layers to be stacked for flight was determined based on the amount of material  that would theoretically survive a 3-year mission (three times the duration of the original planned  mission).         causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the mass change; a sample with the lowest possible mass is  ideal so that the mass loss is a significant percent of the total mass of the sample. With this in  mind, two different sets of samples were stacked together for flight. The first set, called Part A,  included the number of sample layers needed to survive an atomic oxygen exposure period of  1.5 years (chosen to be 0.5 years longer than the mission). The second set, called Part B, was  added behind the weighed set and included the number of additional sample layers needed to  survive a 3-year mission.   determined based on the estimated erosion yield of each polymer and the expected atomic  oxygen fluence for a 1.5-year mission, computed to be 4.55\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2. The total number of  layers to be stacked together as one flight sample (Parts A and B) was calculated based on the  expected atomic oxygen fluence for a 3-year mission, computed to be 9.1\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 (twice  the 1.5-year fluence). The additional unweighed set (Part B) was placed behind the weighed set  (Part A) in the flight hardware. Figure 31, Flight Sample Setup, shows an illustration of the flight  sample.    or example, the estimated erosion yield for CA is 6.8\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom (Integrity Testing  Laboratory Inc., 1998). Based on this erosion yield, the estimated thickness loss for 1.5 years in  LEO is 0.031 cm. The thickness of one sample layer is only 0.005 cm; therefore, seven sample  layers were stacked for mass measurements. A total of 0.062 cm was expected to be eroded away  after 3 years, so 13 total layers were stacked for flight (the 7 weighed Part A layers plus 6  additional unweighed Part B layers).   of stock material (or from the same batch of fabricated material) and characterized. All  individual sample layers were carefully scribe marked at the edges to indicate sample  identification, orientation (front), flight or backup sample, and whether the sample had been  vacuum heat treated. The backup sample, prepared in case something happened to the flight  sample before installation in the flight hardware, was used as a ground-control sample. It is  typically referred to as the control sample.    Flight Sample Part A  (enough layers to  survive 1.5 yr)  Flight Sample Part B  (enough additional  layers to survive  a total of 3 yr)           amples to be flown in the space environment need to meet outgas requirements as outlined in  ASTM E 595, Standard Test Method for Total Mass Loss and Collected Volatile Condensable  Materials from Outgassing in a Vacuum Environment. This test method evaluates, under  carefully controlled conditions, the changes in mass (total mass loss (TML)) of a test specimen  exposed to a temperature of 125 \uf0b0C under vacuum and the mass of the products that leave the  specimen and condense on a cooler collector plate set at a temperature of 25 \uf0b0C (collected  volatile condensable materials (CVCMs)) (ASTM E 595). MISSE management decided that  materials being flown as part of MISSEs 1 and 2 should meet the historical screening levels of  <1.00 percent TML and <0.10 percent CVCM. Of the 41 PEACE polymers, 10 did not meet the  outgas requirements, based on previous testing or because they had not been tested. It was  decided that these polymers could be flown if they were vacuum heat treated before flight to  remove volatile products. Vacuum heat treatment was conducted at MSFC at a pressure of 7\uf0b410\u2013  5 Pa. Ideally, samples were to be vacuum baked for 24 hours at 125 \uf0b0C (similar to ASTM E 595),  but some polymers were heated at lower temperatures because of low maximum operating  temperatures. Table 4, Vacuum Heat Treated MISSE PEACE Polymers, lists the vacuum heat  treated samples, their maximum operating temperatures, and the vacuum heat treatment  temperature and time.

For this reason, the four layers of the flight sample were stacked together (after mass  measurements were obtained) and held flat for flight by being mounted in an Al holder similar to  the one used for the Kevlar\uf0d2 fabric.    vacuum heat treatment, where applicable). The Part A sample sets were dehydrated in a vacuum  desiccator maintained at a pressure of 8.0 to 13.3 Pa with a mechanical roughing pump.  Typically, 5 flight sample sets and their corresponding control samples were placed together in a  desiccator (a total of 10 sample sets). The sets of samples were placed in the desiccator and left  under vacuum for a minimum of 4 days. The vacuum desiccator was put back under vacuum            immediately after a sample set was removed to keep the other samples in the desiccator under  vacuum. Previous tests showed that the mass of a given dehydrated sample was not adversely  affected if the desiccator was opened and quickly closed again and pumped back down to  approximately 20 Pa before that sample was weighed. This process allows multiple samples to  be dehydrated together. Three mass readings for each sample was obtained and averaged, and the  time at which each sample was first exposed to air was recorded, along with the times at which it  was weighed. The total time it took to obtain the three readings for one sample, starting from the  time air was let into the desiccator, was typically 5 minutes. The samples were weighed using  either a Mettler Balance 3M (0.000001-g sensitivity) or a Sartorius Balance R160P (0.00001-g  sensitivity), depending on total sample mass. Records were kept of the following: the sequence  of sample weighing, the number of layers in each Part A set, the time under vacuum before  weighing, the temperature and humidity in the room, the time air was let into the desiccator, the  time each sample set was taken out of the desiccator, and the time of each weighing. The same  procedure and sequence were repeated with the same samples post-flight.    because of processing variations among the sheets of the materials. To obtain more accurate  density values control for this variation, density measurements were obtained for 36 of the 41  polymers using calibrated density gradient columns. Density gradient columns were created in a  50-mL buret with varying proportions of either cesium chloride (CsCl), \uf072 \uf0bb 2 g/cm3, andH2O, \uf072  = 1 g/cm3, for less dense polymers, or carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), \uf072 = 1.594 g/cm3, and  bromoform (CHBr3), \uf072 = 2.899 g/cm3, for denser polymers. Because of the variation in density of  the polymers, numerous columns with variations in initial mixed solutions were made that  allowed a wide range of densities to be determined. Glass standards of known densities  (\uf0b10.0001 g/cm3) were placed in the column and allowed to settle, and then small pieces of  various polymers were placed in the columns. A curve was fit to the positions and relative  known densities of the glass standards. Plotting the positions of the test polymers on this curve  yielded density values for each material (de Groh et al., 2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006,  NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2008). The density values for approximately half of the polymers were  determined based on averages obtained from more than one density column.  ive polymers either had density values out of the range of the density columns or were of a  form not easily sectioned for density column measurements. The densities for these materials  (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), PPPA, and PG)  were obtained from referenced literature or manufacturers\u2019 Material Safety Data Sheets  (MSDSs). The densities of the PEACE Polymer samples, along with uncertainty values, are  provided in Table 5, Density Gradient Column Data for the PEACE Polymers.

Each sample was assigned a serial number to indicate its  position; for example, ABS, with serial number 2-E5-6, represents the sample in MISSE PEC 2,  Tray E5, sample position 6. Five other samples (four DC 93-500 silicone samples and one  atomic oxygen scattering chamber) were also on this tray in positions 2-E5-1 through 2-E5-5.  Sample positions were assigned based on anticipated erosion yields or by grouping samples by  polymer family, such as the polyimides. Samples with high erosion yields were located next to  the silicone samples, as they were less likely to be affected by silicone cross-contamination.  Figure 32, GRC\u2019s 41 MISSE PEACE Polymers Loaded into Sample Tray E5, shows a pre-flight  photo of the PEACE Polymers samples, along with the five other samples, with each sample\u2019s  identification overlaid. The five samples on the top row at the left were not part of the MISSE  PEACE Polymers experiment and, therefore, do not have an overlaid identification.

Estimated environmental conditions of solar exposure,  tray temperatures, and ionizing radiation doses on MISSEs 1 and 2 are described in detail by  Pippin (2006). For the ram-facing side of MISSE PEC 2 (exposed to atomic oxygen and solar  radiation), the total equivalent sun hours (ESH) was estimated to be 5,000 to 6,700 ESH. This  total includes Earth-reflected illumination (650 to 820 ESH). The spectrum of Earth reflection  solar radiation has a reduced contribution from the VUV portion of the spectrum because of  absorption by Earth\u2019s atmosphere (Pippin, 2006). Tray E5 was computed to have received  approximately 6,300 ESH. The 3.95-year exposure in LEO resulted in approximately 22,800  thermal cycles; Pippin reports the baseplate thermal cycling temperature range for MISSE 2 to be  nominally between 40 and -30 \u00b0C, with occasional short-term excursions to more extreme  temperatures.  MISSE 2. Data from thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) with thin shielding layers are most  relevant to estimates of doses for the PEACE Polymer experiment thin polymer films.

Black-light inspection of the trays showed minimal to no contamination visible on  the MISSE surfaces (Pippin, 2006), and results of XPS contamination analyses of two MISSE 2  sapphire witness samples in sample Tray E6 (located next to Tray E5) indicated an extremely  thin silica contaminant layer (1.3 and 1.4 nm on each slide, respectively) (Dever et al., 2006). A  small amount of fluorine was also detected (Dever et al., 2006).

Therefore, the flight erosion yield data were  measurably affected by contamination, which further increases the importance of these long-  duration flight data.    igure 33, PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray in the NASA LaRC Clean Room during Post-  Flight Retrieval Examination, is a post-retrieval photograph of the experiment tray as observed  directly after PEC 2 was opened for the first time at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). As  expected, many of the polymer samples were significantly degraded. Figure 34, Post-Flight  Photograph of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray, shows the experiment (Tray E5)  after de-integration from MISSE PEC 2.  Figure 33\u2014PEACE Polymers Experiment Tray in the NASA LaRC Clean Room during  Post-Flight Retrieval Examination                    Planning for a 3-year exposure (rather than for the anticipated 1-year exposure) was found to be  crucial to this experiment\u2019s success: even though the experiment received nearly 4 years of  atomic oxygen exposure, material was left for all samples except one (PBI, 2-E5-35).  nce Tray E5 was brought back to NASA GRC, post-flight photo-documentation of the samples  was conducted. Photographs were taken of the individual samples before removal of the try, after  removal from the tray (left in a flight stack next to the control stack), and with the individual  sample layers separated. Details on the number of layers for each sample that were eroded  completely, the number that were textured by erosion, and the number remaining non-eroded  were recorded. For samples for which additional stacked layers (Part B) had been placed behind  the weighed layers (Part A), Parts A and B were separated for weighing. For some samples,  however, the individual layers could not be separated from each other without damaging the  sample texture or losing gossamer pieces of residual material; in these cases, all layers were kept  together for post-flight sample weighing. The post-flight weighing procedures replicated the pre-  flight weighing procedures in terms of the vacuum dehydration process (dehydration time,  sample order, and weighing technique) as closely as possible, with the only exception occurring  when Parts A and B could not be separated because of the extent of the erosion, which could  cause intermingling and/or loss of sample mass during weighing.  s previously mentioned, each flight sample included two sets of sample layers: Part A was  enough material to last for 1.5 years in space, theoretically, and the additional layers of Part B  extended the time to approximately 3 years. Each flight sample also had a corresponding  identical backup sample (including both Parts A and B) that was kept on the ground as a control  sample. Though flight sample Parts A and B were not separated during flight, they were  separated for pre- and post-flight weighing. This is because, with mission time constraints, only  Part A of each sample was weighed pre-flight; therefore, a theoretical value for the pre-flight  mass of Part B was calculated. The pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A (MF) and the pre-  flight mass of control sample Part A (MC) were used to calculate the average mass per layer  (MA), which was multiplied by the number (n) of layers in flight sample Part B to get Part B\u2019s  theoretical pre-flight mass (n\u00b7MA).  here were three different situations (Situations 1 through 3) for post-flight sample weighing;  therefore, three different equations to determine mass loss were required. Details of the mass loss  equations are provided in Appendix B of this NASA Technical Handbook, along with the error  analysis equations.  n Situation 1 (Figure 35, Illustration of Situation 1 Sample Erosion), either only one sample  layer was flown or the atomic oxygen eroded through only some of the layers in flight sample  Part A and all layers of flight sample Part B were still pristine (non-eroded). Because flight  sample Part A and flight sample Part B were weighed separately pre-flight, in this situation, only  Part A needed to be weighed post-flight and compared with its pre-flight mass. This was the  ideal situation, because it minimized error by omitting the variable of the mass of Part B.            Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B    pilex-S\uf0d2 (biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPDA) and diamine) (PI, 2-E5-32) is an  example of a Situation 1 sample. Figure 36, Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2) (11  Layers, each 0.0025 cm thick), shows the stacked flight sample next to the stacked control  sample. Eleven layers was stacked together and flown; Part A was comprised of 6 layers, and  Part B was comprised of 5 layers. The individual layers of the flight sample are shown in Figure  37, Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2) with Layers Separated (11 Layers, each 0.025 cm  thick), alongside the layers of the control sample. During flight, only the top four layers of Part A  experienced erosion: the top two layers were completely eroded, leaving the ring under the lip of  Tray E5. The third layer was eroded with holes at the atomic oxygen textured cone valleys, and  the fourth layer was eroded in places corresponding to the cone valley holes in the third layer.  Because only Part A of this flight sample experienced erosion, Part A was separated from Part B  post-flight, and only Part A was weighed and compared to the pre-flight mass of Part A to  calculate its flight experiment mass loss.       Pre-Flight  (pristine)   Partially  eroded  through                   Figure 37\u2014Post-Flight Photograph of PI (Upilex-S\u00ae) with Layers Separated (11 Layers,  each 0.025 cm thick)  Pyrolytic graphite (PG, 2-E5-25), shown in Figure 38, Post-Flight Photograph of Pyrolytic  Graphite (1 Layer, 2,032 \uf06dm thick), is another example of a Situation 1 sample. A single thick  layer (0.203 cm) was flown; Part A was one layer, and there was no Part B. The post-flight  sample is shown next to the control sample in Figure 38. The resulting atomic oxygen erosion  texture produced a velvety-looking matte black surface in the area of exposure.                        n Situation 2 (Figure 39, Illustration of Situation 2 Sample Erosion), atomic oxygen erosion  occurred through all the layers of flight sample Part A and through some of flight sample Part B.  In this situation, flight sample Parts A and B were able to be separated to be weighed post-flight.  Because flight sample Part B was not weighed pre-flight, its theoretical pre-flight mass was used.

As shown in Figure 40, Post-Flight Photograph of Kapton\uf0d2 H with Layers Separated (3  Layers, each 0.0127 cm thick), three 0.0127-cm-thick layers were flown. Part A consisted of two  layers, and Part B consisted of one layer. During flight, atomic oxygen eroded the top layer  completely and eroded partially through the second layer, leaving a gossamer-thin cone-like  textured film. Holes in the valleys of the cones of the second layer allowed the third layer to be  exposed to and textured by atomic oxygen. In this case, therefore, pre-flight and post-flight mass  measurements were needed for both Parts A and B.

Because of this, flight sample Parts  A and B were weighed together post-flight.     Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B     Pre-Flight  (pristine)   Partially  eroded  through                     Atomic oxygen fluence witness sample Kapton\uf0d2 H (PI, 2-E5-33) is an example of a Situation 3  sample (Figure 42, Post-Flight Photograph of Kapton\uf0d2 H (3 Layers, each 0.0127 cm thick)).  Three 0.0127-cm-thick layers were flown; Part A consisted of two layers, and Part B consisted of  one layer. During flight, atomic oxygen eroded the top layer completely and eroded the second  layer to a cone-like texture. Holes in the valleys of the cones in the second layer allowed the  third layer to be exposed to and textured by atomic oxygen. For this sample, it was not possible  to separate the second layer from the third layer without causing damage; therefore, the post-  flight mass measurements were taken with Part A and B together.     he atomic oxygen fluence for PEC 2 Tray 1 E5 was computed based on the mass loss of two  Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples (2-E5-30 and 2-E5-33). Each Kapton\uf0d2 H witness sample consisted  of three 0.0127-cm-thick layers for a total thickness of 0.0381 cm. As stated previously,  Kapton\uf0d2 H is commonly used for fluence calibration because it has a well-characterized erosion  yield in LEO (3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom).   Two techniques for mass loss determination were evaluated: averaging the first three mass  readings and back-extrapolation of the mass data to time zero using linear curve fits to get  theoretically dehydrated mass values. The results of these measurements are provided in  Table 6, Atomic Oxygen Fluence for Kapton\uf0d2 H Calibration Samples.

The average  atomic oxygen fluences for the two different techniques were also very similar. Therefore, it was                 decided to use the average mass value instead of the linear back-extrapolation value for  determining the atomic oxygen fluence for the experiment and also for obtaining the pre- and  post-flight mass values necessary to determine the erosion yields for the individual PEACE  Polymer samples. The average atomic oxygen fluence for the PEACE Polymers experiment  exposure (Tray E5) on MISSE 2 was determined to be 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2 (de Groh et al.,  2006, ESA; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2008).    able 7, MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers Erosion Yield Data, provides the erosion yield data for the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, along with mass loss, density, and exposure area data.  After the 4-year mission, 6 of the 41 samples had experienced full-thickness erosion of part of  the sample area (such as one edge) or of the entire sample area. These samples are listed in Table  8, MISSE 2 Samples Partially or Fully Eroded through All Layers, along with a summary of  extent of erosion. Therefore, the erosion yield for each of these samples is actually greater than  the value provided, as indicated in Table 7. These six materials were flown again for erosion  yield determination as part of the MISSE 6A Stressed Polymers Experiment, which experienced  1.45 years of space exposure.

To address this,  the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental erosion yield value was calculated using equations for  fractional uncertainty derived from the equation used to find erosion yield (McCarthy et al.,  2010). The standard deviation or error of each measurement that was used to calculate the  erosion yield was incorporated into the resulting fractional uncertainty of the erosion yield for  each of three different error situations, which correspond to the three post-flight weighing  procedures. The resulting error calculations showed the erosion yield values to be very accurate,  with an average error of \uf0b13.30 percent (McCarthy et al., 2010). Table 9, MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers Erosion Yield Uncertainty Data, provides the fractional uncertainty in erosion yield for  each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (McCarthy et al., 2010).

Because the mission was 3.95 years in duration, many of the polymers  were eroded through several layers, several of the polymers were eroded through all layers in at  least a portion of the exposed area, and one sample was completely eroded. It was determined,  therefore, that the best way to measure the optical and thermal properties of the flight samples  was to determine which layers should be measured and then compare the same number of layers  from the control flight samples. If a sample was partially eroded, the layer or layers that  experienced partial erosion (rather than full erosion, as with the layers above the partially eroded  layers) and the intact layer immediately underneath were analyzed, and the control sample  included the same number of layers, as shown in Figure 43, Schematic Diagram of MISSE 2  Flight Sample Layer Erosion and the Corresponding Layers used for Optical and Thermal  Property Measurements. If the top layers could be damaged by pulling the layers apart, the  samples were left as a whole, and an equal number of control sample layers were used for  analysis.

For most samples, SR and DR properties changed significantly as a  result of directed LEO atomic oxygen exposure. Generally, there was a decrease in SR with an  increase in DR. These optical property changes are relevant to glare issues, Fresnel lens  photovoltaic concentrator power loss issues, and issues with spatial variations in the thermal load  on a spacecraft.     include the widest variety of well-characterized polymers collectively exposed to the LEO  atomic oxygen space environment for a long duration. The erosion yield values of the MISSE 2  PEACE Polymers were based on mass loss, using dehydrated pre-flight and post-flight mass  measurements. Erosion yield values for numerous prior flight experiments based on mass loss  were not obtained using dehydrated mass values, which introduces large error for either low-  fluence missions (such as Shuttle flight experiments) or low erosion yield samples exposed to  high-fluence missions. The MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment was an extremely clean  experiment, receiving only ~1.3 nm of silica contamination (NASA/TM\u20142006-214482, MISSE  PEACE Polymers Atomic Oxygen Erosion Results). Therefore, the erosion yield data were not  measurably affected by on-orbit contamination. Other long-duration flight experiments, such as  the LDEF, have experienced significant concentrations of silicone/silica contamination; such  contamination adversely affects erosion yield data.   applications, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, Mylar\uf0d2, and Kapton\uf0d2, to more recently developed polymers,  such as high-temperature polyimide PMR. Additional polymers typically not desired for  spacecraft applications were also included to explore erosion yield dependence upon chemical  composition for the purpose of the development of a predictive model. Extensive error analyses  have been conducted of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples, documenting the uncertainty in  the erosion yield values.                  paceflight experiments are unique, expensive, and time-consuming, which is why atomic  oxygen ground laboratory testing, such as in an RF plasma asher, is often used for spacecraft  material durability prediction. However, the correlation between in-space degradation and  ground-testing degradation needs to be determined, because ground facilities and the space  environment differ in many ways. These differences include variations in species, energies,  thermal exposures, and radiation exposures, all of which may result in different reactions and  erosion rates. For example, the direction of atomic oxygen arrival can differ between ground  facilities and the space environment. Materials exposed to the LEO environment often receive  either directed or sweeping ram atomic oxygen, whereas in a plasma asher, the atomic oxygen  arrival is isotropic. Additionally, the atomic oxygen energy of a plasma asher is much lower  (\uf0bb0.04 eV) than the atomic oxygen energy in LEO (\uf0bb4.5 eV). Furthermore, samples in a plasma  asher receive an intense amount of UV radiation, whereas samples in LEO receive many  different types of radiation, including broad spectrum UV radiation, electron and proton  radiation, and solar flare x-rays. The plasma in ashers, operating on air as a feed gas, includes  diatomic nitrogen, diatomic oxygen and oxygen ions, along with monatomic nitrogen and  monatomic oxygen in both excited and ground-energy states. However, ground-state atomic  oxygen is the predominant species of the LEO environment (NASA-TM-X-74335). All of these  exposure differences may affect the rate of degradation of materials. As a consequence, the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of a polymer measured in an RF plasma asher can be significantly  different than that measured in LEO. Studies have been conducted to try to understand the effects  of various factors in ground test facilities on the erosion yields of certain polymers. For example,  Miller et al. (2008) conducted a series of experiments to isolate UV radiation and charged  species during atomic oxygen exposure of PE, Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, and Kapton\uf0d2 HN, relative to  Kapton\uf0d2 H in a plasma asher (Miller et al., 2008). The same materials were also exposed to a  hyperthermal atomic oxygen beam (Miller et al., 2008). The results were found to vary with the  polymer and indicated that UV radiation, charged particle exposure, and beam energy affected  the erosion yields of FEP and PE but not of Kapton\uf0d2 HN, relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H.  n an effort to improve the accuracy of ground-based durability testing, ground-laboratory to in-  space atomic oxygen correlation experiments have been conducted. In these tests, the atomic  oxygen erosion yields of the PEACE Polymers were determined relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H, using an  RF plasma asher (operated on air). The asher erosion yields were compared to the MISSE 2  PEACE Polymers LEO erosion yields to determine the correlation between erosion rates in the  two environments (Stambler et al., 2009).  10. CORRELATION OF GROUND-LABORATORY DATA TO IN-  SPACE DATA   of film where possible) as the polymers used in the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers flight  experiment; therefore, they were a second set of control samples. Although stacked layers of  polymer films were flown in the MISSE 2 flight experiment, only single-layer film samples were  exposed in the plasma asher.            samples were vacuum-dehydrated for at least 48 hours before their masses were measured both  before and after atomic oxygen plasma exposure, as recommended by ASTM E 2089-00  (Stambler et al., 2009). The samples\u2019 dehydrated masses were obtained using a Mettler Balance  with a sensitivity of \u00b10.000001 g.     amples were exposed to an atomic oxygen environment in a Structure Probe, Inc., Plasma  Prep II asher. This asher generates a plasma by exciting ambient air with 100 W of continuous  RF power at 13.56 MHz (Gulino, 1986). The operating pressure was 6.67 to 13.33 Pa. The  plasma is composed of oxygen and nitrogen ions and atoms (Rutledge et al., 1994); the nitrogen  species have been found to have a negligible effect in the erosion processes (Rutledge et al.,  1986). The Kapton\uf0d2 H effective atomic oxygen fluence was calculated based on mass loss data  of dehydrated 127-\u03bcm (5-mil) Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide samples, which were ashed with the test  samples. Kapton\uf0d2 H is used as a standard material to measure effective fluence because the  erosion yield in LEO is well characterized. The atomic oxygen erosion yield for Kapton\uf0d2 H was  assumed to be 3.00\uf0b410-24 cm3/atom based on these data (ASTM E 2089-00).  ix samples were ashed together using a specially designed holder with six sample openings  (Figure 45, Sample Holder with Six Polymer Samples). The holder protected the edges and the  backs of the samples from the plasma, which kept the samples from curling during exposure and  provided a well-defined exposure area. The holder was always placed in the same position in the  asher in an effort to provide the same flux for each sample position. The sample positions are  indicated in Figure 45. A Kapton\uf0d2 H fluence witness sample was placed in position 1 for every  test so that the atomic oxygen effective fluence could be determined.                      positions relative to position 1. For these tests, Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples were in all six  positions. The effective flux was then determined for each position (based on dehydrated mass  loss). During the plasma asher exposures, to calculate the fluence to which each sample was  exposed during a test, the effective fluence was determined for the Kapton\uf0d2 H witness in  position 1, and then that fluence was multiplied by the factor for each position to get the fluence  for each sample position.  amples were exposed to Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluences ranging from 7.7\uf0b41019 to  2.2\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2\uf0d7sec. Details on the test procedures, including atomic oxygen flux tests,  exposure area measurements and results, and individual sample text exposures, are provided by  Stambler et al. (2009).    of the PEACE Polymers in space, as determined during the MISSE 2 flight experiment, and in  the asher based on the Kapton\uf0d2 H effective erosion yield. The Table also provides the asher to  in-space erosion yield ratios. All of the polymers had higher asher erosion yields than in-space  erosion yields. This is related to the many differences that exist between in-space and asher  exposure, as mentioned earlier.  ost of the ratios of asher-to-in-space erosion yield were between 1 and 3. According to this  table, it appears that PI (PMR-15) had an asher-to-in-space ratio of <1.0, but the asher erosion  yield (3.1\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom) was slightly higher than the in-space erosion yield  (\uf03e3.02\uf0b410-24 cm3/atom). Some of the fluoropolymers, such as amorphous fluoropolymer (AF),  PTFE, perfluoroalkoxy copolymer resin (PFA), and FEP, had significantly higher asher-to-in-  space ratios.  evlar\uf0d2 and white Tedlar\uf0d2 stand out as having ratios of 24.0 and 37.1, respectively, the highest  of all the samples. The high asher to in-space ratio for the Kevlar\uf0d2 sample is likely because of its  morphology: Kevlar\uf0d2 is a woven fabric, and atomic oxygen can attack a greater surface area per  atomic oxygen fluence in the asher than in LEO. The high asher to in-space ratio for the white  Tedlar\uf0d2 sample is likely a result of its white titanium dioxide pigment, which is atomic oxygen  durable. When the polymeric content of white Tedlar\uf0d2 erodes during atomic oxygen exposure, it  leaves a fine nonvolatile powder on the sample surface. This can shield the underlying polymer  from atomic oxygen attack. For the MISSE flight experiment, the atomic oxygen arrival was  primarily from the ram direction (normal to the polymer surface), and so the residual powder  appears to have formed a protective layer (if not disturbed). In the asher, however, where atomic  oxygen arrival is isotropic and at thermal energy (\uf0bb0.04 eV), the high atomic oxygen flux can get  underneath the protective particles and cause significantly greater erosion than in space. In  addition, the effective fluences for the asher tests were well below the in-space fluence of  8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2, which means that there was probably a higher density of atomic-oxygen-  durable pigment particles during the later phases of the in-space exposure. Therefore, the erosion  of white Tedlar\uf0d2 is substantially greater in the plasma asher than it is in space.

It is possible that the  atomic oxygen erosion yield of these polymers may decrease over time because more atomic-  oxygen-durable particles are exposed on the sample surface with increasing fluence, providing  increasingly greater protection of the underlying material. Therefore, it would be beneficial to  obtain atomic oxygen erosion yields of polymers in LEO from several missions of different               durations so that samples are exposed to several different LEO atomic oxygen fluences. In this  way, erosion yield dependence on fluence could be assessed for different polymers.    apparent that not all materials that form volatile oxidation products have the same erosion yield.  For example, hydrocarbon polymers that have a high fractional oxygen content, such as  polyoxymethylene (POM), tend to have higher erosion yields than those that have low fractional  oxygen content. Polymers that have high fractional fluorine content, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP and  PTFE, tend to have lower atomic oxygen erosion yields than those composed of hydrogen rather  than fluorine, such as PE. Although it is not clear the degree to which the type and number of  chemical bonds influence the probability of an atomic oxygen atom reacting, it is reasonable to  assume that there is some dependence of type and number of chemical bonds on atomic oxygen  erosion yield.    have a lower atomic oxygen erosion yield than a less dense material, such as polystyrene foam,  because it takes more oxygen atoms per square centimeter to oxidize a more dense material.  Polymers that contain high fractions of non-oxidizable content, such as ash or metal oxide  pigment particles, as does white Tedlar\uf0d2 polyvinyl fluoride, should have lower erosion yields  than polymers that have low ash contents, because the non-oxidizable particles can shield the  polymer from reacting with the oxygen atoms. Similarly, as an ash-containing polymer erodes  with time, an increasing proportion of the polymer surface becomes covered with ash, which  causes the erosion yield to drop with fluence. Thus, atomic oxygen fluence should be considered  a variable rather than a constant, because almost all polymers contain a small amount of non-  oxidizable ash.   atomic oxygen erosion yield data (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh  et al., 2006, ESA), polymer chemical structure information concerning the number and types of  chemical bonds, polymer density information, fractional ash content data, and atomic oxygen  fluence data (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2006, ESA;  Banks et al., 2008). Although other environmental factors in addition to atomic oxygen, such as  VUV radiation, ionizing radiation, and sample temperature, may have effects on the erosion  yield of materials, they were not included in this model because they were not variable in the  MISSE 2 experiment. The atomic oxygen predictive tool equation coefficients were sequentially  and iteratively adjusted to achieve the highest correlation coefficient between actual LEO results  and those of the predictive tool. Therefore, the physical properties and chemical structures  discussed above were used to develop a formula that provided the closest match between  predicted and actual erosion yields. The LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield data from MISSE 2  can be found in section 9.3.5 in this NASA Technical Handbook.          t is clear from the atomic oxygen erosion yield data from the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment, as well as from previous LEO flight experiments, that polymers with a significant  abundance of pendant fluorine and/or chlorine atoms, such as FEP and CTFE, had low atomic  oxygen erosion yields relative to Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide in LEO. Conversely, polymers with  significant oxygen content in their backbone, such as POM, had much higher atomic oxygen  erosion yields. It is far less clear to what degree erosion yield depends on mixes of in-chain or  pendant oxygen, nitrogen, and benzyl rings or whether the bonding is single, double, or triple.  Therefore, many approaches were explored to correlate erosion yield with chemical structure, the  number of atoms of each type in a polymer repeat unit, and the number of bonds of each type  (single, double, or triple) in the polymer repeat unit.   ost polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material that does not become volatile upon  reaction with atomic oxygen. The residue that results after atomic oxygen exposure is called ash.  The presence of fragile remaining ash may account for some of the debris shown on some  samples in the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment post-flight photo in Figure 34. As atomic  oxygen erodes a polymer that contains inorganic material in LEO, the resulting nonvolatile ash  begins to accumulate on the eroded surface of the polymer, shielding the underlying polymer  from oxidation. As a result, a polymer\u2019s ash content can reduce its erosion yield. For example, as  previously stated, the titanium dioxide pigment particles in white polyvinyl fluoride (PVF-W,  white Tedlar\uf0d2) shield its surface, resulting in a very low erosion yield of 0.101\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom,  compared to the much higher erosion yield of 3.19\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom of clear Tedlar\uf0d2. The  protection of oxidized polymers is more dependent upon the volume fraction of ash than on the  mass fraction of ash because the surface coverage of ash plays a dominant role. However, it is  much easier to use the mass fraction of ash because it is very difficult to measure ash volume  unless you know the ash density.  determined experimentally for each of the 39 PEACE Polymers and pyrolytic graphite. Ash  content was defined as the fraction of the initial dehydrated polymer mass that was nonvolatile  and that remained after the polymer had been completely oxidized in an RF plasma asher. This  was accomplished by placing pieces of each polymer in thin Al foil cups and ashing them for  several hundred hours in an RF plasma asher operated on air until only ash remained (Banks et  al., 2009). The Al cups had been previously exposed to atomic oxygen to remove organic  coatings that typically reside on Al foil as a result of foil processing. Figure 46, SEM Images of  the Ash Remaining after Several Hundred Hours of RF Plasma Asher Air Plasma Exposure,  shows the ash remaining from white Tedlar\uf0d2 and PEO. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy revealed  the presence of titanium in the white Tedlar\uf0d2 ash, as expected because of the titanium dioxide  pigment particles, and the presence of a mix of metal elements in the ash from PEO.   densely packed atoms should have lower erosion yields than loosely packed atoms. Data on  polymer density were obtained from either the suppliers or density gradient column testing  (de Groh et al., 2008; de Groh et al., 2006, NSMMS; de Groh et al., 2006, ESA).             Figure 46\u2014SEM Images of the Ash Remaining after Several Hundred Hours of RF Plasma  Asher Air Plasma Exposure  Unfortunately, a gradual buildup of inorganic contamination from the asher itself complicates the  process of determining ash content because the added mass from contaminants is observed as  additional ash. This buildup is especially prevalent if the ashing is continued long after the  organic portion of the polymer is completely oxidized. Additionally, materials with low erosion  yields tend to accumulate more contamination in the asher environment than those with high  erosion yields. Correcting for this contamination is problematic because it depends on the surface  area of the ash, which is difficult to measure.  he effect of ash content on erosion yield in an end Hall hyperthermal atomic oxygen facility  (Banks et al., 2006) was determined by measuring the erosion yield of five epoxy resin samples  that were purposely filled with various amounts of fumed silica. Epoxy resin with no added  fumed silica was found to also contain some ash, as indicated in Table 11, Ash Content of the  Five Samples used to Measure Erosion Yield Dependence on Mass Fraction Ash, as a result of  ashing samples of the cured epoxy. Additional ash, in the form of fumed silica, was weighed and  mixed with both parts of the uncured epoxy to achieve the total mass fraction ash (fraction of ash  in the polymer determined by the mass) indicated in Table 11, which was used to plot Figure 47,  Erosion Yield Dependence on Mass Fraction Ash in Epoxy for a Kapton\uf0d2 H Effective Fluence of  1.24\uf0b41020 atoms/cm2.

It was necessary to use  hyperthermal rather than thermal energy atomic oxygen attack because thermal energy atomic  oxygen is not greatly attenuated (compared to LEO hyperthermal atomic oxygen) in reaction  probability as a result of arrival on ash surfaces. Because particle-filled epoxy resins tend to have  a resin-rich surface, all the samples were abraded before atomic oxygen exposure to ensure that  the exposed surfaces were representative of the bulk material.    atoms/cm2 is shown in Figure 47.

This observed erosion yield dependence on ash content was also quantifiably  consistent with end Hall atomic oxygen exposure of clear and white Tedlar\uf0d2, suggesting that the  equation is probably reasonably accurate for all ash-containing polymers.

An approximation of this ash-shielding dependence on fluence was determined by  modeling the erosion yield of white Tedlar\uf0d2 in hyperthermal atomic oxygen environments for the  low-fluence end Hall test and the high-fluence MISSE 2 LEO exposure, as shown in  Figure 49, Erosion Yield Ash Attenuation Constant (K) as a Function of Fluence (F). In this  Figure, the erosion yield for the end Hall test was corrected to account for the differences           between the Kapton\uf0d2 H effective fluence of the end Hall exposure and in-space exposure using  the ratio between Kapton\uf0d2 H and white Tedlar\uf0d2 erosion yields for both environments.       with a power law dependence, which implies that, if the fluence doubles, the attenuation constant  is slightly less than doubled. This is reasonable, because the buildup of ash on the surface of a  polymer, which causes the attenuation, occurs faster at low fluences.  dditional erosion yield dependencies were considered for the predictive model, including  physical density (\uf072 (g/cm3)). Also considered was the packing density of atoms (V\uf053\uf02fVr), which  relates to how densely the atoms could theoretically be packed in comparison to the actual  volume of the repeat unit, where larger spaces would occur between atoms because of van der  Waals bonding or void spaces. The minimum volume of the atoms that make up a polymer  repeat unit (V\uf053) was based on the sum of the atoms making up the polymer repeat unit, assuming  each atom\u2019s volume to be determined by its covalent radii.  he actual volume of each repeat unit (Vr) was determined based on the chemical structure of the  repeat unit as well as the molecular weight and density of the material. Thus, for a ratio of V\uf053\uf02fVr  of much less than 1, the polymer\u2019s erosion yield would be higher than that of a similarly  structured polymer with tightly packed atoms. Values of V\uf053\uf02fVr are given in Banks et al., (2008).                              ver 100 different equations were tested using the information in the previous section to  determine a formula that had a high correlation coefficient (R2) with the actual LEO erosion  yield data. An initial erosion yield model (Banks et al., 2008) produced a correlation coefficient  of 0.914. That model used an assumption of linear dependency and made extensive use of  information about the bonding of atoms in a repeat unit (Banks et al., 2008). However, the  equation for that model produced negative erosion yields for some polymers that were not flown  as part of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment.  11.3 Single Organic Material Atomic Oxygen Erosion Yield Predictive Model (2009  Version)  o correct this problem, an alternative approach (the September 2009 version) was pursued; this  version used the dependency variables (such as atomic populations per repeat unit) as exponents  with appropriate constants to optimize the correlation coefficient. This concept used weighted  exponents rather than weighted additive terms. It allowed for dependency on the numbers and  types of chemical bonds, polymer density information, and fractional ash content data and  atomic oxygen fluence, while preventing negative erosion yield values. It enabled significant  simplification of the predictive equation with very little loss in the correlation coefficient from  the September 2009 version (Banks et al., 2009; Banks et al., 2011).   2 PEACE Polymers data. The resulting equation used atomic populations in the repeat unit as  well as physical density, packing density, ash content, and the number of single and double  oxygen bonds in the repeat unit.

The flight  experiment materials were selected specifically to represent a variety of polymers used in space  and a wide variety of chemical structures. The September 2009 predictive tool utilizes the  chemical structure, atomic populations of the polymer repeat unit, oxygen bonding information,  and physical properties, such as density and ash content, that can be measured in ground  laboratory tests. The prediction does not require the use of asher erosion yield information. The  tool has a correlation coefficient of 0.895 and an uncertainty of \uf0b11.27\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom when  compared with actual MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers space data (for 38 polymers and pyrolytic  graphite). One polymer, PEO, was found to be significantly off the linear fit and so was not used  in the predictive tool equation. The predictive tool does appear to predict reasonable atomic  oxygen erosion yields, even for those polymers for which the previous predictive process yielded  negative erosion yield values. The tool also allows for the prediction of atomic oxygen erosion  yields as a function of fluence, which is relevant for polymers with high fractional ash contents.  The purpose of the predictive tool is to enable estimations of LEO atomic oxygen erosion yields  for new polymers and composites without expensive and time-consuming in-space testing.      owever, because the erosion yield may be fluence dependent if the polymer contains ash or a  non-oxidizable pigment, the thickness of the material that is eroded is not simply proportional to  the fluence. The erosion yield must be calculated for the specific fluence being considered. This  can be accomplished if the following are known: the fluence, the ash content of the material, and  the dependence on erosion yield of the ash content of the polymer as discussed in section 11 of  this NASA Technical Handbook. Polymers with high fractional ash content typically show  greater erosion yield dependence than polymers with low ash content.  ome polymers, such as Teflon\uf0d2 FEP, have been found to exhibit an erosion yield dependence  on ESH (de Groh, K. K. and Banks, B.A., Atomic Oxygen Erosion Data From the MISSE 2-8  Missions, NASA TM-2019-219982, May 2019), as shown in Figure 51, Erosion Yield versus  Solar Exposure (ESH) for TeflonTM FEP Flown on Various Missions. This may be related to  Once the atomic oxygen erosion yield for a polymer has been determined by experiment or  predictive modeling, the expected thickness loss (X) is given by:                  greater volatility of oxidized polymer scission fragments on the surface, the number of which  gradually increases with VUV exposure.

However, at angles near and beyond 90\uf0b0 from the ram direction, the flux  of atomic oxygen is higher than that predicted by cosine losses. That is because the fluence  beyond 90\uf0b0 is related to the velocity vector contributions caused by the Maxwell Boltzman  distribution of the atomic oxygen velocities, spacecraft orbital inclination, and the co-rotation of  the thermosphere. If a spacecraft is spinning with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the orbital  plane, then the average flux to any surface that is perpendicular to that plane is simply 1/\uf070 of that  of the ram direction. If the spacecraft is rotating in random directions, then the average flux is  1/4 that of the ram flux.

Therefore, the  polysiloxane and/or fiberglass-containing composite is evaluated for ash content just as any other  polymer would be. However, the ash content for this material is substantially larger than for a  pure (neat) hydro- or halocarbon polymer. As a consequence, the erosion yield is lower than for a  neat polymer, matrix, carbon-fiber composite. In addition, the erosion yield of this material  decreases with fluence as the surface becomes more and more protected by the oxides that  remain on the surface after erosion of the hydrocarbon components of the composite. Ash  content, in terms of fractional mass ash, can be most effectively determined by taking weight  loss measurements of filings of composite samples and ashing them in an RF plasma asher. This  provides a representative sampling of the fiber and matrix components of the composite. The  resulting fractional mass ash is then substituted into the predictive erosion yield equation.  the entire material volume because the carbon-fiber-fill fraction may vary throughout the  composite. For example, the surface of a carbon-fiber-filled organic matrix composite may have  a greater volume fraction of matrix material than deep within the bulk. Foam (open- or closed-  pore) materials also have a higher erosion yield than their denser versions. The erosion yield of  the polymer component of the foam material is simply the erosion yield of a fully dense polymer,     \uf072  \uf072   =  f =  the density of the fully dense polymer  the density of the foam polymer.         y  \uf072  f           but the erosion yield of the pores component is infinity, because it does not take any oxygen  atoms to erode through a pore. Therefore, using the rule of mixtures based on the erosion yields  of each material erroneously predicts an infinite erosion yield of the mixed material.  owever, the rule of mixtures based on the erosion resistance and volume fraction of each  material predicts a correct erosion yield for the mixture. The erosion resistance is simply the  inverse of the erosion yield, a concept similar to the addition of electrical resistors in parallel to  obtain the overall resistance. Therefore, the erosion resistance of the mixed materials (ER) is as  follows:      Ey = atomic oxygen erosion yield of the mixed material (cm3/atom)  Ff = fractional volume of fibers in the composite  Fp = fractional volume of polymer in the composite  ERf = atomic oxygen erosion resistance of fibers (atoms/cm3)  ERp = atomic oxygen erosion resistance of polymer matrix (atoms/cm3).   he ash content of a carbon-fiber-based hydrocarbon matrix composite can be evaluated by  ashing samples (typically filings) of the material. This allows the matrix polymer and fiber  components of the composite to contribute in proper proportions to the measured ash content. If  the polymer matrix material is a co-polymer that contains polysiloxanes, then the erosion yield  for that polymer, which takes into account its ash content, should be used in the above formula.   oxygen to propagate through their thickness, thus allowing for potential interaction with  underlying materials. Data comparing the fractional flux being transmitted, i.e., fractional open  area, for individual materials are currently not available, but the fractional flux would be  dependent on the details of the fabric geometry, thickness, and atomic oxygen arrival impact   Eyf = erosion yield of the fibers in the composite  Eyp = erosion yield of the polymer in the composite.        1  E    EF  \uf0d7  f    EF  \uf0d7  p                         angle. In addition, atomic oxygen that did pass through the fabric would be trapped and produce  an erosion yield beyond what would be based on the fractional open area of the fabric.    for thermal-control surfaces such as multilayer insulation blanket layers, and for lightweight  structural components. The atomic oxygen durability of such components is critical to mission  reliability and performance, and knowledge of the durability of typical spacecraft materials and  anticipated materials is crucial to spacecraft design considerations. To address this need, LEO  spaceflight experiment data were obtained, along with space environment data, ground-  laboratory analyses, and predictive modeling to provide atomic oxygen erosion yield predictions  for current and future spacecraft polymers.   the LEO space environment on the exterior of the ISS for 3.95 years as part of MISSE 2. The  objective of this experiment was to accurately determine the atomic oxygen erosion yields of a  wide variety of polymeric materials after long-term exposure to the space environment. The  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment (flown on MISSE 2, Tray 1, sample Tray E5) was exposed  to ram atomic oxygen, along with solar and charged-particle radiation. Mass loss was determined  to be the best technique for characterizing the atomic oxygen erosion yield values for this  experiment because, for some samples, erosion occurred through several layers at once, resulting in  a cone\u2013and-valley formation; for others, some sample layers were left as fragile gossamer films.  experiment based on mass loss measurements obtained from pre-flight and post-flight vacuum-  dehydrated samples. Exposure areas were determined based on post-flight measurements of each  individual flight sample\u2019s tray exposure opening. Density values for 36 of the 41 polymers were  obtained using calibrated density gradient columns; the densities of the other 5 samples were  obtained from referenced literature or manufacturers\u2019 MSDSs. The atomic oxygen fluence for  the experiment was calculated based on two Kapton\uf0d2 H witness samples. (No significant  difference in atomic oxygen fluence was found between the technique of back-extrapolation of  the mass data to time zero to get a theoretically dehydrated mass and the technique of using the  average mass values.) The average atomic oxygen fluence for the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment was determined to be 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2. As some samples may have experienced  a synergistic effect of solar exposure with atomic oxygen erosion, it is important to note that the  solar exposure for Tray E5 was computed to be approximately 6,300 ESH. There was partial or  complete full-thickness erosion of 6 of the 41 flight samples; therefore, because the mass loss  would likely have been greater had more material been flown, the erosion yield values for these  samples are greater than the values reported. Planning for a 3-year exposure (as opposed to the  anticipated 1 year) was found to be crucial to the success of this experiment because of the  unexpectedly long mission duration (3.95 years).   t is also important to know how accurate the atomic oxygen erosion yield data are. To address  this, the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental erosion yield value was calculated using equations  for fractional uncertainty derived from the equations used to compute erosion yield. Because         three different post-flight sample-weighing procedures were used, three different equations were  derived for determining the fractional uncertainty of the erosion yield values. The uncertainty  and fractional uncertainty in erosion yield for each of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples  have been determined; the average fractional standard deviation uncertainties in erosion yield  were very small: \u00b13.30 percent.   well-characterized polymers flown in LEO for a long duration under identical conditions. In  addition, this experiment was exposed to an environment with unusually little contamination.  Therefore, the atomic oxygen erosion yield data from this LEO flight experiment provide  extremely valuable information for spacecraft design and predictive model development  purposes.  n addition to documenting the LEO atomic oxygen erosion yield values of the MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers, this NASA Technical Handbook reviews background information on the LEO atomic  oxygen environment, atomic oxygen interaction with materials, ground-laboratory-to-in-space  correlation data for the PEACE Polymers in an RF plasma asher, an atomic oxygen erosion yield  predictive tool developed at NASA GRC based on the PEACE Polymers flight data, and tools for  using atomic oxygen erosion yield data for spacecraft durability predictions. In addition,  appendices in this NASA Technical Handbook review the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers atomic  oxygen erosion yield error analyses (Appendix B), review optical and thermal data for the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers (Appendix C), provide individual summary pages for each of the  MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (Appendix D), and provide an overview of lessons learned  from experiments investigating atomic oxygen interaction with spacecraft materials in LEO  (Appendix E).

This NASA Technical Handbook was supported by the ISS Research and MISSE-X  Projects and the NASA Technical Standards Program.           n any experiment, it is critical to determine the accuracy of the data obtained. To address this for  the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers experiment, the error in each polymer\u2019s experimental LEO  erosion yield value was calculated using equations for fractional uncertainty derived from the  equation used to find erosion yield (McCarthy et al., 2010). The specific equations developed  and resulting erosion yield uncertainties are provided in this appendix, which is based on the  error analysis conducted by McCarthy et al. (2010).           APPENDIX B: MISSE 2 PEACE POLYMERS EXPERIMENT  ATOMIC OXYGEN EROSION YIELD ERROR ANALYSIS    \u0394M = mass loss (g)  \u03c1  D = the exposed diameter of the polymer (cm)  F    well-established erosion yield in LEO: 3.0\uf0b410\u201324 cm3/atom (ASTM E 2089-00). The atomic  oxygen fluence for these samples can be calculated by solving Eq. B-1 for F and using the  Kapton\uf0d2 H mass loss and density values. The fluence was based on the frontal exposed area of  each sample. It is believed that the 45\u00b0-slanted edges of the Al sample holders contributed to a  slight increase in fluence around the perimeters of the samples, causing some samples to erode  through around the edge only; however, since this was the case for all of the samples, no further  calculations needed to be done to correct for this anomalous effect.     \uf044\uf0d7  \uf0d7  M  2  FD  \uf0d7                   ractional uncertainty, also called relative uncertainty or percent error, is a way of quantifying  error. In this investigation, the fractional uncertainty represents the fractional standard deviation  of the values and is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the value by the value itself.  The general equation for fractional uncertainty in atomic oxygen erosion yield is as follows:    s previously mentioned, each flight sample included two sets of sample layers: Part A was  enough material to theoretically last for 1.5 years in space, and the additional layers of Part B  extended the time to 3 years, as shown in Figure 52, Illustration of the Flight Sample Setup. Each  flight sample also had a corresponding identical backup sample, including both Parts A and B,  that was kept on the ground as a control. Though flight sample Parts A and B were not separated  during flight, they were separated for pre- and post-flight weighing. Because of mission time  constraints, Part B of each sample was not weighed pre-flight, and so a theoretical value for the  pre-flight mass of Part B was calculated: the pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A (MF) and the  pre-flight mass of control sample Part A (MC) were used to calculate the average mass per layer  (MA), which was multiplied by the number of layers (n) in flight sample Part B to get Part B\u2019s  theoretical pre-flight mass (n\u00b7MA).   E =  xi =  the atomic oxygen erosion yield  the ith variable in the equation for erosion yield.         \uf064\uf0d7  x    1  E   \uf0e5  i                  here were three different situations for post-flight sample weighing, so three different equations  to determine mass loss were required. Mass loss (\u0394M) is a factor in calculating the erosion yield  of a polymer (see Eq. B-1), and so it was also necessary to develop three different equations for  fractional uncertainty in erosion yield. The different mass loss equations were simply substituted  into the equation for erosion yield, and then, from each of the three resulting equations, an  equation for fractional uncertainty was derived to calculate the percent error for that situation.  In Situation 1, either only one sample layer was flown or the atomic oxygen eroded through only  some of the layers in flight sample Part A and all of flight sample Part B was still pristine (Figure  53, Illustration of Situation 1 Sample Erosion).  Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B  Partially  eroded  through     ecause flight sample Part A and flight sample Part B were weighed separately pre-flight, in this  situation only Part A needed to be weighed post-flight and compared with its pre-flight mass; so  to minimize error, the terms for pre- and post-flight mass for flight sample Part B were omitted  from the Situation 1 mass loss equation:      =   \u2212  \uf0a2  F  Flight Sample  Part A  (enough layers to  survive 1.5 yr)  Flight Sample  Part B  (enough  additional layers  to survive  a total of 3 yr)  Pre-Flight  (pristine)                  n Situation 2, atomic oxygen erosion occurred through all of the layers of flight sample Part  A and through some of the layers of flight sample Part B (Figure 54, Illustration of Situation 2  Sample Erosion).  Flight  Sample  Part A  Flight  Sample  Part B   In this situation, flight sample Parts A and B were able to be separated for post-flight  weighing. However, because flight sample Part B had not been weighed pre-flight, its  theoretical pre-flight mass was used. Therefore, the Situation 2 equation for mass loss is:    MF and  n\u00b7MA   =   =   =  the pre- and post-flight mass values, respectively, of flight sample Part A  the theoretical pre-flight mass of flight sample Part B  the post-flight mass of Part B.   MF =   =   the pre-flight mass of flight sample Part A  the post-flight mass of Part A.

This needed to be taken into  account as well. The equation for the average of the two fluence values is found through the  following:             loss, density, erosion yield, and exposed diameter values, along with the corresponding  uncertainty values, for the two Kapton\uf0d2 fluence witness samples.

However, for five other samples  (PE, ADC, PMMA, polyetherimide (PEI), and PMR-15), atomic oxygen did, in some places,  erode through all layers. For these six samples, therefore, the calculated erosion yields are less  than the actual erosion yields, because the mass loss would have been greater had there had been  more material. These six erosion yield values are highlighted in Table 21. Since the samples in  these cases appeared to have eroded partially or completely through at a fluence level close to the  full mission fluence, the measured erosion yields of these samples were still included in the data  set as estimates to develop a predictive erosion yield equation (Banks et al., 2009). These  samples have been reflown in LEO for actual erosion yield determination as part of the Stressed  PEACE Polymers experiment on MISSE 6 (de Groh et al., 2008, JAXA).   of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples (McCarthy et al., 2010). The highest fractional  uncertainty was for PA 66 (\u00b112.59 percent), and the lowest fractional uncertainty was for  ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) (\u00b12.56 percent). The average fractional uncertainty in  erosion yield was very small: \u00b13.30 percent.  *Darker blue cells indicate calculated erosion yields are less than the actual erosion yields.

NASA  GRC: Cleveland, OH                his Appendix provides details on the optical and thermal properties of the MISSE 2 PEACE  Polymers experiment after 4 years of space exposure, as documented in Waters et al., (2009).     and thermal property degradation of spacecraft materials, changes in the optical and thermal  properties of the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers samples as a result of LEO exposure have been  analyzed and compared with control samples to determine the extent of change on orbit.  otal and diffuse reflectance and total and diffuse transmittance were measured as a function of  wavelength and were compared with the corresponding values of non-exposed control samples.  Specular reflectance and specular transmittance were then computed. Thermal emittance data  were also generated. The wavelength-dependent data also allow for computation of the change in  solar absorptance and in thermal emittance, both of which are critical for predicting  thermal-control characteristics of a spacecraft.  any of the MISSE PEACE Polymer samples were comprised of several layers so as to survive  a 3-year LEO exposure. Because the mission was 3.95 years in duration, many of the polymers  were eroded through several layers; several were eroded through all layers in some places; and  one sample was completely eroded away. Therefore, it was determined that the best way to  measure the optical and thermal properties of the flight samples was to determine which layers of  each sample should be measured, based on the erosion pattern, and then to compare the same  number of layers of the control flight sample. If a sample was partially eroded, the layer or layers  that experienced partial erosion (rather than full erosion, as was the case with the layers above  partially eroded layers) along with the intact layer immediately underneath were analyzed, and  the control sample included the same number of layers, as shown in Figure 56, Schematic  Diagram of MISSE 2 Flight Sample Layer Erosion and the Corresponding Control Layers used  for Optical and Thermal Property Measurements. If the top layers would be damaged by  separation, the sample was left as a whole, and an equal number of control sample layers were  used for analysis.

(See Figure 57, Sample Holder for Optical and Thermal Measurements.) The front of  the sample holder recessed the sample by 0.013 cm, and the back of the holder allowed for a  cavity of up to 0.305 cm, depending on sample thickness.   Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 spectrophotometer was used to measure TR, DR, TT, and DT from  250 to 2500 nm. The instrument is equipped with a 15-cm Spectralon integrating sphere, shown  in Figure 58, Perkin Elmer Lambda 19 Spectrophotometer with Closeup of Integrating Sphere.  The SR and ST were calculated using the difference between total and diffuse values.  Absorptance data (1 \u2013 (reflectance + transmittance)) were integrated with respect to the air mass  zero solar spectrum to obtain \u03b1s. A Labsphere-certified Spectralon standard was used for  calibration. The beam size was checked for each of the samples to verify that optical alignment  was correct.

The equipment has a sample aperture  diameter of 1.27 cm. Automatic integration of infrared reflectivity with respect to blackbody  curves is used to calculate total \u03b5 for a user-selectable temperature range. Data were obtained at  200 K, 300 K, 400 K, 500 K, and 573 K. The samples were placed in the sample holder shown in  Figure 57 and were backed by a Gier Dunkle gold standard. The samples had to be placed upside  down on the instrument over an aperture opening and so needed to be mechanically stable  enough to remain stationary and not fall into the instrument during the 3.5-minute scan. Several  samples could not be analyzed because of mechanical instability.    efore thermal measurement of all the samples, a test was conducted to evaluate the effect of  using the sample holder on the resulting \u03b5 value. Pristine Kapton\uf0d2 H (127 \uf06dm thick) was first  measured directly on the instrument backed with a gold standard and then measured in the  sample holder with the gold standard backing the holder. Table 22, Kapton\uf0d2 Thermal Emittance                 Values with and without a Holder, shows the results of these measurements. There is a slight  increase in \u03b5 that is attributable to the sample holder, but the sample holder was needed to  minimize sample handling and to best preserve the delicate surface texture of the flight samples.  This difference will be more noticeable for transparent thin-film, transparent samples than for  thicker or opaque samples. Because of the interference of the sample holder, the thermal \u03b5 values  were not interpreted as absolute \u03b5 values and were used instead as more of a comparison tool.

These included PE (2-E5-9), PMMA (2-E5-16), PA 66 (2-E5-28), PI  (CP1, 2-E5-29), PBI (2-E5-35), and PET (2-E5-38). The samples too damaged to be mounted  upside down over the aperture opening on SOC 400T included PS (2-E5-15), PBO (2-E5-18),  and PPPA (2-E5-24).    ost-retrieval and control optical measurements, including TR, DR, TT, and DT, were taken of  the remaining samples and are listed in Table 23, Post-Retrieval and Control Optical Properties  Integrated from 250 to 2,500 nm. The calculated of the SR, ST, and \u03b1s values are also listed in  Table 23. The number of layers measured is also shown for each sample. Figure 60,  Absorptance, Total Reflectance, Total Transmittance, and Emittance Spectral Data for Flight and  Control Samples, provides the spectral data of \u03b1s, TR, and TT for each material and its  corresponding control sample.

TR generally increased at least slightly  with exposure; exceptions were mainly the fluorinated polymers and pyrolytic graphite. The DR  showed a significant increase with exposure for most materials because of surface texturing;  notable exceptions were PBO, polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), PPPA, pyrolytic graphite, and  PTFE. SR decreased with exposure for every sample measured, also because of surface  texturing, with the exception of PMR-15. PMR-15 had an eroded hole, which may have affected  its SR value. TT decreased with exposure for most samples measured, with the exceptions of  PBO, PPPA, and PTFE. DT increased significantly with exposure for most materials, but this  trend had many exceptions (PVF-W, POM, PEO, EP, PBT, polyurethane (PU), polycarbonate  (PC), and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). ST decreased with exposure for every sample with the  exceptions of PPPA and PTFE. With the exceptions of PPD-T, PMR-15, and PTFE, \u03b1s increased  with exposure.  emittance data over the wavelength range of 2 to 25 \u00b5m at various temperatures, as well as the  number of layers measured. Many of the \u03b5 values remained similar before and after space  exposure. Several materials, e.g., PU, FEP, and PTFE, experienced a decrease in \u03b5, possibly  caused by differences in thickness between the flight sample and the control sample. Many  materials showed an increase in \u03b5, most likely because of the development of cone structures on  the surface of the materials. PG showed the largest increase in \u03b5, along with the development of  a black velvet appearance after space exposure. Other samples that showed increased \u03b5 values  included POM, polyacrylonitrite (PAN), PEO, EP, PP, polysulfone (PSU), PEI, PI (Upilex-S\uf0d2),  PI (Kapton\uf0d2 H), and PEEK. It should be noted that the samples were all measured in the sample  holder, which was not flush with the SOC 400T face (there was a 0.013-cm gap) in an effort to  not damage the surface morphology. The gold standard used as a backing material for the  measurements was also separated from the sample by a 0.013-cm gap. Therefore, the values  obtained should not be interpreted as absolute values and should be used instead as a comparison  tool. Figure 60 provides graphs of the \u03b5 data for each material and its control sample.

The majority of the PEACE Polymer  samples were comprised of numerous thin-film layers stacked together. Because the MISSE 2  mission was much longer (3.95 years) than planned (1 year), one sample was completely eroded  away (PBI), and several other samples were severely degraded. Therefore, optical and thermal  measurements could not be obtained for all samples. Optical properties of 43 flight samples and  thermal properties of 40 flight samples were obtained and compared to those of the  corresponding control samples. Several trends were observed in the data. For most samples, SR  and DR characteristics changed greatly upon directed LEO atomic oxygen exposure; typically,  there was a decrease in SR and an increase in DR. These optical property changes affect glare  issues, Fresnel lens photovoltaic concentrator power loss issues, and issues with spatial  variations in the thermal load on a spacecraft. The wavelength-dependent data allowed for  computation of the changes in \u03b1s and thermal \uf065\uf02c which are critical data for predicting the thermal  control characteristics of a spacecraft. Because many of the PEACE Polymers are commonly  used for spacecraft applications, it is very important to understand potential changes in their  optical and thermal properties after long-term space exposure.   aters, D.L.; de Groh, K.K.; Banks, B.A.; Cameron, K.C.

APPENDIX E: LESSONS LEARNED FROM ATOMIC OXYGEN  INTERACTION WITH SPACECRAFT MATERIALS IN LOW  EARTH ORBIT   s a result of post-retrieval analyses of early MISSE experiments and space experiments such as  LDEF, valuable lessons have been learned and needs identified that are worthy of documentation  for use in the planning, design, and analysis of future space environment experiments. Some of  these lessons involve techniques, concepts, and issues associated with measuring atomic oxygen  erosion yields.  his appendix represents a collection of lessons with respect to atomic oxygen interactions  resulting from a variety of space experiments, as well as retrieved spacecraft materials and  components, such as from NASA\u2019s LDEF, NASA\u2019s EOIM III experiment, the Russian Space  Station Mir, NASA\u2019s MISSE 2, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency\u2019s (JAXA\u2019s) Service  Module/Micro-Particles Capturer & Space Environment Exposure Device (SM/MPAC &  SEED), and the Hubble Space Telescope (Banks et al., 2008). These are presented, along with  several issues to be considered when designing experiments, such as uncertainty in mission  duration, scattering and contamination effects on results, and the accuracy of measuring atomic  oxygen erosion. The collective experiences from these LEO flights provide useful considerations  for future experiments that involve atomic oxygen interaction with materials. The objective of  this appendix is to explain and capture these experiences to benefit the quality of future  spacecraft experiments and missions.     ritten instructions and procedures should be used for preparing, assembly, mounting, testing  and examination, or testing of coupon substrate and coated samples for flight experiments. Good  research practices, which provide repeatable results at the level of credibility requisite for space  flight hardware, should be used. Materials, processes, equipment, and systems are required to be  designed, procured, fabricated, assembled, tested, and inspected in accordance with Agency-,  program-, and project-specific quality assurance requirements.  Occasionally, written instructions and procedures for mounting and assembly of space flight  hardware are not followed closely by those who are tasked with final installation. An example of  this is the experience of one of the authors regarding an experiment on EOIM-III involving a  pinhole camera. The cover on the experiment contained a small hole that was to act as a lens for  the camera, and a written note was provided in the installation instructions with a warning to           \u201cnot remove the cover of the Pinhole Camera which contains the pinhole;\u201d however, post-flight  inspection of the Shuttle cargo bay containing the experiment revealed that the cover had in fact  been removed before flight and then had been reattached after removal of the hardware from the  cargo bay. Because the cover was reattached after removal from the Shuttle cargo bay, it  appeared to have been on during flight. The experiment was a total failure as a result of the  cover\u2019s removal before flight. High-resolution images of experiments taken just after launch can  help validate proper installation. Pictures taken at various time intervals throughout the duration  of the experiment can also provide valuable information about experiment function and material  degradation.      than initially planned because of a variety of factors that cannot be accurately predicted at the  time the experiments are being developed. Table 25, Comparison of Planned and Actual Mission  Durations, lists the planned and actual mission durations for four missions in which experiment  retrievals were accomplished (O\u2019Neal and Lightner, 1991; Silverman, 1995; Banks et al., 1993;  Pippin, 2006). The average mission lasted 2.63 times longer than initially planned.   Mission  LDEF  EURECA*  MISSE 1-2  MISSE 3-4  Planned Duration (yr) Actual Duration (yr) Ratio of Actual/Planned  5.75  0.89  3.95  1.04  1  0.83  1-1.5  1  5.75  1.07  2.64  1.04   the experiment so that the thicknesses of the samples used for atomic oxygen erosion yield  testing were three times thicker than what was needed to survive the original planned mission  duration (1 year), based on estimated erosion yields. This procedure resulted in 85 percent of the  material samples surviving the mission, which lasted four times longer than initially planned (de  Groh et al., 2008).   he lesson learned is to design experiments to survive a considerably longer duration \u2014 at least  three times longer than the planned mission duration \u2014 to ensure that meaningful results will be  obtained, even if the mission duration is significantly longer than planned. For example, multiple  layers of thin-film polymers can be stacked together rather than one single layer being flown.  ilicones that have not been vacuum-stripped frequently contain short-chain molecules that are  volatile and readily transported onto neighboring surfaces. Vacuum stripping consists of vacuum            removal of the short-chain, highly volatile components of the polymer before polymerization.  When these contaminated spacecraft surfaces are exposed to atomic oxygen in LEO, the  silicones oxidize to form silica (or silicates). Hydrocarbons can also be trapped on the surface  during this process. The resulting deposit can form an atomic-oxygen-protective coating that can  darken as a result of solar radiation exposure. Evidence of the consequence of silicone  contamination could be seen on selected samples flown on LDEF, as shown in Figure 61, Post-  Flight Photograph of Solar Array Materials Passive LDEF Experiment AO171, where several  samples outgassed volatile silicones (Banks et al, 1991). The photograph shows silicone RTV-  511 samples, the lighter color samples within the blue-bordered area. These samples were  exposed to an atomic oxygen fluence of 7.17\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2, with the atoms arriving from the  upper left at an angle of 38\uf0b0 from normal incidence. Some of the volatile silicone deposits on the  sample holder plate became oxidized by atomic oxygen. These became fixed on the surface and  darkened with UV radiation exposure. Where the volatile silicones were deposited and not  exposed to atomic oxygen, they gradually re-evaporated, and no darkening resulted, hence, the  light boundary to the right of the samples, shown in the enlarged picture.  Figure 61\u2014Post-Flight Photograph of Solar Array Materials Passive LDEF Experiment  AO171  n November 1997, Russian cosmonauts retrieved a non-articulating, foldable panel solar array  from the Mir core module after 10.4 years in LEO and returned it for an international cooperative  analysis (Visentine et al., 1999; Banks et al., 1999). The solar array panels included a clad  structure of solar cells, fiberglass scrim, cover glasses, optical solar reflectors, and an open-  weave organic fabric coated with BF-4 adhesive. Silicone adhesives and thread sutures were  used to clad the solar array structure together. Over time, volatile silicones (evolved from the  suture holes surrounding the solar cells on both sides of the solar array) became deposited on the  surface of the array. Figure 62, Oxidized Silicone Contamination on Solar Cell Components  from a Mir Solar Array Retrieved after 10.4 years in LEO, shows photographs of the silica  deposits on the front and back of Mir solar cells resulting from atomic oxygen oxidization of the  silicone adhesives that had been transported in the gaseous phase onto neighboring surfaces. The  thick contamination appears as a white diffuse deposit. On the front surface of the array, the               oxidized silicone contamination was up to 4.6 \u00b5m thick near suture sites (Figure 62(a)). On the  back surface of a solar reflector, a tape peel test was conducted (see the two black stripes at the  upper right corner of Figure 62(b)), which revealed that the contaminant layer was between 1.06  and 1.24 \u00b5m thick.  (a) Front surface of solar array with  contamination up to 4.6 \u03bcm thick near  suture sites  (b) Back surface of a solar reflector with  contaminants between 1.06 and 1.24 \u03bcm thick at tape  peel site  Figure 59\u2014Oxidized Silicone Contamination on Solar Cell Components from a Mir Solar  Array Retrieved after 10.4 years in LEO  Although the solar array did not significantly degrade in performance from the silica  contamination, there was significant darkening of the optical solar reflector surfaces and  neighboring thermal-control white paint surfaces. This solar array technology was also used for  the Russian-supplied solar array for the ISS. Silicone deposition onto surfaces on the ISS from  hardware such as this may result in contamination that could affect atomic oxygen erosion and  solar absorptance.  able 26, Silica-Based Contamination on ISS Experiment Surfaces, shows the large variation in  silica-based contamination on surfaces from experiments placed at different locations on the ISS  (Dever et al, 2006; Steagall et al., 2008). The MISSE PEC 2 had two orders of magnitude less  contaminant thickness than the three JAXA experiment units (Dever 2006, Steagall 2008.) This  is probably related to differences in the total arrival of silicones based on each experiment\u2019s  respective view of, and distance from, contaminant sources on the ISS.                       Contaminant  Thickness(nm)  Duration of  Exposure (yr)  Contaminant  Thickness/Year (nm)     Unit 1, ram facing  Unit 2, ram facing  Unit 3, ram facing   30.0  75.0  93.5   0.863  2.37  3.84   34.8  31.7  24.3  experiment self-contamination. Experiments should also be out of the view of other sources of  silicone to be sure that atomic oxygen does not produce silica deposits that can affect erosion  yields or cause changes in solar absorptance.    t has long been suspected that some of the atomic oxygen arriving at a surface will scatter with  partial accommodation from surfaces with which the atomic oxygen reacts, as well as from non-  reactive surfaces, such as most metal oxides (Banks et al., 2002; Banks et al., 2003; Banks et al.,  2006). The scattered, un-reacted oxygen atoms can travel in a line-of-sight manner until they  encounter another surface, where they may react, recombine, or scatter again. This can occur  over thousands of meters. However, only recently have quantifiable scattering data been  available, from a small scattering chamber flown on MISSE 2. The experiment consisted of a  2.54-cm-diameter scattering chamber containing a SiO2-coated (on the ram-facing surface only)  polyimide Kapton\uf0d2 H disk with a 3.05-mm-diameter aperture that allowed atomic oxygen to  enter the chamber. The atomic oxygen would then scatter off an Al disk and react with the  Kapton\uf0d2 on the bottom of the aperture disk. The bottom of the aperture disk was also coated in  many microscopic salt particles, which served as protective areas from scattered atomic oxygen  attack. Figure 63, MISSE 2 Atomic Oxygen Scattering Chamber Experiment, shows the  experiment setup, and Figure 64, Kapton\uf0d2 H Butte Remaining at Site of Protective Salt Particle,  shows a salt particle site. After the salt particles were washed off, the amount of atomic oxygen  erosion was measured as a function of ejection angle using profilometry. Although cosine (or  Lambertian) scattering had been expected, the results indicated that normal incident atomic  oxygen scattered in a rather narrow angular distribution, at approximately 45\uf0b0 from normal, as  shown in Figure 65, Atomic Oxygen Erosion as a Function of Ejection Angle. The scattered  atomic oxygen produced a surprisingly high effective erosion yield: 21.8 percent of that of ram  atomic oxygen for Kapton\uf0d2 H polyimide (Banks et al., 2006).  he lesson learned is that atomic oxygen does not scatter in a cosine distribution or in a specular  direction but instead at 45\uf0b0 from normal for Al. This means that scattered atomic oxygen erosion  of materials must be considered, depending upon the particular geometry of a spacecraft.                                                         0.006   0.006      0.004   0.004  0.003   0.003     0.002   0.002     0.001   0.001   0.000   0.000   0.000  0.005   0.005        Incoming Atomic Oxygen                         sample trays with chamfered circular apertures can allow atomic oxygen to scatter from the  chamfered surfaces onto the samples, thus locally increasing the flux, as shown in Figure 66,  Flux Concentration from Chamfered MISSE Sample Holders. A consequence of the perimeter-  scattered atomic oxygen is that the erosion around the sample perimeter is greater than in the  central area. An example of this for measurements of the MISSE 2 PEACE PEO sample is  shown in Figure 67, Comparison of Pre- and Post-Flight Surface Profiles for the PEO Sample  (2-E5-17). If the atomic oxygen is arriving off normal, then there will be a variation in flux  around the perimeter of each sample depending on the scattering geometry. As can be seen in  Figure 68, MISSE 2 Tray 1 E5 Showing Samples Peeling up on Their Lower-Left Sides, two of  the MISSE 2 samples peeled up from their lower left edge, and atomic oxygen was found to be  arriving at 8\uf0b0 from normal and coming from the upper right direction. Therefore, there appears to  be a flux concentration near the perimeter of the samples from the atomic oxygen that impinged  upon the chamfered surface.     Figure 64\u2014Comparison of Pre- and Post-Flight Surface Profiles for the PEO Sample (2 E5  17)    Polymer   Aluminum  Preflight   Preflight   Preflight   Post flight   Post flight   Post flight   Not to scale                Figure 65\u2014MISSE 2 Tray 1 E5 Showing Two Samples Peeling up on Their Lower-Left  Sides   lip was 0.763 mm thick. The maximum possible additional fluence for 2.54-cm-diameter  samples caused by atomic oxygen scattering would be ~15 percent but, based on the previously  discussed scattering chamber experiments, is more likely ~3.3 percent. Therefore, the concern is  not a higher average fluence but rather sample peeling and potential release before full sample  erosion, which could lead to incorrect erosion yield calculations.   chamfer were used on the sample holders, which would prevent scattering of atomic oxygen onto  the sample surfaces. A potential disadvantage of this would be the loss of intimate contact at the  edge of the sample, which is used for profiling purposes, but this would not be a concern for  mass loss measurements.  he lesson learned is that sample holder chamfers can be a source of flux concentrations, which  can disproportionately erode the perimeters of samples and, in some cases, cause the samples to  roll up or potentially be released before full sample erosion. This problem could be eliminated by  using a reverse chamfer on the sample holder.                       nderstanding the exact orientation of atomic oxygen arrival and arrival of contaminants can be  very helpful in interpretation of environmental degradation results. Often, this information can be  determined if the orientation of samples is documented before their removal from experiment  trays. The exact orientation of the MISSE 2 atomic-oxygen-scattering chamber lid was  documented, which allowed for the determination that holes had been drilled as a result of  atomic oxygen arriving at 8\uf0b0 off-normal incidence and coming from the upper left of the  photograph in Figure 68 (Banks et al., 2006). This explained the preferential cutting out and  peeling of thin samples around the lower left perimeter, as shown in Figure 68.  E.3.6 Documentation of Sample Orientations with Respect to Atomic Oxygen Ram  Direction  he lesson learned is that critical information can be gained by either marking samples for  orientation or photo-documenting the experiment before sample removal to determine sample  orientation.   he time between retrieval of samples from space and ground-laboratory tensile testing can have  a significant impact on the elongation-to-failure results for FEP and possibly other polymers that  have been exposed to the LEO environment. For example, samples of 0.127-mm-thick silvered  FEP (Ag-FEP) retrieved from the wake side (rows 1 and 4) of the LDEF in January 1990 and  aluminized-FEP (Al-FEP) retrieved from the HST retrieved in December 1993 indicated a  significant reduction in elongation-to-failure as time progressed after the retrieval dates (Banks et  al.,1998; de Groh and Gummow, 2001), as shown in Figure 69, Reduction in Elongation-to-  Failure as a Result of Time after Retrieval for Ag-FEP and Al-FEP. Samples were taken from  near-neighbor locations in both cases. Interestingly, the reduction in elongation-to-failure  appears to continue long after radiation exposure occurs; this is thought to be caused by the  formation and presence of long-lived free radicals (Judeikis et al., 1968; Li et al., 2005).           Figure 66\u2014Reduction in Elongation-to-Failure as a Result of Time after Retrieval for Ag  FEP and Al FEP  Ground testing also indicated that storage of FEP samples in a vacuum slows the rate of tensile  property degradation (de Groh and Morgana, 2004). Polymer chain scission is believed to be  responsible for the degradation of FEP and is initiated by the impact of energetic electrons and  protons combined with thermal exposure (Townsend et al., 1999). Storing samples in air or  elevated temperatures increases degradation rates as compared to storage in vacuum or low  temperatures (Dever et al., 1999).  he lesson learned is that to properly evaluate radiation-induced tensile property damage in  thin-film polymers, it is important to store samples in vacuum and at low (room) temperatures  and to test them as soon as possible after retrieval. Use of multiple samples stored and tested  over time after retrieval may allow back-extrapolation to the in-space properties if the  degradation profile follows an exponential decay curve.    fact that cone-and-valley formation can result in erosion occurring through more than one  stacked polymer sheet, as seen in Figure 70, MISSE 2 PEEK Sample Stack Showing Partial  Erosion of the Fourth and Fifth Layers. Figure 71, Atomic Oxygen Texturing Occurring across  Two Layers of a Flight Stack of Polymer Samples, illustrates how the valleys between the cones  can extend into a lower sample layer by providing a pathway for atomic oxygen to erode the  layer below. This renders erosion yield measurement based on profilometry very inaccurate  because the erosion is through (at least) two separate layers.               Figure 70\u2014MISSE 2 PEEK Sample Stack Showing Partial Erosion of the Fourth and Fifth  Layers    Figure 71\u2014Atomic Oxygen Texturing Occurring across Two Layers of a Flight Stack of  Polymer Samples    ehydrated weight loss measurements can easily take this complication into account. Complete  dehydration of samples is very important to avoid weight inaccuracies related to variations in the  degree of absorbed water in the samples. However, for erosion yield determination based on  mass loss, the densities of the samples need to be accurately known, and this information is not  always readily available.           10micron   10micron              ost polymers contain some fraction of inorganic material. As atomic oxygen erodes a polymer  that contains inorganic material, the resulting nonvolatile ash begins to accumulate on the eroded  surface of the polymer. For high-fluence missions, such as the MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers  experiment (for which the fluence was 8.43\uf0b41021 atoms/cm2) (de Groh et al., 2008), the  underlying polymer can gradually become somewhat shielded from reacting with atomic oxygen.  Therefore, it is theorized that a polymer\u2019s ash content has an effect on its erosion yield. Table 27,  Comparison of the Erosion Yields of Two Pairs of Chemically Similar Polymers with Different  Ash Contents, lists the erosion yields for two pairs of MISSE 2 PEACE Polymers that shared  similar chemical structures. The data (de Groh et al., 2008) show that, in spite of the similar  structures, the polymers\u2019 erosion yields differed, based largely on their ash content, which was  measured by weighing and then exposing samples of the polymers (held in small Al foil cups) to  atomic oxygen in an RF plasma asher until further weight loss occurred, which indicated that all  the polymer was oxidized and only ash remained.

These lessons include the following:  . Care should be taken to avoid experiment self-contamination and to place  experiments out of the view of sources of silicone to reduce the possibility that volatile silicone  deposits and atomic oxygen will react to produce silica deposits, which can affect erosion yields  and cause changes in solar absorptance.                        instead at 45\uf0b0 from normal for Al. This means that the geometry of the spacecraft, which may  lead to scattered atomic oxygen erosion of materials, should be taken into consideration.   perimeter of thin samples and, in some cases, cause the samples to roll up or be released before  full sample erosion.  . Samples to be evaluated for atomic oxygen interaction or durability evaluation should  be marked so that their orientation is known. This allows for potential determination of causes of  anomalous behavior with respect to the ram direction or possible contamination.  . To properly evaluate radiation-induced tensile property damage in thin-film  polymers, it is important to store samples in vacuum and at low (room) temperatures and to test  them as soon as possible after retrieval.     high-fluence missions. This should be taken into account when projecting the durability of a  polymer being exposed to atomic oxygen.  Protection of Materials from Atomic Oxygen Attack in Low Earth Orbit.

Organizations procuring other metallic and nonmetallic materials  for flight applications should use due diligence to ensure such materials meet the requirements  for specifications used in the procurement process.  his NASA Technical Handbook focuses on product forms referred to as sheet, strip, plate,  forging, and bar, i.e., forms covered by the American Materials Specifications (AMSs) that  supersede MIL-T-9046, Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Sheet, Strip, and Plate, and MIL-T-9047,  Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Bars (Rolled or Forged) and Reforging Stock, Aircraft Quality,  and that are primarily related to the nonconforming Ti alloy issue. The other AMS specifications  covering product forms such as tubing, casting, extruded parts, or fasteners are not implicated in  the nonconforming Ti alloy issue.  equests for information should be submitted via \u201cFeedback\u201d at https://standards.nasa.gov.

These guidelines  may be tailored to the program applications to obtain the most cost-effective, best quality  product.   his NASA Technical Handbook is applicable to NASA Centers and NASA programs utilizing  wrought Ti alloys for flight hardware, mission-critical ground support equipment, and elements  thereof.  his NASA Technical Handbook is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers and Facilities.

Handbook. Government specifications were originally developed and subsequently transformed  from military specifications to non-Government standard documents, such as the Aerospace  Materials Specifications (AMSs) for Ti alloys commercially available now. These specifications  have documented processing requirements and well-established minimum property values for  various product forms.   completeness, the following two Ti alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, are the two primary  alloys of interest. Most of the investigations into potential nonconforming Ti alloys occurred in  the mid to late 2000s and were centered on these two alloys. United States Air Force (USAF)  investigations into nonconforming Ti alloys first addressed Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn and, subsequently in  the late 2000s, included Ti-6Al-4V. NASA investigations, predominately in the late 2000s,  focused on Ti-6Al-4V, as this alloy had the most flight applications by a large number. However,  the procedures and processes described in this document can be applied to other Ti alloys.  Commercially pure Ti is generally not considered an issue because of its lack of sensitivity to  heat treating and thermo-mechanical processing.    he two original military documents for Ti and Ti alloys (MIL-T-9046, Titanium and Titanium  Alloy, Sheet, Strip, and Plate, and MIL-T-9047, Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Bars (Rolled or  Forged) and Reforging Stock, Aircraft Quality) have been replaced by approximately 55 AMS  non-Government standards. ASTM International (ASTM, formerly the American Society for  Testing and Materials) specifications are not listed in this NASA Technical Handbook because  of a shortfall of aerospace quality procurement requirements. However, a Center could utilize  ASTM specifications for non-flight applications and/or add additional requirements to the  procurement documents for flight applications.  .1.1 The latest issuances of cited documents shall apply unless specific versions are  designated.  .1.2 Non-use of specifically designated versions shall be approved by the responsible  Technical Authority.

Therefore,  according to table 1, the applicable procurement specifications for Ti-6Al-4V annealed bars and  forgings and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn annealed bars and forgings are SAE AMS6931 and SAE AMS6936,  respectively.   hese two SAE AMS specifications have similar requirements to the last revised MIL-T-9047G,  Amendment 2. There is one divergence of interest with respect to maximum cross-sectional area  of tested material: SAE AMS6931 specifies minimum mechanical properties for stock with a  maximum cross-sectional area of 309.68 cm2 (48 in2) instead of 103.23 mm2 (16 in2) in MIL-T-  9047G, Amendment 2.

As indicated in table 2, applicable procurement specifications for Ti-6Al-4V  annealed sheet, strip, and plate and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn annealed sheet, strip, and plate are SAE  AMS4911 and SAE AMS4918, respectively.  hese two AMS specifications have requirements similar to MIL-T-9046J, Amendment 2. In  addition, the latest SAE AMS4911 and SAE AMS4918 assert in section 3.3.2, \u201cPlate product  shall be produced using standard industry practices designed strictly for the production of plate  stock to the procured thickness. Bar, billet, forgings, or forging stock shall not be supplied in lieu  of plate.\u201d                 that might be relevant to procurement of Ti-6Al-4V material in the annealed condition,  specifically in bar and forging forms. SAE AMS4928 covers Ti-6Al-4V bars, wires, forgings,  rings, and drawn shapes in annealed condition. When compared with SAE AMS6931, which  superseded SAE AMS-T-9047, SAE AMS4928 does not specify any maximum cross-sectional  area of tested material nor does it specify macrostructure and ultrasonic inspection requirements.  SAE AMS4928 also allows a solution heat treatment (HT) in a mill-annealed material. This is  not permitted in any other mill-annealed specification. Solution HT increases strength at the  expense of fracture toughness. However, SAE AMS4928 has a more stringent requirement on  hydrogen content (maximum 125 ppm versus 150 ppm in SAE AMS6931) and higher tensile and  yield strength requirements for bars up to 50.8 mm (2 in) in thickness (931 MPa (135 ksi) and  862 MPa (125 ksi) versus 896 MPa (130 ksi) and 827 MPa (120 ksi) in SAE AMS6931).  Additional requirements can always be added to procurement documentation if this specification  needs to be utilized, thereby facilitating material purchased in accordance with this specification  to be acceptable for flight.  specifications, coupled with careful review of the certification data package, is required to assure  that material has been properly processed and certified.   material. However, this specification does not include requirements for microstructure,  macrostructure, and ultrasonic inspection and is not recommended for procurement of  aircraft-/space-quality Ti and Ti alloys for flight application without the use of additional  requirements to address noted shortfalls or performance of additional testing by procuring  organizations.       product begins as an ingot: in vacuum, a molten Ti alloy is allowed to solidify in a mold.  Example Ti alloy ingot diameters are 71.1 cm (28 in), 76.2 cm (30 in), and 91.4 cm (36 in).  he ingot is then typically hot worked in a forging press into the products referred to as billets,  slabs, or blocks. These partially forged, semi-finished materials are created as feedstock for final  processing. The semi-finished materials are intermediate products generally not intended for  finished products. Intermediate products require additional hot rolling, hot forging, or extruding  processes (also generally referred to as metallurgical working operations) to produce wrought  end-product shapes for aerospace applications. A typical fabrication process for aerospace-  quality wrought Ti alloy finished products is shown in figure 1, Fabrication Process of Wrought  Ti Alloys. (Figure 1 is modified from Calcaterra, 2009.)        The primary mill sources for ingots of Ti alloy in the U.S. include Allegheny Technologies  Incorporated (ATI) Allvac, RTI International (formerly Research Triangle Institute), and  Titanium Metals Corporation (Timet). These companies supply ingots to conversion houses that  forge and/or hot roll the ingot into intermediate products. Primary mill sources may also produce  intermediate or end-product forms.  xamples of end-product shapes intended for use in aerospace systems include bar (round or  rectangular), plate, sheet, strip, and wire. Some specifications also include a product form called  forging stock, which is the same as billet or intermediate product to be used for further  processing.  he complex microstructures of Ti alloys are developed from combined thermal-mechanical  processing of as-cast ingots through intermediate to the final product forms. The microstructure  and hence the mechanical properties of Ti alloys are dependent on the fabrication scheme and the  thermal history. Multiple cycles of work (heating, forging, rolling, and cooling) are required to  achieve the desired microstructure required for thin plate and sheet products used for flight  applications. Intermediate product forms may not have been worked sufficiently to produce the  microstructure necessary to achieve minimum acceptable specification-based mechanical  properties across the entire cross section. If, because of the size of a Ti alloy part to be  fabricated, intermediate product sizes such as billets of greater than 15.2 cm (6 in) thickness need  to be procured, the procuring organization can specify slightly lower minimum mechanical  properties than typical for thinner plate material. Based on information from USAF and JPL test  programs (discussed in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 in this NASA Technical Handbook), only 5 to 10  percent reductions in tensile ultimate strength (Ftu) and tensile yield strength (Fty), respectively,  may be sufficient to bound the minimum mechanical properties of the billet material. However,  there are significant deviations in secondary properties. Specifically noteworthy are impacts to           fatigue and other dynamic mechanical properties, which are described further in section 5.3.2 of  this NASA Technical Handbook.  In addition to thermo-mechanical processing, Ti alloy mechanical properties are strongly  dependent on heat treatment. Ti-6Al-4V is commonly specified in either an annealed or an STA  condition. Annealing requires that the entire cross section be maintained at 704.4 \u00b0C (1,300 \u00b0F)  for 1 hour minimum, followed by furnace cooling, if maximum ductility, i.e., high percent  elongation and percent reduction of area at failure, is required. Note: Most specifications give a  temperature range with 704.4 \u00b0C (1,300 \u00b0F) as a minimum. Also, most specifications make a  reference to section thickness driving the time at temperature. SAE AMS-H-81200, Heat  Treatment of Titanium and Titanium Alloys, offers the following guidance in selecting soak  times:      annealed Ti 6Al-4V material are 827 MPa (120,000 psi) and 896 MPa (130,000 psi),  respectively. Carefully developed thermal processes exist for STA conditions. The resulting  effects of these thermal processes on minimum strength values as a function of plate thickness  can be seen in figure 2, Specification Minimum Strength Sensitivity of Ti-6Al-4V Sheet, Strip,  and Plate as a Function of Heat Treatment, Thickness, and Interstitial Element Level.  Figure 2\u2014 Specification Minimum Strength Sensitivity of Ti-6Al-4V Sheet, Strip, and Plate  as a Function of Heat Treatment, Thickness, and Interstitial Element Level              60  Wrought Material Dimension (mm)                                 Mills, conversion houses, or heat treatment shops use an acid treatment, referred to as pickling,  to remove the scale and/or an alpha case from material not heat treated in vacuum or suitable  inert gas environments. This etching process can be an issue regarding the generation of  hydrogen embrittlement; therefore, a hydrogen content determination test, e.g., in accordance  with ASTM E 1447, Standard Test Method for Determination of Hydrogen in Titanium and  Titanium Alloys by Inert Gas Fusion Thermal Conductivity/Infrared Detection Method, of final  products is required, and the test result should be included in the material certification package.  Also, because of the tendency of prestressed Ti alloys to crack while in contact with certain  chemical reagents, it is necessary to ensure that materials used during processing, testing, and  inspection, including ultrasonic couplants, will not initiate stress corrosion of titanium alloys.  ASTM F 945, Standard Test Method for Stress-Corrosion of Titanium Alloys by Aircraft Engine  Cleaning Materials, can be used for dealing with the contact material compatibility issue.   a \u201cplate product shall be produced using standard industry practices designed strictly for the  production of plate stock to the procured thickness. Bar, billet, forgings, or forging stock shall  not be supplied in lieu of plate.\u201d No matter whether the previous practice for any Ti alloy  supplier has included cutting down billet thicknesses, this practice is not standard.   be processed to the final thickness/diameter by metallurgical working operations. Bar shall not  be cut from plate. It is not allowed to cut a plate along its longitudinal direction and make a  bar. If cutting in the longitudinal direction is done, the product still needs to be identified as plate  stock. The customer may agree on the substitution, but the bar product from the plate stock  cannot be certified as bar stock. Cut strip from the plate without further thickness reductions is  acceptable, as noted above. However, it is important to maintain grain direction knowledge of  cut samples. In addition, it should be clear that cutting billet is permitted if the cut pieces are  subsequently hot or cold worked. This is a common industrial practice and completely  acceptable.    NASA organizations or associated contractors by material distributors or secondary processing  plants/companies, also referred to as conversion houses. For NASA flight program applications,  the use of an appropriate material specification as a part of the procurement process is standard  practice.   extrude) starting material into finished forms. Conversion houses have the in-house capability to  perform some or all of the standard hot-working operations. Starting material for conversion  houses may be referred to as forging stock, billet, or various other names. On the other hand,  most Ti alloy distributors have only capabilities to cut stock with low-speed band saws or high-  speed circular saws to meet size demands (different lengths and/or widths of a given thickness  plate) of customers. Neither low- nor high-speed cutting is considered to be a metallurgical  working operation or hot working.       A material distributor may place orders to build up internal stock from conversion houses for  finished products or procure intermediate products, e.g., billets or thick plate stock, or even  procure Ti alloy ingots directly from Ti alloy mills. These intermediate products and ingots  would subsequently be sent back out for hot working to meet a specific customer need. When an  ingot is hot worked, it is considered a wrought product. Wrought products are divided into  intermediate products and finished products. The thickness of wrought products is reduced  through the hot-working process. An ingot is considered a cast shape.   there is a part configuration issue, e.g., size/thickness, which precludes the use of finished  products. If the stock to be used is larger than what the specification allows/requires, it still  should be worked in the alpha-beta range to its final dimensions. Also, a purchaser needs to have  an agreement on the minimum non-specification-based mechanical properties. However, all of  the other specification requirements should apply. SAE AMS6931 and SAE AMS4911  specifications define what are considered finished plate and bar materials, respectively, and  describe how these products shall be processed. (See section 4.3 in this NASA Technical  Handbook.) Exceptions must be carefully dealt with by knowledgeable design, stress, and  materials/processing engineers or manufacturing engineering personnel so that the proper  minimum property values are used in the design, analysis, and verification activities.  he boundary size between billet and end product is alloy dependent. For example, Ti-6Al-6V-  2Sn is generally 20,645 mm2 (32 in2), Ti-6Al-4V is 309.68 cm2 (48 in2), and TI-6Al-4V ELI is  103.23 cm2 (16 in2). Intermediate product forms for Ti-6Al-4V, such as billets, are generally  considered to possess cross sections of greater than 309.68 cm2 (48 in2), but some specifications  are more stringent and stipulate that product forms with greater than 103.23 cm2 (16 in2) be  considered an intermediate product form. For example, ASTM B348 defines a billet as a solid  semi-finished section hot rolled or forged from an ingot with a cross-sectional area greater than  103.23 cm2 (16 in2) whose width is less than 5 times its thickness. SAE AMS6931 alternatively  requires a maximal cross-sectional area of 309.70 cm2 (48 in2) (with no stipulation for  relationship of width to thickness) of tested forging product instead of the original 103.23 cm2  (16 in2) maximum required by MIL-T-9047G, Amendment 2. The specification words referring  to \u201cof tested material\u201d are related to the requirement to extract mechanical test coupons, such as  tensile test coupons, from material that has less than the 309.68 cm2 (48 in2) cross section.   mechanical properties are a requirement, and if the material does not meet them, it can be  rejected. If the cross-sectional area is above the limit, then the mechanical properties are for  information only and cannot be used to reject the material, unless there is a pre-established  agreement between the procuring parties. While any size can be ordered, the procuring party  should be aware of when the specifications apply and when they do not.  s discussed in section 5.3.2 of this document, some data have emerged recently (AFRL-RX-  WP-TR-2012-0238, Quick Reaction Evaluation of Materials and Processes (QRE), tending to  show that barely acceptable tensile property values are attainable for semi-finished billets with  cross-sectional areas several times greater than 309.68 cm2 (48 in2). Caution is urged in this area  as the testing only represents large billets from one conversion house. On the other hand, the       USAF test program on large cross-sectional area billets indicated up to 70-percent knockdown in  fatigue life when compared with the control plate.  ntermediate product forms may not have been worked sufficiently to produce the microstructure  necessary to achieve minimum specification mechanical properties across the entire cross  section. It is possible, based on the above-mentioned extensive mechanical testing conducted by  the USAF, with some supporting evidence from JPL D-69922, Report of the Titanium Working  Group Concerning the Assessment of Non-Conforming Material as it Affects JPL Flight  Projects, that Ti-6Al-4V billet (unlike Ti-6AL-6V-2Sn material produced to USAF  requirements) can just meet the minimum mechanical values specified in AMS specifications for  plate material greater than 152 mm (6 in) thick. However, JPL has also performed mechanical  testing on suspected Ti-6AL-4V billet material provided as if the material was in a finished  product shape with relevant material certifications and found several lots of material that  exhibited mechanical properties just below minimum specification values. For example, out of  122 tensile test coupons made from 4 suspect lots of Ti-6Al-4V, 25 percent of test coupons failed  to meet the specified minimum tensile yield strength, 4 percent of coupons failed to meet the  minimum ultimate strength, and 53 percent of coupons failed to meet the minimum reduction in  area. These data are discussed further in section 5.3.3 in this NASA Technical Handbook.  distributors, conversion houses, or mills as part of standard procurement or acquisition processes.  In the case of procured finished products or parts, certification packages are supplied by the  vendors providing the finished parts. The certification package is to contain, as a minimum, the  information outlined in the material specification for finished material provided by a mill. In  addition, if material is processed by a conversion house, the original mill certification, the  conversion house certification, the heat treatment certification, the hydrogen content test report,  mechanical test data, ultrasonic inspection test report, micro/macrostructure evaluation, and any  other quality assurance data required by the specification are also to be provided.    he material certification should contain all the test results and/or verification that the material  meets all of the requirements contained in the applicable material specification. If the material  was procured from a mill or from a distributor that obtained the material in its final form from a  mill, this information will be in a mill certification. If the distributer had an intermediate product  converted into the final form, the certification should contain the original certification for the  ingot or billet, the certification from the conversion house (including starting size of billet and  the finish size), the certification from the heat-treat supplier, and the results for the ultrasonic  inspection, mechanical property testing, and the macrostructure and microstructure examinations.         Government specification to which it was certified specifically to the final products, such  as a plate, sheet, and forged bar.     key aspect of the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) documents  associated with nonconforming Ti alloys (listed in Appendix B of this NASA Technical  Handbook) has been the allegation that some suppliers have delivered final product forms,  namely bar and plate, that have been cut from intermediate product forms without the necessary  additional thermo-mechanical working, a product called a cut-down billet. Moreover, it is  alleged that material certification data associated with these final product forms were derived  from test coupons drawn from prime locations within the intermediate products that may not be  representative of the cross section from which the final products were obtained.    and SAE AMS4904, Titanium Alloy Sheet, Strip, and Plate 6Al-4V Solution Heat  Treated and Aged. A forged plate thickness is produced as a part of the forging operation,  i.e., no cutting of plate thickness occurs. These two specifications, along with most other  Ti alloy specifications, require plate to be fabricated by rolling, not forging. Forging is  not a valid method to produce Ti alloy plate. A plate fabricated by forging may not have  been worked sufficiently to meet the minimum mechanical property specifications  required by rolled plate in the aforementioned specifications.   Cut-down billet. This material is unlikely to have been sufficiently mechanically worked  to meet the minimum mechanical specifications of SAE AMS4911 and SAE AMS4904  for rolled sheet and plate or by SAE AMS6931 for forged bar. The lack of mechanical  work is related to the larger cross section. Ti alloys supplied to DoD and NASA contracts  are to conform to all contract requirements, including specifications cited in such  contracts. When rolled plate is specified, the Ti alloy is to be rolled to the required  thickness using industry standard practices. When bar is specified, the Ti alloy is to be  hot worked to the required dimensions. The required Ti alloy dimensions are not to be  accomplished by cutting down a thicker material. Almost all Ti alloy specifications  specifically prohibit this practice. Cutting plate and bar stock to create the desired length  of product to meet customer requirements is standard acceptable practice.                  vidence began accumulating that Ti alloys were being delivered from metal distributors to the  industrial supply chain without having been processed in accordance with specification and that  these materials could have strength properties below specification minimum values.  response to GIDEP releases dating from as early as 2004. The concern for inappropriate  processing of Ti alloys does not extend to primary mills but rather to the distributors.   nvestigation by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Air Force\u2019s repository of  materials and manufacturing expertise for Ti, ultimately led to a federal indictment (case number  3:08-cr-04229 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California) by the U.S.  Department of Justice against the primary and other distributor companies. The case proceeded  to trial in the fall of 2010, resulting in a plea agreement involving the imposition of a fine and  payment of restitution to the U.S. Government.  he federal indictment alleged that nonconforming, cut-down Ti alloy billet was being sold as  forged and rolled sheet, strip, bar, and plate. Other finished product forms (castings, sheet, strip,  extrusions, die forgings, rod, and wire) were not implicated.  ASA and NASA contract engineers must design components assuming minimum strength and  ductility related values that will be delivered by procured materials. If a material is not processed  in accordance with relevant specification, the engineer\u2019s design can be unknowingly  compromised. This could lead to flight project hardware designs having inadequate structural  margin, leading to structural failures and possibly mission failures.   deflections, such as in cantilever beam members, lower buckling margins for compression  structure, and changes in natural frequencies.     thermal and mechanical processing, which gives them their superior mechanical properties.  These microstructures and, hence, the alloy\u2019s mechanical properties are sensitive to the  material\u2019s processing history. Failure to properly process Ti alloy can result in lower than  specified (nonconforming) mechanical properties. The key mechanical properties are:  \uf0b7 Tensile Ultimate Strength (Ftu)  \uf0b7 Tensile Elastic Modulus (E)  \uf0b7 Tensile Yield Strength (Fty)  \uf0b7 Elongation (El)  \uf0b7 Reduction of Area (RA)        reviously mentioned JPL mechanical testing (JPL D-69922) was focused on tensile properties.  In addition to extensive static mechanical property testing, the nonconforming Ti alloy testing at  AFRL (Calcaterra, 2009) included dynamic and damage tolerance properties. Reduced dynamic  properties could result in possible service life impacts such as decreased crack initiation life,  increased fatigue crack growth rate, and decreased fracture toughness. These impacts can result  in shorter part lives and reduced inspection intervals.        improperly processed material inconsistent with plate in accordance with SAE AMS-  T-9046.   \u2013 32 specimens (37 percent) did not meet Ftu specification minimum.  \u2013 19 specimens (22 percent) did not meet Fty specification minimum.  \u2013 Crack growth rate on 37 specimens was 4 times faster than rolled plate.  ubsequent to the testing discussed in section 5.3.1 above, the USAF embarked on a large billet-  level test program for assessing the degree to which mechanical properties of such material met  minimum specification values. This test program was designed to develop property data on a  specific billet form obtained from one conversion house of two Ti alloys (Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-  6V-2Sn) representing incomplete thermal-mechanical processed material.   cm (24 in) x 48.3 cm (19 in) x 16.5 cm (6.5 in) and of 61 cm (24 in) x 114 cm (45 in) x 16.5 cm  (6.5 in). Two Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn billets were fabricated for this program to thicknesses prescribed  by AFRL to produce two different levels of hot working in the material. These billets had  nominal dimensions of 30.4 cm (12 in) x 267 cm (105 in) x 11.4 cm (4.5 in) and 30.4 cm (12 in)  x 203 cm (80 in) x 20.3 cm (8 in). Both alloys were produced in accordance with the SAE AMS-  T-9047 specification that covers reforging stock and were delivered in the mill-annealed heat-  treat condition.      \uf0b7 Fatigue Limit ( Sf)  \uf0b7 Fracture Toughness ( KIc)  \uf0b7 Fatigue Crack Growth Rate (da/dN)  \uf0b7 Corrosion and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) resistance.         Significant numbers of test coupons were fabricated for tensile, fatigue (both stress versus  number of cycles fatigue curve (S-N) and strain versus number of cycles fatigue curve (\uf065-N)),  da/dN, KIc, and SCC testing. For example, for the Ti-6Al-4V material alone, over 300 tensile test  coupons were fabricated and tested.   Incompletely Processed Ti Alloys in Annealed Condition. The test data are compared with the  required tensile properties of plate and sheet in accordance with SAE AMS-T-9046. The decision  to refer to these baseline values as reasonable lower bounds (RLBs) was based on the fact that an  insufficient quantity of material heats and lots were represented for the calculation of traditional  MMPDS A- or B-, or even S-basis allowables (AFRL-RX-WP-TR-2012-0238). However, the  number of specimens tested (often in replicate) is significant. Thus RLB was chosen by the  USAF Ti Task Force as an acceptable term to describe properties derived from the testing of  multiple specimens from the two heats (per alloy) of material in this program. While these do not  meet the requirements for standard baseline property determination, they are, nevertheless,  significant. Under normal circumstances, three heats of material would be needed for  establishing a specification minimum (S-basis) value; whereas 10 heats of material would be  required for A- and B-basis allowables.  ductility (El and RA) RLB values were determined by the lowest value in the population. For the  durability and damage tolerance properties (Sf, da/dN, and KIc), a life factor was determined that  compared the properties of the improperly processed alloys with baseline properties generated  from control plates.   or stiffness-driven designs of space structures, there can be concerns over degraded (lower)  elastic modulus values. There were no independent tests, such as ultrasonics, conducted and/or  vibration techniques to verify degraded values indicated in this section. Organizations are  encouraged to verify off-nominal elastic modulus test values through an independent test  technique if there are structural deflection concerns.   major conclusion of the report is that engineers and designers should account for reduced  properties when assessing the integrity and safety of components made with non-conforming  materials.

However, if  maintenance intervals are found to be unacceptable during an initial screening using the published factors, a program  may conduct further analysis using the full range of the test data provided by AFRL, supplemented, as appropriate,  with test data and analysis generated by the program.         uring the course of the nonconforming Ti alloy assessment at JPL, materials and process  (M&P) engineers reviewed approximately 1,000 Ti alloy certification packages. Of these  certification packages, 120 were found to contain suspicious omissions or other irregularities.  While the investigation primarily focused on assessing if there was evidence of an improperly  processed material, specifically regarding the cutting-down billet issue, the review indicated  there were also material lots that could not be traced back to the source. Also, this investigation  revealed that heat treatment, composition, and inspection could also be issues. Out of the dozens  of lots of Ti alloy associated with these irregular certification packages, residual material from 4  lots happened to exist in sufficient quantity to facilitate the fabrication of 121 (total) tensile test  coupons. The summary of tensile test results of Ti-6Al-4V materials in annealed condition from  four certification packages indicating possible improper processing is shown in table 4, JPL  Tensile Test Results Summary of Suspected Nonconforming Ti-6Al-4V in Annealed Condition.

The test data from these six coupons were combined with the 121 test  results listed in table 4, and the total set of test data was analyzed to determine a pseudo S-basis  minimum specification value (MSV) or knockdown, which could then be used in an on-going (at  the time of the nonconforming Ti alloy investigations only) Flight Projects schedule-critical Ti  alloy parts assessment process to determine if stress analyses yielded positive design margins for  specific spacecraft components. The resulting approximate S-basis MSVs are summarized in  table 5, JPL-Established Pseudo S-Basis Nonconforming Ti Alloy Minimum Specification  Values. This assessment process should not be used as a part of standard part design/test/analysis  processes for flight applications. This information is provided to indicate what one organization  did to assess flight load margins for existing schedule-critical flight hardware where there was  the possibility of having used a nonconforming Ti alloy lot.

The person who performed the  review is an expert in statistical treatment of materials property data.

A useful  test of the integrity of the manufacturing process is to establish the chain of custody of the  material through the various stages of processing, as discussed in section 6.2 in this NASA  Technical Handbook. The absence of information in certificates about who hot worked the  product to final dimensions and what lot number is associated with the hot-working operation  seems to have increased in recent years.  respectively. These knockdown property values were used to assess whether there was still  positive stress margin for affected JPL flight parts.   he threat of nonconforming Ti alloys being used on one of many dozens of flight projects at  JPL resulted in an exhaustive component-by-component assessment in the late 2000s. Based on  the new pseudo S-basis mechanical properties established in testing (described in section 5.2.3  above) and detailed reviews of respective materials certifications, a disposition of use-as-is,  retest, or remanufacture was made on over 1,000 parts already fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V. These  were in-process parts for which the launch had not yet occurred. For a further description of this  nonstandard and temporary effort used to screen Ti alloy parts for in-process projects, refer to  Appendix C in this NASA Technical Handbook. This type of screening is not recommended as  standard practice.  ppendix D in this NASA Technical Handbook contains specific examples of four irregular  certification packages and a description of typical missing information that is either required by  the specification or expected in accordance with industry standard practice, as well as  information not in conformance with referenced specifications.    An example of a \u201cclean,\u201d i.e., acceptable, Certification Package is provided in Appendix E in this  NASA Technical Handbook.     Based on a thorough investigation of the quality of both certification documentation and the  supply chain for aerospace-grade Ti alloy material, some mitigation actions have been identified  to help avoid the chances of procuring and using nonconforming material. Some or all of these  steps and even more conservative steps can be implemented to help prevent nonconforming  material from finding its way into NASA\u2019s and its contractors\u2019 flight hardware. These measures             nonconforming material was judged to reside primarily with metal distributors. There has been  no indication of improper Ti alloy processing on the part of mills or conversion houses.  Independent testing laboratories have been known to be under pressure at times from customers  on such issues as test sample location selection and discarding of samples that have failed to  meet specification minimums. Since procurements from metal distributors have grown, the  mitigation efforts noted in this section are directed toward assuring that, when material is  procured from distributors, the buyer can be assured that it meets all requirements.    can help secure high-quality Ti alloy raw material, as well as Ti alloy components supplied  through subcontracted manufacturers and industry partners.   n important aspect of determining whether final product forms may be nonconforming involves  careful inspection of the associated certification data package. Most metal suppliers will provide  an electronic or faxed copy of the applicable, lot-specific certification package(s) before the  procurement is placed with them. This affords an opportunity to avoid rejecting any lot of  material after it shows up at the place of use.   the material through the various stages of processing to determine whether each stage was  performed by a firm having the necessary processing capability. For example, if a final product  form of plate is produced from an intermediate product form of larger thickness, additional  rolling of the intermediate form is required. If the supplier is known not to have rolling  capability, which is the case for most Ti alloy distributors, and if there is no indication that the  material was rolled by a conversion house or other facility, then one should be suspicious that the  final product may be cut-down billet.  etailed knowledge of the certification requirements associated with the various specifications,  coupled with careful review of the certification data package, including verification of claimed  chemical composition, is needed to help assure that material has been properly processed and  certified.  Mechanical Inspection, and Acquisition can all help mitigate the potential risk of procuring and  using nonconforming Ti alloys. Because of the options and conditions necessary for Ti alloys to  be compliant with a given specification, the use of appropriately trained/experienced M&P  engineers and/or QA personnel is recommended for review and acceptance of Ti alloys for flight  applications.                 upply chain surveys and audits are recommended to be performed by QA or equivalent and  M&P engineers. An example survey/audit list is shown in Appendix F in this NASA Technical  Handbook. Qualified suppliers can be placed on a Qualified Suppliers List (QSL)/Approved  Suppliers List (ASL) at JPL. An organization can then establish an internal practice that  aerospace-quality wrought Ti alloys to be used for flight application should be procured only  from QSL/ASL suppliers. Frequency of re-audits may be dependent on performance factors.  Note: The same guideline procedures described in this NASA Technical Handbook should be  used for foreign Ti alloy sources and foreign contractors.  nsure that quality clauses regarding material are sufficiently spelled out to assure that mill  certifications, processing certifications, and testing certifications are received with material or  procured metal parts.   NASA Technical Handbook, requires mill certifications, processing certifications, and  independent material testing reports for any material that has been altered subsequent to mill  processing. Mills should provide the original material test report to purchasing organizations.  Original mill material purchasing organizations who, in turn, sell portions of any given mill lot  of material are expected to provide a copy of the original mill material test report to subsequent  purchasers.    ll procurements should require the material type and specifications to be listed on the contract,  e.g., Ti-6Al-4V annealed bar in accordance with SAE AMS6931 and Ti-6Al-4V annealed plate  in accordance with SAE AMS4911.  ach drawing should require that the material type and specification are identified, e.g., Ti-6Al-  4V annealed bar in accordance with SAE AMS6931 for the Isolator of Feed Assembly drawing.   review of certifications by M&P engineers and/or trained/experienced QA or equivalent  personnel.            certification package are. Variations have occurred between outside test laboratory report results  for mechanical testing, as provided with supplied material certification packages, and internal  post-material delivery testing.     assessment, a detailed evaluation of mechanical test report values was conducted between values  reported in the certificate package and values from internal tests at JPL. The 24 test coupons  created 96 data points of mechanical test data for tensile ultimate, tensile yield, percent  elongation, and percent reduction of area. Out of the total 96 data points, 93 in-house test values  were less than any of the independent test laboratory reported values. The independent test lab  provided two test values for each mechanical property, i.e. eight total test values. For a detailed  comparison of the two sets of mechanical property values, see Appendix H in this NASA  Technical Handbook.   perform additional independent spot-check material testing to compare selected supplier\u2019s  material test reports. The independent testing laboratory should be certified for specific testing,  such as mechanical testing, chemical analysis, nondestructive evaluation (NDE), etc., by the  National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap) or ISO in  accordance with AS9100, Aerospace Standard: Quality Management Systems - Requirements for  Aviation, Space and Defense Organizations. The Nadcap or ISO certification does not guarantee  accurate results; therefore, it is recommended that, along with looking for this certification, the  Center perform an audit of the testing house to ensure compliance with the test standards or  specifications and follow up with test laboratories that have demonstrated test result deviations  of concern.  nother potential issue is material test reports that contain typical or average test values rather  than actual test values. When the material specification requires quantitative limits for chemical,  mechanical, or physical properties, the test report should contain the actual test and/or inspection  values obtained. Certificates for physical properties should show actual values.  nonconforming material. The enhancements are in the vein of industry best practices and offer  the greatest amount of protection for the least cost.          n addition to the acquisition organization\u2019s role in utilizing the revised approach for the  procurement of raw metal, it is recommended to use the same requirements when acquiring  machined/fabricated items when the supplier is responsible for acquiring the raw material to be  used. This requires an approach similar to that used for raw material, i.e., the ASL process, to  assure conforming materials are acquired and used for these part or multiple part/assembly-level  procurements. The same material requirements and specifications, mill/processing certifications,  and test reporting and review are as needed for raw metal. This can be accomplished by  incorporation of the already described quality clause entitled Raw Material Traceability.   different approach may be needed, since these efforts may not be controlled through the  procuring organization\u2019s QA and/or M&P Engineering organizations. One approach can be to  establish standard Subcontract Data Requirements Lists (SDRLs)/Data Requirement  Descriptions (DRDs), that an organization\u2019s contracting personnel can use. This would provide  the QA/M&P Engineering organizations standards to be used for these subcontracts and may be  tailored, with appropriate document-owner approval. Included in this set of DRDs is the  Hardware End Item Data Package DRD in which the applicable material certification  requirements are contained. In addition to using the recommended language contained in the  standard SDRLs/DRDs, it is important that the institutional Mission Assurance organization  support and verify that the appropriate requirements are included in these subcontracts.  Examples of recommended language for such SDRLs/DRDs are:     \uf0b7 When a contractor supplies converted material produced by a raw material manufacturer,  the contractor shall submit all pre- and post-conversion chemical/physical tests reports  and any contractor arranged retests.

Titanium and titanium alloys supplied to DoD and NASA contracts must conform to all  contract requirements, including specifications cited in such contracts. When rolled plate  is specified, the titanium material must be rolled to the required thickness using industry  standard practices. When bar is specified, the titanium material must be hot worked to the  required dimensions. The required titanium material dimensions must not be  accomplished by cutting down a thicker material. Forged material must not be substituted  for rolled material requirements. Rolled material must not be substituted for forged  material requirements.   unacceptable product substitution under a government contract when the controlling  specification does not allow it.  . The superseding indictment referenced in the October 5, 2009, issuance of AAN-U-10-  005 was filed in the U.S. District Court, southern district of California, in criminal case  no. 08-cr4229-JLS. A second superseding indictment dated February 23, 2010, was also  filed in this case.         SCREENING OF TI ALLOY PARTS  FOR IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AT JPL    used, material distributor, heat number, mill source, mill product size, mill certification, lot  number, name of conversion house, certification of conversion processing, billet or starting  material size, final product size, final product condition, mechanical test report, nondestructive  testing certification, heat-treatment certification, and more.     Additionally, a method was developed to assess the risk of components with suspect or  incomplete certification paper. Ultimately, each Ti alloy component was reviewed by an M&P  Engineering specialist and assigned a category number, as described below:        he Ti part identification triggered a review of material certifications if a suspect source was  observed in the certification trail. Then, an emphasis was placed on obtaining a full certification  package for review by M&P Engineering.                             Suspect source material conditions that triggered a \u201csuspect certification/suspect material rating\u201d  were:    \u2212 Test methods used to generate data.  \u2212 What standards were used.  \u2212 Test laboratories/certifications.  \u2212 Mill certification/source.  \u2212 Heat treatment/thermal processing information.  \u2212 Properties indicate on certificate that they do not meet specification requirements.  however, the certificate should contain information to determine if material was bar or  billet.   \u2212 Mill-only certified ingot chemistry was provided with final product.  \u2212 Lacks conclusive evidence of adequate hot working.     specification requirements were satisfied; however, supplied material was cut from  billet that exceeded allowable cross-sectional area of 309.68 cm2 (48 in2).                                  Justification: Producing Ti alloy plate, sheet, or strip material in thicknesses less than  or equal to 4.8 mm (0.188 in) for multi-square feet of product via machining billet  stock material is considered more challenging (potato chip effect) and costly and,  therefore, highly unlikely to be used by suppliers, than typically used sheet  production techniques, i.e., rolling operations, used in industry.    \u2212 Producing Ti alloy wire form in diameters less than or equal to 7.9 mm (0.312 in)  in any reasonable lengths (multi-meters) via machining of Ti alloy billet stock  material is considered more challenging and costly, hence, highly unlikely to have  been used by suppliers, than typically used wire drawing operations used in  industry.   material to be thermo-mechanically processed, i.e., drawn through smaller and  smaller dies, interspersed with annealing operations, to create required wire gage  (diameter) product form.   procurement specifications, e.g., NAS 4004, Fastener, 6AL-4V Titanium Alloy,  Externally Threaded, 160 ksi Ftu, 95 ksi Fsu, 450 \u00b0F, for inch fasteners and NAS  NA0007, Procurement Specification Metric Fasteners, Titanium Alloy, Externally  Threaded, 1100 MPa Tensile, 660 MPa Shear, for metric fasteners, via machining  Ti alloy billet material are considered too high to be credible.

The NASA Technical Specification is a guide for design engineers to develop more  detailed requirements for specific pyrovalve applications. Adherence to these requirements will  reliably prevent NC parent metal valve leakage or other failure-induced release of hazardous  fluids (liquids or gases) from NASA payloads on Expendable Launch Vehicles (ELVs). This  NASA Technical Specification does not address NC parent metal valve sizing, pressure drop,  and other requirements.  programmatic documentation to ensure valves meet structural requirements and are considered to  be equivalent to other hazardous fluids pressure components such as tubing, tanks, and fittings,  and that any mode of external or internal leakage of the contained hazardous fluid is extremely  improbable (3 \u00d7 10-5) in accordance with NASA-STD-8719.24, NASA Expendable Launch  Vehicle Payload Safety Requirements, and AFSPCMAN 91-710, Air Force Space Command  Range Safety User Requirements Manual, or equivalent document for the applicable range.  ppendix A of this NASA Technical Specification presents a checklist of documents to be  prepared for NASA and/or Range Safety. The checklist is provided for manufacturers of NC  pyrovalves used in personnel hazardous applications. It is a tool for documenting the detailed  compliance to the intent of the safety specification. The checklist also provides an aid for  payload safety, Range Safety engineers, and other subject matter experts in reviewing the  documentation. Letter designations after the checklist item number refer to the following  requirement sources:                           For the purposes of this NASA Technical Specification, hazardous valve applications involve  hazardous flight hardware pressure systems as defined by NASA-STD-8719.24 and  AFSPCMAN 91-710, Volume 3, Chapter 12, Section 12.1.     as well as to valves that use a different means of applying force, e.g., memory shape alloys to  break out a section of a parent metal section allowing flow. The parent metal shear sections and  interface tubes are defined by the term \u201cparent metal\u201d when they are machined from a single,  certified bar of high-purity metal alloy with no welds.  This NASA Technical Specification is intended to be applied when these NC parent metal shear-  section valves are used to prevent failure-induced release of hazardous fluids (liquid or gas) from  spacecraft. It is primarily applicable to ELV payloads subject to NASA Payload Safety and  United States Air Force (USAF) Range Safety Requirements, where a consistently high level of  reliability and safety is required.  his NASA Technical Specification is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers and Facilities, and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program,  and other Agency documents. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally  Funded Research and Development Center [FFRDC]), other contractors, recipients of grants and  cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the extent specified or  referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.  erifiable requirement statements are designated by the acronym NCPR (Normally Closed  Pryovalves Requirement), numbered, and indicated by the word \u201cshall\u201d; this NASA Technical  Specification contains 80 requirements.

They also consume less electrical  power. They are single-use devices that are used in propulsion systems to isolate propellants or  pressurant gases. These fluids may be hazardous because of their toxicity, reactivity, temperature,  or high pressure.                  ote that in the simplified block diagram below not all detail features are shown so that those of  major interest are more prominent. The diagram is provided to point out the various features that  are discussed in this NASA Technical Specification. Features of some NC parent metal valve  designs may differ.   In 2013, NESC concluded an extensive study of the reliability and safety of NC parent metal  valves used in payloads carried aboard ELVs. The assessment successfully evaluated technical data  to determine the risk of NC parent metal valve leakage or inadvertent activation in ELV payloads. The  study resulted in numerous recommendations to ensure personnel and hardware/facility safety  during ground processing of ELV payloads. One of those recommendations was to establish a  NASA specification for NC parent metal valves.

(initiators), the basic valve requirements can be applied to valves actuated by mechanical,  electrical, hydraulic, and pneumatic or a combination of means. Whatever actuation method is  chosen, the maximum no-fire energy should be known to a reliability of 0.995 at a 95-percent  confidence level so that a factor of safety can be determined from all inadvertent sources of that  energy (checklist item 2D).    .2.3  electromagnetic interference.   .2.5  Fire and All-Fire requirements.  he No-Fire requirement is a minimum of 1 amp and 1 W applied for 5 min at a reliability of  99.9 percent and confidence level of 95 percent.

[NCPR 17] Each valve lot shall be qualified by meeting burst pressure test  requirements in accordance with section 4.3.1 in this NASA Technical Specification.          compliance with NASA-STD-5019 (see section 4.1 of this NASA Technical Specification),  growth of the maximum credible crack size shall be demonstrated to the fracture control  authority to be non-credible, based on knowledge of quality control and manufacturing  techniques used to make the NC parent metal valve.      metal barriers to the flow before valve actuation, this capability shall be verified by proof testing  at 1.5xMEOP, independently applied to each parent metal shear-section and then externally to                          b. [NCPR 28] All NC parent metal valves shall meet a minimum design burst pressure  of 2.5xMEOP for lines with diameters \u22653.8 cm (\u22651.5 in) or 4.0xMEOP for lines with diameters  <3.8 cm (<1.5 in).    2) [NCPR 30] Testing shall be performed before and after actuation and on a sample  of the units that have successfully functioned after destructive acceptance testing  (checklist items 8AD and 33D).  C parent metal used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage may be  required by USAF Range Safety and NASA Payload Safety to have a minimum design burst  pressure requirement of 4.0 times maximum ground working pressure (MGWP). NC parent  metal valves used in hazardous systems without additional barriers to leakage are considered  Category A ordnance devices and have to follow NASA-STD 8719.24 and AFSPCMAN 91-710,  Volume 3, Chapter 13, or equivalent document for applicable range. This requirement should be  identified and documented early in the launch facility coordination process and be documented  in the tailoring agreement. This requirement would not apply to Category B ordnance pyrovalve  applications, which are, by definition, non-hazardous.       the shear-section when welded in the housing, with no evidence of permanent deformation or  leakage during LAT.                       Other shear-section barriers such as a metal-to-metal seal, elastomeric seats, or O-rings do not  provide the same level of confidence and do not meet the intent of this NASA Technical  Specification (checklist item 9A).     upon actuation of the valve. The shear-section normally has flanges larger than the shear-  section outer diameter that are welded to the valve housing to prevent leakage after actuation.  When installed in the system, the parent metal sections are directly welded to the system tubing  (checklist item 9A).     lthough many materials can be considered for the parent metal shear-section, the use of  vacuum furnace remelt 304L stainless steel has a significant legacy for the shear-section  application (checklist item 13D). (The L on 304L indicates extra-low-carbon stainless steel.)  Other metals may require heat treatment after welding, as judged necessary by the responsible  NASA materials specialist (checklist item 15D). The yield and tensile strength callouts may vary  depending on the strength requirements. The standard yield and tensile strength may be used if  they will meet the stress/force analysis requirements.       fatigue properties; low stress corrosion cracking; high elongation; and toughness  at cryogenic, ambient, and high temperatures (checklist item 14D), if applicable.    3) [NCPR 39] The parent metal shear-section and any other parts wetted by the  fluids and/or combustion products shall be constructed of a metal or other  material that is compatible with the fluids and/or combustion products.  The NASA Materials and Processes Technical Information System II (MAPTIS II),  a single-point source for materials properties for NASA and NASA-associated                  contractors and organizations, contains physical, mechanical, and environmental  properties for metallic and non-metallic materials.2 Other relevant resources for  materials properties are NASA-STD-6016, Standard Materials and Processes  Requirements for Spacecraft, AIAA SP-084-1999, Special Report: Fire,  Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety Hazards of Hypergols \u2013 Hydrazine; AIAA  SP-085-1999, Special Report: Fire, Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety  Hazards of Hypergols \u2013 Monomethylhydrazine; and AIAA SP-086-2001, Special  Report: Fire, Explosion, Compatibility, and Safety Hazards of Nitrogen  Tetroxide (checklist item 16D).  he parent metal shear-section may have stringers. Investigations have shown  that the stringers that may occur in 304L are usually approximately 0.00127 cm  (0.0005 in) in diameter and that the stringer material is not attacked by common  fuels and oxidizers over a period of several years. Even if the stringers are  oriented perpendicular to any thin break section, the chances of a leak from  stringers are remote. However, a commonly used dye-penetrant etchant (a  solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid) has been shown to dissolve stringer  material in 304L stainless steel. The solution attacks the material in the stringer  and can cause leaks in thin sections. This solution should be avoided on any part  of the valves (checklist item 17D). Note that for 304L stainless steel, any  significant stringer is screened out during the required proof and helium leak  testing process.  he use of vacuum remelt raw material significantly reduces the likelihood of  stringers occurring. Materials used in fracture-sensitive regions of the shear-  section valve should be derived from alloy production processes that implement  modern alloy remelting control practices, e.g., electroslag remelting, vacuum arc  remelting, or vacuum induction melting, which serve to enhance alloy  homogeneity, purity, and metallurgical soundness and reduce the potential for  undesirable secondary inclusion phases that can have a detrimental effect on  mechanical properties, fracture toughness, and pitting corrosion.      hazardous fluids after actuation, e.g., rams, plugs, seals, shall also have the same requirements  for materials compatibility with the hazardous fluids and the same welding compatibility  requirements (checklist item 18D).                Before firing, a leak in the upstream-side parent metal seal could allow hazardous fluid at  system pressure to enter the ram area. Similarly, after firing, leakage past the ram might occur.  In either case, hazardous fluid could enter the ram area. Therefore, to ensure at least single-fault  tolerance against external leakage, all internal valve materials that could then become wetted  are to be fully compatible with the hazardous fluid.  pecific mission requirements may drive other requirements that are not covered by this NASA  Technical Specification. For example, some applications require that the valve be in the system  and pressurized for many years with corrosive propellants after it operates, causing stress  corrosion or metal nitrate formation.   section design. This design is generally considered to contain two inhibits to flow and is the  preferred design approach.     Figure 3, Dual One-Piece Parent Metal Shear-Section Valve, is a design generally considered to  contain two independent barriers to flow (upstream and downstream \u201cV\u201d cut ligaments), but  additional NDE and/or analysis may be required to show that the single piece either does not  contain defects that may grow to leakage or that failure is not credible (extremely unlikely)  during ground processing operations. Both designs, when qualified, can be acceptable for use in  ELV payload hazardous flight applications (checklist item 20A).                             arent metal shear-section valves used in single isolation configurations (without additional  inhibits) need additional inspection and rigorous analysis to ensure the high unlikelihood that  critical flaws exist.   4.6.2  controlled storage as part of process control.  .6.3  [NCPR 47] For single isolation valves, a suitable and representative sample shall be  removed from the middle or ends of each bar and submitted to an accredited laboratory for  analysis.   nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid to remove 0.000762 to 0.00127 cm (0.0003 to 0.0005 in) from  the surface.     .6.1  manufacturing lot basis (checklist item 20A).                  .6.4  using the same tooling and machine setup for each lot of shear-sections (checklist item 24D).  hear-sections should be cleaned using the standard documented cleaning process for the  material (checklist item 24D).   .6.5  as specified by a cognizant materials and process authority (checklist item 25D).  . [NCPR 56] If applicable, the \u201cV\u201d notch angle, depth, and tip radius shall be measured  by optical comparator or equivalent and verified to fully meet drawing requirements and indicate  measured tip radius (checklist item 27D).    t is also recommended that the actual radius be documented to within measurement system  accuracy (within \u00b10.000635 cm (\u00b10.00025 in), traceable to a national standard). This will  facilitate valve analysis, if required.  a. [NCPR 55] Shear-section dimensions that are critical for containment of hazardous  fluids shall be 100 percent inspected and recorded for each shear-section (checklist item 26D).     .6.7  parent metal barrier conforms to the minimum thickness required by the design drawing  (checklist item 28AD).   established by NDE, proof testing, or process control if the valve does not meet or exceed a  demonstrated safety factor of 1.5.                    This NASA Technical Specification requires that the valve meet a demonstrated safety factor of  2.5 to 4.0, as applicable.   ye penetrants are generally used on flat surfaces (not in sharp groves), are not recommended,  and should not be used unless a well-documented probability of detection (POD) study has been  conducted to prove that the POD is greater than 90 percent with 95 percent confidence (termed  90/95 POD). Eddy current scanners with \u201cV\u201d-shaped sensor ends that ride in the groves are  commonly used for other similar applications such as detecting cracks in critical bolt threads,  and could be considered for this application as long as the technique has been fully validated.  Questions regarding validation should be addressed to the NASA NDE Technical Fellow.  .6.9  [NCPR 62] Etchant limitations: an etchant solution of nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid or  other similar solutions that may dissolve stringers shall not be used internally or externally on the  parent metal shear-section.  .6.10 [NCPR 63] Valves shall be serialized and records of assembly production and inspection  steps kept by serial number (checklist item 29D).   a. [NCPR 65] Welding shall be done on a weld lot basis using the same weld schedule  and weld instructions for a specific weld and be done in a way that minimizes or eliminates \u201cV\u201d  notch residual weld stress (checklist item 30D).     .6.12 [NCPR 67] Although the pyrotechnic devices used to power the valve are specified by  the program, they shall be made and tested from the same lot (checklist item 31D).  NCPR 68] All manufacturing and inspection records and tested units shall be retained by the  manufacturer for a minimum of 10 years, unless otherwise specified by contract (checklist item  36D).                   NCPR 70] The non-destructive 100-percent acceptance testing shall be performed in accordance  with the product procurement specification (checklist item 34D), where required.

The checklist assists in documenting the detailed compliance to the intent of the  safety specification.

As valves subject to this NASA Technical Specification have to  have a safety factor of at least 2.5, analysis is not generally required for shear valves unless there  is measurable deformation.   NCPR 80] When NC parent metal valve analysis is required, either before manufacturing or in  the event that proper documentation has not been maintained, the analysis and evaluation process  shall include the following:      minimum material strength from the current literature, from the manufacturer\u2019s specifications, or  from actual raw material analyses.        epending on the stress levels, non-linear analysis may also be required.

[EBR 29] To distribute the current around the vehicle and minimize the currents near  possible entry points into the vehicle and near critical areas and systems (including pyrotechnic  systems, rocket motors, fuel handling and storage areas, antennas, electronic equipment, and  signal and power cables), multiple low impedance paths shall be incorporated across and through  vehicle outer mold line and structural components.  b.

A mechanically secure electrical bond path is a continuous bond path that maintains the default  dc resistance (or lower) after exposure to shock, vibration, launch loads, and other expected  mechanical movement.  A limit of 1.0 ohm is used as a requirement because it is easily obtained with good contact  between conductive surfaces. Static charges can usually be dissipated through less conductive  connections.  igher dc resistance values acceptable for Class S electrical bonds may be determined  through performance of a detailed analysis to determine the amount of stored energy on  the item to be bonded as a function of the proposed electrical bond resistance.   electrical bonds, the stored energy determined by the analysis shall be less than applicable hazard  threshold levels for personnel shock, equipment upset, flammable materials, gases, or vapors, or  electro-explosive device (EED) ignition for approval of the proposed electrical bond resistance.

The metal-to-metal method may not be feasible, and the bonding strap or  fastener method may be the best bonding alternative for the application.    the mated surfaces into one piece of metal, such as by welding or brazing, are considered  permanent and inherently bonded.   have their faying surfaces prepared prior to assembly in accordance with paragraph 5.2 to ensure  a good electrical bond.   accordance with applicable mechanical engineering assembly and installation  requirements.

Extra care should be utilized in the attachment of the ends of bonding straps to prevent arcing or  other means of electrical noise generation with movements of the strap.            (2) [EBR 71] The cross-sectional area of any individual jumper shall not be less than  number 12 American Wire Gauge (AWG) wire (6530 circular mils) for stranded  copper, and not less than number 10 AWG wire (10,380 circular mils) for  stranded aluminum.    (3) [EBR 72] Where the jumper is subject to arcing, a minimum of number 7 AWG  (20,820 circular mils) for copper or number 5 AWG (33,100 circular mils) for  aluminum for each jumper shall apply.                                 f the bond application is approved by the procuring agency, fasteners (e.g., bolts, nuts, or studs)  may be used to meet bonding requirements. Fasteners should be primarily used to maintain  pressure on faying surfaces. However, in some cases fasteners may perform better than straps  for Class L and R applications. The inductance of multiple bolts between otherwise isolated  materials may be less than the inductance of a strap between surfaces.   performed showing that the number of bolts used in the path is sufficient to provide a low  impedance path.        . [EBR 78] For Class L applications, multiple rivets, bolts, or other fasteners shall be  used at joints in vehicle skin and structure to ensure multiple metallic contact areas capable of  sharing lightning current.

Non-hardening sealant or thermal grease may be applied to the faying surfaces of semi-  permanent joints if tests indicate bonding requirements can be met after assembly.   If the bond is permanent, a hardening sealant, such as chromated epoxy primer, may be used if  tests indicate bonding requirements can be met after assembly.     impairs the effectiveness of any electrical bond and weakens the structure in which it occurs.  When choosing materials for a given electrical bonding application, major factors that  contribute to corrosion are the degree of separation of metals in the galvanic series and the  amount of moisture present.       mating surfaces to expose the graphite layer. Electrical bonds between CFRP sheets can be  made by overlapping exposed graphite on both sheets. Conductive epoxy may also be placed on  the exposed graphite, and bonding connections may be made to metallic surfaces through the  conductive epoxy.   arbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) provides some conductivity through the graphite  filaments. However, the graphite is usually covered with nonconductive epoxy or phenolic  material.                           ome requirements should be verified at the equipment level, such as bonding of equipment  assembly interfaces and connector backshell contacts.   measurement may be an option. Controls need to be implemented in shield termination paths  through connector assemblies. A realistic value would be on the order of 10 milliohms from the  shield to the electronics enclosure for a cadmium-plated aluminum assembly, with 2.5 milliohms  maximum for any particular joint.            .

An example of electrical bonding for more than one purpose would be  a piece of electronic equipment powered from the system power supply. It would require Class R  bonding for RF and Class H bonding for fault current protection. Since both classes are  applicable, the bond should be low inductance with no more than 2.5 milliohms dc resistance for  Class R, and the contact area should be adequate to carry the maximum fault current that could  occur for Class H.  A nose cone should meet the lightning and static charge requirements. The Class L requirement  calls for low inductance, low resistance, and adequate area to carry lightning current. Since the  bond requirement for static charge is only moderately low resistance, the lightning bond will be  sufficient for both.  he only requirement for conductive tubing carrying fluid will be to meet the Class S  requirement. An electrical bond to basic structure of 1.0 ohm or less will be adequate.    ee paragraph 4.1.2 for applicable requirements. A dedicated power return is preferred over the  use of structure for power current return and will be stated as a requirement for most programs.  However, structure return is occasionally used for some systems such as small satellites.  n those cases where structure current is used, the voltage drop allowed divided by the maximum  current that may be delivered by the power supply will give the total resistance allowed in the  circuit. This total resistance includes the wire, its connectors, and all Class C electrical bond  joints in the structure return path. The resistance limit for each Class C electrical bond joint can  then be determined by subtracting the resistance of the wire and interconnections from the total  resistance, and dividing the remaining value by the number of Class C electrical bond joints in  the path.  between a power wire and a metallic equipment case or other conductive structure, should return  through structure and the joints in the structure to its source. Circuit protection devices are  intended to limit the duration of fault current events to prevent a significant temperature increase  in the circuit wiring. Typically, the fault current is considerably higher than the fuse or breaker  value, and it trips the device quickly. However, a circuit breaker can sometimes take several  seconds to trip with a current twice its rating. Resistance across all the joints in the return path  should be low enough to allow enough current to trip circuit protection devices in a timely  manner.                SAE-ARP-1870, Aerospace Systems Electrical Bonding and Grounding for Electromagnetic  Compatibility and Safety, restricts voltages on electronic equipment cases to less than 4.5 volts  and requires no fire or damage to the bond in the event of a short to case.  or shock protection from voltages exceeding 30 volts, MIL-HDBK-274, Military Handbook:  Electrical Grounding for Aircraft Safety, recommends a circuit breaker break time of 0.2 second.  tructural material that is not highly conductive, such as glass or graphite fiber reinforced plastic  (GFRP), may increase the path resistance enough to delay or prevent tripping the circuit breaker.  In addition to being a shock hazard, fault current can cause ignition of graphite epoxy material.   inductance of the strap is not a concern for fault current since the high current will be from a dc  or low frequency alternating current (ac) power source. Inductance will be a concern if the strap  conducts RF or lightning current.     equipment, but it is difficult to determine in advance which equipment really needs to be well  bonded. The low impedance to structure is necessary for certain power line to equipment chassis  filters and for proper operation of cable shields terminated to equipment chassis. Isolated  structural elements with linear dimensions approaching 1/4 wavelength, can pick up and re-  radiate RF from high power transmitters or develop enough voltage to produce a glow discharge  or arcing to other elements. This should be taken into account when sizing the length of straps or  jumpers used for Class R bonds, as such elements themselves can become a significant source of  interference under conditions described above.   metal-to-metal contact that can be expected to be consistent. The basic requirement is to have  low impedance at the frequency or frequencies of interest. The value of this impedance depends  upon the quality of the surface preparation (e.g., the chemical formulation used for the  conversion coating, and the thickness thereof), the area of the faying surfaces in contact, and the  amount of pressure holding the surfaces together. The impedance of an acceptable bond may be  in the ohms range for RF even though the dc resistance is less than 2.5 milliohms. The resistance  is overshadowed by the inductive reactance of the configuration.   reactance greater than 2.5 milliohms at frequencies above 10 megahertz (MHz). RF bonds may be  satisfactory with several ohms of impedance; but, when straps are used, even these levels will be  quickly exceeded as frequency increases. If the use of bond straps for RF bonds is unavoidable,  strap length should always be limited to a length to width ratio of 5 to 1.  onopole or half-loop antennas mounted on composite outer mold line surfaces should be  provided with circular or elliptical groundplanes or counterpoises 1/4 wavelength in radii over  the operating frequency range of the antenna, and should be installed with a low impedance         return path to vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance no greater than 2.5 milliohms, so that  antenna fields are not attenuated by poorly conductive composite material. Antennas mounted on  composite outer mold line surfaces that do not require local groundplanes or counterpoises but  that otherwise require a low impedance path to the vehicle structure for proper operation, should  be installed with a low impedance return path to the vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance  no greater than 2.5 milliohms. Antennas of all types, mounted on metallic outer mold line  surfaces, that require a low impedance path to the mounting surface for proper operation, should  provide a return path to vehicle structure that exhibits a dc resistance no greater than 2.5  milliohms.  he 2.5-milliohm dc resistance requirement is good for a standard, but one should not assume a  good RF bond exists just because the dc resistance is less than 2.5 milliohms. Also, extra effort  need not be made just to satisfy the dc requirement if the RF impedance is much higher due to  the inductance of the configuration. Look at the whole configuration to get the lowest impedance  possible at the frequencies of interest to produce a good RF bond.  he electrical bond path between an electronic box and the structure has a complex equivalent  circuit that may be simplified to a resistance in series with an inductance all in parallel with a  capacitance. The equivalent resistance includes the resistance of any bond strap present plus the  resistance of the joints in the path. At higher frequencies, where the diameter or thickness of the  strap significantly exceeds the skin depth, the ac resistance becomes larger than the dc resistance.  The ac resistance increases with the square root of frequency.  he inductance is directly proportional to the length of the bond path, but is also a function of  width and thickness. Multiple paths can reduce the inductance value by introducing additional  parallel current paths. The magnitude of inductive reactance increases 20 dB with every decade  of frequency increase.   he total impedance across the joint is equal to the resistance at frequencies from dc to the point  where the inductive reactance approaches the resistance. The impedance due to inductance then  increases at 20 dB per decade of frequency to a frequency where the inductive reactance and the  capacitive reactance are equal. At this parallel resonant frequency, the impedance may rise to  thousands of ohms depending on the ratio of reactance to resistance (Q) in the circuit. The Q is  high when the resistance is low, which is usually the case for a bonding joint. At frequencies  above this point, the capacitive reactance is less than the inductive reactance; and the total  impedance begins to come back down. Often there are more complex series and parallel  resonances; and, at the higher frequencies, the impedance may vary considerably.  inversely proportional to the distance between the box and the structure. The magnitude of  capacitive reactance decreases 20 dB per decade of frequency increase.             For electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing, the equipment under test (EUT) bonding method  to the copper-top test table will be as close as practicable to the flight configuration (i.e., bond  strap, surface mating, etc.). Only the provisions included in the design of the equipment and  specified in the installation instructions will be used to bond units, such as equipment case and  mount, together or to the ground plane. If the EUT is secured to mounting bases, incorporating  shock or vibration isolators, such mounting bases will be used in the test configuration. Bonding  straps furnished with the mounting base will be connected to the ground plane. Where mounting  bases do not incorporate bonding straps, bonding straps will not be used in the test setup. If  installation conditions for the EUT are unknown, the EUT will not be grounded. Portable  equipment should be tested while bonded to the ground plane and also while not bonded to the  ground plane.   ee paragraph 4.1.5 for applicable requirements. Electrical bonding in itself does not ensure  lightning protection, but it is a major part of the overall plan. Lightning current usually enters  one extremity of the vehicle and exits at another extremity. Lightning current is high and  voltages developed across joints are high enough to arc and provide a path to some exit point. A  good current path should be provided around the outside of the vehicle to help protect internal  equipment. Electrical bonding helps provide the proper continuity for the path.  Even when a large current path is provided to carry the current, attach points across joints still  may present a problem. Arcing at joints can be expected even with good electrical bonds.  Lightning current waveforms, as defined in SAE-ARP-5412, have rates of rise of 1 x 1011  amps/second. Considering a bond connection with inductance of 0.1 \uf06dH would result in a  voltage spike across the joint of 10,000 volts. The arc produces an ionized path that helps carry  the current. The majority of the current can be kept external to the vehicle through good  electrical bonding of the vehicle skin.   resistance are kept as low as possible. The strap and connections should be robust enough to  survive the high lightning current and the magnetic forces resulting from high lightning current.  Straps should not have loops or bends greater than 45 degrees to avoid damage from magnetic  forces. Information concerning lightning bonds may be found in \u201cLightning Protection of  Aircraft\u201d by Lightning Technologies, Inc.  pertures should be kept as small as possible. Joints should be bonded in many places to prevent  long slots between bonds. Joints and apertures in the skin allow some voltage to be induced into  underlying cables. This voltage should be kept low enough to prevent disrupting electronic  equipment.  pecial care should be taken to route current around fuel or pyrotechnics to prevent arcs that  can ignite fuel or current that can fire pyrotechnics. Fuel and pyrotechnics should be completely  enclosed by a Faraday cage of conductive material bonded to structure to provide an adequate  margin against ignition. Wires to pyrotechnics should be shielded and the shields should have  360 degrees terminations to the metal enclosure.          lower charged object affects the rate of discharge for an item being charged. A low resistance  reduces the charge faster, but bonds with resistances that would be considered high, such as 10  kilohms to 100 kilohms, usually function adequately. The charging current, usually in  microamps, returning through the resistance to ground determines the voltage developed.  lectrostatic charges should be controlled and dissipated to avoid fuel ignition and ordnance  hazards, to protect personnel from shock hazards, and to prevent performance degradation or  damage to electronics. A requirement for 1.0 ohm or less to ground is a good requirement for  metal items because any good metal-to-metal connection will measure less than 1.0 ohm. Under  some circumstances, such as when semiconductive materials or complex configurations are used,  this limit may be increased. Metal straps or jumpers across joints are adequate since the current  is dc.  n arc discharge can cause direct effects to the item being discharged and to the item receiving  the discharge. Indirect effects may be caused by voltages induced into neighboring items. Direct  or indirect effects include physical damage to an item, upset of operation, ignition, or shock to  personnel.  ngineering guidelines and design practices to minimize the effects of spacecraft surface and  internal charging in space environments is given in NASA-HDBK-4002A, Mitigating In-Space  Charging Effects \u2013 A Guideline. It serves as a reference source that contains suggested detailed  spacecraft design requirements and procedures to minimize the effects of spacecraft charging and  to limit the effects of the resulting ESD. This Handbook is complementary to NASA-STD-4005,  Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Charging Design Standard, and NASA-HDBK-4006, Low Earth  Orbit Spacecraft Charging Design Handbook. NASA-STD-4005 and NASA-HDBK-4006  address Low Earth Orbit spacecraft charging at the auroral zones (attitude from 200 and 1000 km  and latitude between -50 and +50 degrees).  aunch service providers, such as the Eastern Test Range (ETR), may impose additional  requirements on the flight vehicles that launch from their range. The ETR levies a surface  conductivity requirement on flight vehicles to protect from triboelectrification effects. Air Force  specification, AFSPCMAN91-710V6, Range Safety User Requirements Manual Volume 6 \u2013  Ground and Launch Personnel, Equipment, Systems, and Material Operations Safety  Requirements, contains the following triboelectrification requirements:    \u201cA7.2.5.4.10. Triboelectrification. Do not launch if a vehicle has not been treated for  surface electrification and the flight path will go through any clouds above the \u201310 \u00b0C  level up to the altitude at which the vehicle\u2019s velocity exceeds 3,000 ft/sec. A vehicle is  considered \u201ctreated\u201d for surface electrification if:               \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.1. All surfaces of the vehicle susceptible to precipitation particle  impact have been treated to assure    \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.1.2. That all conductors on surface (including dielectric  surfaces that have been treated with conductive coatings) are bonded to  the vehicle by a resistance that is less than 105ohms;   \u201cA7.2.5.4.10.2. It has been shown by test or analysis that electrostatic discharges  (ESDs) on the surface of the vehicle caused by triboelectrification by ice particle  impact will not be hazardous to the launch vehicle or the mission. In  A7.2.5.4.10.1.1 above, the correct unit for surface resistivity is ohms/square. This  means that any square area of any size measured in any units has the same  resistance in ohms when the measurement is made from an electrode extending  the length of one side of the square to an electrode extending the length of the  opposite side of the square. The area-independence is literally valid only for  squares; it is not true for other shapes such as rectangles and circles.\u201d  In summary, bonding for electrostatic charge should use the 1.0-ohm requirement for ordinary  metal joints to ensure a good connection. The 1.0-ohm requirement simply ensures the metal-to-  metal bond is a clean, quality bond that will retain its conductivity. Good connections that  measure up to 100 kilohms from equipment to ground for unusual configurations or  semiconductive materials may be acceptable. Jumpers and straps may be used.     Two materials may be placed in direct contact if the electromotive force (EMF) difference  between their groups is not more than 0.25 volts. Where other dissimilar materials are placed in  contact, galvanic reaction may cause corrosion of the material that is higher (more anodic) in the  galvanic series. Corrosion impedes current flow and damages materials. When two materials  form a couple that is incompatible, the materials should be plated, coated, or otherwise protected  with a conductive finish compatible with each; or a material compatible with each should be  inserted between the two materials.  If the mating of dissimilar materials cannot be avoided, the most active of the materials should  be replaceable in reusable vehicles. In all applications the electrolyte contact area of the most  anodic materials, higher in series, should be larger than that of the cathodic materials. The larger                           the anodic area the lower the current density will be on more cathodic-materials. An approved  sealant should be used to seal all edges from moisture.    tubing provides a charging source. If the fluid is not conductive, it can carry charges to  conductive items in the fluid path. Conductive items in the fluid flow path should be bonded to  structure to prevent a static charge buildup.   Conductive hose or tubing grounded to structure will help prevent charging. Conductive fluids  can also prevent the charge separation. With a nonconductive fluid in nonconductive tubing, the  charge may transfer to conductive items in the line or, if enough potential develops, a discharge  may occur through an arc from the fluid through the tubing to a metal sheath or other conductive  items outside the tubing. This arc may produce small holes in the tubing.  Tubing is available that is somewhat conductive and prevents the separation and movement of  the charge if its resistivity is less than 1 megohm per meter of length. Fluids with volume  resistivity less than 107 ohm-meters are conductive enough to prevent the separation of charge,  but there is seldom a choice of fluids.    could be a problem. CFRP, or composite materials that contain metal particles, could be  conductive enough to drain off static charges if given a conductive path from the material to  metallic structure. See paragraph 5.4 for applicable CFRP requirements when using materials,  such as honeycomb graphite panels.   ince these composite materials are relatively poor conductors, they should not be used to carry  high current. The resistance would cause excessive voltage drop for intentional power return, and  short circuit current may be limited to levels too low to trigger circuit protection devices.  CFRP may be used as RF ground even though its dc resistance may exceed the usual Class R  limits. If the resistance through the composite structure can be kept to a few ohms, the total  impedance to RF will depend upon the inductance of the configuration just as it would with metal.  Special attention should be given to bonding across joints in composite materials. The graphite  layers are conductive, but epoxy, phenolic, isocyanate, polyimide, or other polymeric resin may  cover the surface of the composite. This nonconductive outer layer should be removed to expose  the graphite so conductive connections may be made at joints. If the bond is for RF purposes, do  not depend on narrow straps. The connection should be continuous along edges that have been  abraded to expose graphite. Connection may be made by overlapping panels or by adding a  conductive bridge secured by metal fasteners or by conductive adhesive across the joint.                   he conductive layers of multilayer insulation may be bonded together at several points using  accordion-shaped metal foil fitted into the edges of the conductive layers so that each conductive  layer contacts the foil. A rivet or bolt through the layers and the foil will assure contact and will  provide a point for attachment to structure. Good conductivity should be verified by test.   required nor desirable unless specifically noted by the procuring agency. Usually tests of certain  processes can verify that the process will result in a satisfactory bond. Other bonds using the  same process can be verified by similarity. Verification that the same process was used on each  bond should be adequate. Testing to verify resistance limits may be required depending upon the  criticality of the equipment and the purpose of the bond as determined by the specific project.  For example, all antenna installations and all electronic equipment may be required to be tested  for resistance to structure, but the low impedance and current carrying requirements will still be  verified by inspection and analysis.     resistance requirements. These processes should also be called out on fabrication drawings and  verified by quality.   bond required. For Class C, H, and L, the bond should have enough contact area to carry the  intentional, fault, or lightning current. Class L bonds should also be robust enough to withstand  the magnetic effects of the large current being carried, if they are to be useful for more than one  strike. These requirements are typically verified by analysis and inspection of the drawings and  the installation.   made to determine the impedance of any RF bond other than direct metal-to-metal contact over a  large surface area.  he effectiveness of a direct bond is dependent upon the clamping pressure. A maintenance  program should be put in place to verify these bonds still meet the requirements throughout the  life cycle of the system.  n short, bonding should be verified by analysis, some tests of actual bonds, and tests of samples  of a process, inspection of physical bonds and processes, and similarity to other good bonds. An  electrical bonding path diagram may aid in verification of the complete bonding path. An  example of a bonding path diagram is shown in figure 2, Electrical Bonding Path Diagram  Example. It is not required to use the same symbols or even the same structure.                             "

The purpose of this NASA Technical Standard is to provide a design standard for spacecraft  electrical power systems using voltages greater than 55 volts that operate in the low Earth orbit  (LEO) plasma environment encountered in altitudes up to 2000 kilometers (km) and latitudes  between -50 and +50 degrees. Such power systems, particularly solar arrays, are the proximate  cause of spacecraft charging in LEO; and these systems can interact with this environment in a  number of ways that are potentially destructive to themselves as well as to the platform or  vehicle that has deployed them.  High-voltage systems are used in space for two primary reasons. The first reason is to save  launch weight. For the same power level, higher voltages enable use of smaller diameter wires  (lighter cabling). This is true because P = IV, and V = IR, so P = I2R (where P is power, I is  current, R is resistance, and V is voltage). If I is decreased by use of higher V, then smaller  wires can be used with no increase in power loss due to cabling. Of course, if one uses the same  cable mass, higher voltages will enable higher efficiencies, since less power will be lost to  resistance in the cables. For very large power systems, the decrease in cable mass can be  substantial.  The second reason to use a high voltage power system is that some spacecraft functions require  them. For example, electric propulsion uses voltages from about 300 V (Hall thrusters) to about  1000 V (ion thrusters). A low-voltage power system would require conversion of substantial  power to high voltages for these spacecraft functions to operate. The weight of the power  conversion systems, power management and distribution (PMAD), can be a substantial fraction  of the total power system weight in these cases. It is more efficient, and can save weight, if the  high-voltage functions can be directly powered from a high-voltage solar array. If the high-  voltage function is electric propulsion, such a system is called a direct-drive electric propulsion  system.  Because of these and other reasons, spacecraft designers and manufacturers are increasingly  employing high voltage power systems, but with the advantages comes a higher risk of  spacecraft charging. The presence of high voltage solar arrays and exposed electrical  conductors that carry high voltages can directly exacerbate the spacecraft charging process in  LEO, potentially resulting in undesirable electrical arcing, power drain and disruptions, and  contamination of spacecraft surfaces and coatings all of which contribute to the damage and                      loss of spacecraft coatings. Thus, system designers need a standard to show them how to  mitigate the spacecraft charging effects of using high voltages in LEO. In addition to system  designers, this document is useful to space mission personnel including project managers, solar  array designers, and system engineers.      his NASA Technical Standard is applicable to spacecraft electrical power systems using  voltages greater than 55 volts that operate in the LEO plasma environment encountered in  altitudes up to 2000 kilometers (km) and latitudes between -50 and +50 degrees. Specifically  excluded are spacecraft that encounter GEO charging conditions that do not (often) encounter  energetic electrons within the auroral ovals, and that do not fly through the Van Allen belts. For  the extreme radiation protection that is necessary for orbits in the Van Allen belts, exterior  spacecraft charging and internal charging will be a concern. However, it is not in the  purview of this document to deal with those two topics. For direction on designing spacecraft to  survive the conditions in GEO and in the Van Allen belts, one should reference NASA-HDBK-  4002A, Mitigating In-Space Charging Effects-A Guideline.  spacecraft. For example, in GEO one would use materials on the external surface of the  spacecraft with low electrical resistance that are all bonded together. This prevents external  charging and the potential for electrostatic discharge. In LEO, if you make external materials  conductive, then more current is collected from the plasma increasing the parasitic currents in the  system and changing the system floating potential. If the spacecraft will fly in both LEO and  GEO conditions, be careful to use design solutions that are applicable in both environmental  regimes (see NASA-HDBK-4002A).

SCR 5] Spacecraft that operate a significant amount of time in LEO shall use arc prevention and  mitigation techniques appropriate for the LEO environment. The techniques used to prevent and  mitigate arcing in LEO are not the same as those used to mitigate GEO arcing. For design  guidelines to prevent spacecraft charging in GEO, use NASA-HDBK-4002A.    a. [SCR 6] Solar array or power system trigger arcs shall be prevented using one or  more of the following methods (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.2.4.2):  (1) Limit the potential of possible arc-sites to a voltage lower than the trigger arc  threshold (which shall be determined by testing). This task can be achieved by  one or more of the following:  interconnects (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.1) or closely  spaced coverslides (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.4.1).     4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen discharge  conditions).                                    avoid creating Paschen discharge conditions. Elimination can be achieved by one  or more of the following:        dimensions than the minimum Debye length expected in the LEO environment  (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3.1).  2) Limit the differential potentials of adjacent solar array strings, cells, or power  traces to below the sustained arcing threshold (which shall be determined by  testing). This task can be achieved by using power system string voltages lower    b. [SCR 8] Sustained solar array arcs shall be prevented with one or more of the  following (but see also NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section D.2.4.2):                                   than the sustained arcing voltage threshold and/or using string layouts that  prevent adjacent cells or strings from having large differential voltages.         [SCR 9] The arcing thresholds for geometries intended to mitigate  sustained arcing shall be determined by testing.  (4) Prevent trigger arc plasmas from initiating Paschen discharge at the differential  voltage between strings or cells. The Paschen minimum for most materials that  can be evolved during a trigger arc can only be determined by testing. Without  an extensive test program to determine these thresholds, this technique can only  be implemented by using solar array materials that do not decompose under the  high heat of an arc. This excludes the use of Kapton\u00ae, certain adhesives, and  non-refractory metals in solar array construction.   (which shall be determined by testing). This goal can be achieved by one of the  following:         (6) Prevent arcs from extending in duration to milliseconds or more. This task can be  achieved by sensing arc occurrence and quickly (< 200 microsecond) open-  circuiting strings where arcs occur (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.2.4).  c. [SCR 10] Dielectric breakdown of structure surface coatings shall be prevented  with one or more of the following methods (but see also NASA-HDBK-4006,  Appendix D, section D.2.4.2):                                   dielectric strength of the coating. This limitation can be achieved by one of the  following:     interconnects (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.1) or closely  spaced coverslides (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section C.1.1.4.1).   4006, Appendix D, section D.2.3, but be careful of creating Paschen discharge  conditions).       surface potential is close to the underlying conductor potential (but be careful  that the capacitance across the coating does not become great enough to  exacerbate arc damage when arcs occur).   original dielectric breakdown (see above), or by preventing the spacecraft\u2019s  electron current collection from reaching the sustained arc threshold (which  shall be determined by testing) for the dielectric material. This task can be  achieved by one of the following methods:   be determined by testing, see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix C, section  C.1.1.4.3).      C. Encapsulating all exposed electron collecting conductors, or by other  techniques for limiting electron current collection (see below).                               (1) Keep potentials of exposed conductors below the Paschen minimum for all  ambient and emitted gases (see NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix D, section  D.1). This can be achieved by one or all of the following methods:  . Encapsulating exposed electron-collecting conductors (be careful not  to create Paschen discharge conditions below the encapsulation).    (2) Prevent the neutral pressure from entering the Paschen regime for the  spacecraft plasma sheath dimensions. This task can be achieved by the  following methods:                                                                (2) Prevent arc currents from traversing the human body or other circuits sensitive to  power surges. This task can be achieved by using sneak-circuit analysis to make  sure astronauts or sensitive circuits are not in the direct path of current flow  during an arc.   can be achieved by preventing the arc from becoming a sustained arc (see  above).     limitation can be achieved by preventing dielectric breakdown or solar array  arcing on surfaces that are used for thermal control, optical surfaces, possible  electromagnetic interference (EMI)-radiating surfaces, electronics enclosures,  and the like. See above for techniques to prevent dielectric breakdown and/or  solar array arcing on these surfaces. Arcs on surfaces that are not critical to  spacecraft systems and will not contaminate sensitive surfaces nor radiate into  sensitive electronics do not require arc prevention.      .1.7.1  General LEO Standard Requirements shall always be verified by testing.    .1.7.2  and/or large parasitic plasma currents shall never be attempted solely by analysis. No substitute  exists for testing in a simulated LEO environment under simulated (worst-case) operational  conditions. Test the particular design, have a knowledgeable spacecraft electrostatic discharge  (ESD) engineer review the design at the earliest possible stage in the program, and ensure  continuing support is provided through launch. (See NASA-HDBK-4006, Appendix F, for  appropriate test conditions.)                 ue to the complexity and uniqueness of space flight, it is unlikely that all of the requirements in a NASA technical standard will  apply.

STRS provides a common, consistent framework to abstract the application  software from the STRS platform hardware to reduce the cost and risk of using complex  reconfigurable and reprogrammable radio systems across NASA missions. It achieves this  objective by defining an architecture to enable the reuse of applications (waveforms and services  implemented on the SDR) across heterogeneous SDR platforms and reduce dependence on a  single vendor. The NASA Technical Standard provides a detailed description and set of  requirements to implement the architecture. The NASA Technical Standard focuses on the key  architecture components and subsystems by describing their functionality and interfaces for both  the hardware and the software, including the applications. The intended audience for this NASA  Technical Standard is composed of software and hardware developers who need architecture  specification details to develop an STRS platform or application.     corresponding NASA Technical Handbook, NASA-HDBK-4009A, Space Telecommunications  Radio System (STRS) Architecture Standard Rationale, provides the rationale for the decisions made  to develop the architecture, provides additional information to clarify the requirements, gives further  examples, and answers questions from users.  his NASA Technical Standard is only one of a set of documents to be provided by the mission  and used by the STRS platform providers or STRS application developers in the development of  an STRS-compliant radio and/or applications. This NASA Technical Standard defines a standard  part of the architecture for software-defined radios. The complete architecture is determined by  the project. Typical radio acquisition specifications, which include size, weight, power, radiation  and safety requirements, connector details, performance and behavior requirements,  documentation, and data rights agreements are to accompany this NASA Technical Standard in a  radio procurement.  he purpose of this NASA Technical Standard is to establish an open architecture specification  for NASA space and ground SDRs. Currently, most missions either use hardware radios, which  cannot be modified once deployed, or software-defined radios with an architecture that depends  on the radio provider and involves significant effort to add new applications. The development of  this NASA Technical Standard is part of the larger STRS program currently underway to define  NASA\u2019s application of software-defined, reconfigurable technology to meet future space  communications and navigation system needs. Software-based SDRs enable advanced operations  that potentially reduce mission life-cycle costs for space or ground platforms.                SDR technology allows radios to be reconfigured to perform different functions without the  necessity of using multiple radios to accomplish each communication function, enabling radio  count reduction to decrease mass and power resources.   developed for SDRs using this NASA Technical Standard. Adherence to this NASA Technical  Standard for the development of SDR platforms and applications and submittal of the  applications to the repository will enable the missions to leverage earlier efforts by reusing  various software components compliant with the architecture developed in other NASA  programs. This will reduce the cost and risk of deploying SDRs for future NASA missions.   documentation defined by this STRS Standard provide the ability to port applications among  heterogeneous platforms reducing the knowledge of a second platform, reduce the reliance on the  initial STRS platform providers, and enable the implementation of waveforms and services that a  project envisions for its SDRs.  time, cost, and risk of using SDRs while still accommodating advances in technology. The  advent of software-based applications allows minimal rework to reuse applications and to adapt  to evolving requirements. The architecture does not include mission-specific functional and  performance requirements such as contents or format of the external interfaces to the SDR;  waveform-specific requirements such as data rate, coding scheme, and modulation and  demodulation techniques; specific hardware; or security, fault tolerance, redundancy, and fault  mitigation approaches. Instead, the architecture is careful to enable all solutions that the mission  might require as they relate to the mission-specific functional and performance specifications.     \u2022 Usable across most NASA mission types (scalability and flexibility).  \u2022 Decrease development time and cost.  \u2022  \u2022 Accommodate advances in technology with minimal rework (extensibility).  \u2022 Adaptable to evolving requirements (adaptability).  \u2022 Leverage existing or developing standards, resources, and experience (state-of-the-art   \u2022 Maintain vendor independence.  \u2022 Enable waveform application portability and reusability.                    To meet these goals and objectives, the STRS architecture has an open architecture design that  accommodates the range of radio form factors that are envisioned by NASA for all mission  classes.  The architecture can also not preclude the implementation of mission-developed services on the  SDR such as:    \u2022 Commanded built-in-test (BIT) and status reporting.  \u2022 Real-time operational diagnostics.  \u2022 Automated system recovery and initialization.  \u2022 Networking and navigation within the SDR.  \u2022 Secure transmission.  \u2022 Shared processing among on-board elements.   his STRS Standard consists of hardware, configurable hardware design, and software  architectures with accompanying description, guidance, and requirements. The hardware  architecture is defined in section 4. Section 5 outlines the process and requirements associated  with application development. The configurable hardware design architecture is defined in  section 6. The software architecture is defined in section 7. An overview of each is provided  below.  The terms \u201csoftware\u201d and \u201cconfigurable hardware design\u201d are used in this NASA Technical  Standard to distinguish the architecture items that apply to code (source code, object code,  executables, etc.) implemented on a processor; and designs (hardware description language  (HDL) source, loadable files, data tables, etc.) implemented in a configurable hardware device  such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Both items can change the functionality of the  radio in-situ using program control. The term \u201csoftware\u201d is also used in a generic sense in this  NASA Technical Standard to discuss all configurable items of the radio, including configurable  hardware design. The terminology used is not meant to imply design and implementation  process.   hardware architecture requirements are written so that the hardware provider defines the  functional breakdown (modules) of the system and publishes the functions and interfaces for  each module and for the entire STRS platform in a hardware interface description (HID)  document. Using this information enables NASA and others developing applications or  additional modules, or interfacing to the platform, to have the knowledge to integrate and test the  hardware interfaces and understand the features and limitations of the platform.  This NASA Technical Standard encourages the development of applications that are modular,  portable, reconfigurable, and reusable. STRS applications use the STRS infrastructure-provided  application program interfaces (APIs) and services to load, verify, execute, change parameters,           terminate, or unload an application. The STRS applications are submitted to the NASA STRS  Application Repository to allow applications to be reused in the future according to any accepted  release agreements. The NASA STRS Application Repository contains software, configurable  hardware design, metadata, and documentation for STRS applications, STRS Devices, and  operating environments (OEs). The appropriate application artifacts provide future missions the  information to use the application with limited effort.  applications that are partially or fully implemented in a hardware device such as an FPGA. Early  consideration to enable reuse during the development of configurable hardware design is critical.  Suggestions are provided to decrease the reuse and porting effort, and requirements are included  for the development of configurable hardware design to use the platform-specified abstraction.   he STRS software architecture is the focus of the current version of the STRS Standard. The  software architectural model describes the relationship between the software elements, defined in  layers, in an STRS-compliant radio. The model illustrates the different software elements used in  the software execution and defines the API layers between an STRS application and the OE, and  between the OE and the hardware platform.  he STRS software layers are separated to enable developers to implement the software layers  differently according to their requirements while still complying with the STRS architecture. A  key aspect is the abstraction of the STRS application, which is either a waveform or service,  from the underlying OE software to promote portability and reusability of the STRS application.  The STRS software architecture uses three primary interfaces, as follows: (1) the STRS APIs; (2)  the STRS hardware abstraction layer (HAL) specification; and (3) the Portable Operating System  Interface (POSIX\u00ae). The STRS APIs provide the interfaces that allow applications to be  instantiated and use platform services. These APIs also enable communication between STRS  applications and the STRS infrastructure. The HAL provides a software view of the specialized  hardware by abstracting the physical hardware of interfaces. It is to be published so that software  and configurable hardware design running on the platform\u2019s specialized hardware can integrate  with the STRS infrastructure.  organizations performing various tasks. The separation of requirements, responsibilities, and  resulting tasks is assigned in this NASA Technical Standard by logical role where each role has  requirements that may be satisfied by an individual or delegated to a subordinate organization(s).  As Figure 1, Roles and Responsibilities, illustrates, the effort begins with a mission need for a  radio, which could support communications, navigation, and in some instances even networking  functions. The mission system engineer defines radio system requirements. For each mission, the  STRS integrators, STRS platform providers, and STRS application developers are selected.  Eventually, the platform and applications are integrated into the STRS-compliant radio product.  Both the hardware and software are tailored to meet mission-specific needs.                the SDR hardware platform, including the STRS OE (e.g., infrastructure, OS), and associated  documentation. The OE and hardware platform are a unique set and become the SDR platform.   platform. The STRS platform provider is responsible for the FPGA platform-specific wrapper  and software header files specifying the required interface, constants, typedefs, and structs. The  STRS platform provider is also responsible for any STRS script formats or software  configuration file formats, any extensible markup language (XML) schema, and any  transformation tool for controlling instantiation, and their associated documentation, if deemed  necessary. If the STRS platform provider delegates responsibility for part of the OE to a separate  infrastructure provider, the responsibility for the appropriate files and documentation may be  delegated to that provider as well. If the STRS platform provider delegates responsibility for part  of the hardware to a separate hardware provider, the responsibility for the pertinent HID  documentation may be delegated to that hardware provider as well. The STRS platform provider                  he mission and the STRS application developer have the responsibility to evaluate the contents  of the STRS repository against the mission-developed application requirements and determine if  a new application should be developed or if an appropriate application exists in the repository  that is a candidate for a port to the defined platform. Depending on the results of this decision,  the STRS application developer either creates a new application or ports an existing STRS  application, usually retrieved from the STRS repository. The STRS application developer  performs unit tests, and documents the functionality.  is ultimately responsible to integrate and deliver all aspects of the platform and OE  documentation.   platform. The STRS integrator could be the STRS platform provider, the STRS application  developer(s), a mission engineer, or even a third party. The STRS integrator\u2019s role is to have the  application properly running on the SDR platform to meet the communication, navigation, or  other functions of the mission. Once the STRS radio integration is complete, it is delivered to a  system integrator who incorporates it into the mission spacecraft system. Software updates are  possible during the STRS radio and system integration. Following system integration, the STRS  application developer delivers the version of the software used for the deployed system, and the  associated documentation, to the STRS repository.  t is likely that multiple applications will be developed for a single STRS platform prior to  deployment and during its operational lifetime. During operations, after the radio has been  deployed, additional application providers, who may be independent of the original platform or  application provider, could develop additional applications for the original STRS radio. The new  providers develop applications for the SDR platform much like the original application provider  and deliver the application to the same or possibly a different STRS integrator. Following  successful integration, the application software is delivered to the STRS Application Repository.  Mission operations performs the role of system integrator when uploading the application to the  STRS radio.  STRS-compliant platform is envisioned. The mission 2 application provider may withdraw  applications from the repository to use for the new STRS radio project. The mission 2  application follows a similar path of delivery to the mission 2 STRS integrator who incorporates  the new hardware platform material and delivers the mission 2 STRS radio based on the original  application and new hardware platform. As more and more missions deploy SDRs, new  platforms and applications may be developed but also platforms and software are reused,  marking the significant difference with the new technology compared to legacy radios.    of reconfigurable components useable for space radios. The need to reduce the cost and risk of  using SDRs was identified and the development of the STRS architecture was initiated. In 2007,           the architecture was determined to be ready for flight implementation in a technology  development project. This project was originally called the Communication, Navigation, and  Networking reConfigurable Testbed (CoNNeCT). CoNNeCT was later renamed the SCaN  Testbed. Three SDRs, compliant with the STRS architecture, were procured in 2008 and 2009  for the Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Testbed, using the architecture defined in  a technical memorandum and referred to in the procurement specifications as Version 1.02.1.  The SCaN Testbed was launched in July 2012 and operates on an external truss on the  International Space Station (ISS). The SCaN Testbed is an experimental communications system  that provides the capability for S-Band, Ka-Band, and L-Band communication with space and  ground assets. Investigation of SDR technology and the STRS architecture are the primary focus  of the SCaN Testbed. As a completely reconfigurable testbed, the SCaN Testbed provides  experimenters an opportunity to develop and demonstrate experimental waveforms and  applications for communication, networking, and navigation concepts and to advance the  understanding of operating SDRs in space. Lessons learned from the STRS platform provider,  STRS application developers, and STRS integrators of the SCaN Testbed provided critical  insight for the development of the current NASA Technical Standard contained in this document.  The updates from the Version 1.02.1 Technical Memorandum to the NASA-STD-4009 can be  requested from the STRS project.

Note: The BSP leverages commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) device drivers and  other software necessary for applications to access the specific hardware.

Note: Configurable hardware design is often informally\u2014and often  incorrectly\u2014referred to as firmware. Notes: (1) This term is sometimes used  to refer only to the hardware device or only to the computer instructions or  data, but these meanings are deprecated. (2) The confusion surrounding this  term has led some to suggest that it be avoided altogether.\u201d   is not being used. The term \u201cconfigurable hardware design\u201d was selected  instead. For a configurable hardware device such as an FPGA, it includes  the FPGA source code written in HDL, the image stored in random access  memory (RAM) and used by the FPGA, and supporting hardware  configuration files, if applicable.         running properly in its environment, including installation, configuration, running, testing, and  making necessary changes.                    External Interface: Functional and physical connections at the boundaries of a system  that are designed to interoperate with other systems or components.  Note: Examples include interfaces to or from the flight computer, power, data sources,  data sinks, antennas, mounting locations, and optical links.        Note: The flight computer may be connected to the STRS radio electrically,  electromagnetically, optically, etc. The flight computer may contain the watchdog  timer for the STRS radio.    Note: The GPM usually consists of the general purpose processor (GPP),  appropriate memory (both volatile and nonvolatile), system bus, the spacecraft (or  host) telemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) interface, ground support  telemetry and test interface, and the components to support the radio  configuration. The GPP may be remote or include a system-on-a-chip, if  necessary.          module\u2019s physical and electrical connections, performance, capability, size, weight and power,  as applicable, to enable integration between components of the system.

Hierarchical Structure: Structure that characterizes a system in which components are  contained by other components and/or provide services to the next higher-level components.

This type of structure allows  each layer to be modified without affecting the other layers.   another system; (2) capability of different radio systems or radio networks to communicate and  exchange information with each other.  Note: Dissimilar systems or networks may achieve interoperability by changing their  operating parameters to a common compatible format or by operating through a bridge  that translates between incompatible formats. An alternate definition is to determine  and adapt all radio parameters required for broadest communication compatibility  across all target networks.    Note: The radio may have limited options for tuning, data rate, and so forth or  may even carry multiple types of data, but it is incapable of adapting to new  waveforms.      ote: A software module (program module) performs specific tasks within a software  system. A hardware module is a physical grouping of devices capable of implementing  specific functions.                             Note: OSS has its source code freely available, and end-users have the right to modify  and redistribute the software to others.

Note: RFM-associated components may include filters, RF switches, diplexers,  low noise amplifiers (LNAs), power amplifiers, analog-to-digital converters  (ADC), and digital-to-analog converters (DAC). This module handles the  interfaces that control the final stage of the transmission or first stage of the  reception of the wireless signals, including antennas.                           Note: Software reconfiguration control of such radios may involve any element of the  radio-communication network. SDRs are a subset of reconfigurable radios.                       Note: For example, a selectable parameter may be modified to change system  characteristics at runtime.     signal processing used to handle the transformation of received digitally formatted signals into  data packets and/or the conversion of data packets into digitally formatted signals to be  transmitted.

For example, in the term  \u201csoftware defined radio,\u201d the word \u201csoftware\u201d includes configurable hardware  design. In other contexts, the word \u201csoftware\u201d is meant to imply code running on  a processor, especially in the Software Architecture section. In this case, even if  the processor is embedded within configurable hardware, the software that  executes on the processor is not \u201cconfigurable hardware design.\u201d     components, and design rules according to which radio communications systems may be  organized, designed, constructed, deployed, operated, and evolved over time.  Note: A useful architecture partitions functions and components such that (1) functions  are assigned to components clearly, and (2) physical interfaces among components  correspond to logical interfaces among functions.    Note: An STRS device is a software device that is part of the STRS infrastructure,  having a well-defined and portable API that may use the HAL to read, write, and  control hardware devices.   opposed to ASICs and FPGAs. A software radio implements communications functions  primarily through software in conjunction with minimal hardware.  Note: Software radios are the ideal SDR in which digitization occurs at the  antenna.                                  beyond what is allowed for an STRS application such as communicating with specialized  hardware.                   Thread-Safe: Function that works correctly during simultaneous execution by multiple  threads, without unwanted interaction between the threads. A thread is a part of a program that               can execute independently of other parts. A thread is the smallest sequence of programmed  instructions that can be managed independently by an OS scheduler.  Note: A function that is reentrant is automatically thread-safe, but the reverse is not  necessarily true.          a problem is detected within a certain time period, take the appropriate action to restore the  system back to health.   transmitted over the air and the corresponding set of transformations to convert received signals  back to their information contents.  Note: Traditionally, a waveform was simply an electromagnetic signal whose  amplitude varies with time.    Note: The waveform application can be distributed among various processing  elements, including specialized hardware (e.g., FPGAs and DSPs). In STRS, if the  waveform application requires run-time support for functions that it cannot provide  directly, it is to use the STRS APIs in the infrastructure to access the desired functions  whether or not they are provided by the infrastructure directly or by other waveforms or  services.  n addition to providing benefits by defining a standard software infrastructure for NASA\u2019s  radios, this NASA Technical Standard also defines standards for the hardware portion of the  radio. Hardware technologies usually change more rapidly than software, and each radio  implementation generally has very specific spacecraft dependencies and requirements.  Therefore, the STRS hardware architecture is specified at a functional level rather than at the                   physical implementation level. Also, a functional-level architecture will remain applicable over a  longer time frame. It should be noted that programs have the latitude to standardize hardware  requirements at the implementation level for multiple radio procurements.  The STRS hardware architecture was developed with consideration of several key constraints  and conditions for operating space SDRs. One major issue driving the hardware architecture  formulation was the need for flexibility, so that a single architecture is capable of addressing the  range of different mission classes. The mission classes have radio requirements that range from  requiring small radios that are highly optimized to meet severe size, weight, and power  constraints, to missions requiring complex radios with multiple operating frequencies and higher  data rates. This implies that the hardware architecture accommodates a range of reconfigurable  processing technologies, including GPPs, DSP, and FPGAs, as well as ASICs with selectable  parameters. Currently, reconfigurable signal processing is primarily performed in specialized  signal-processing hardware for the frequencies and data rates used in NASA space missions, and  this is expected to continue for some time. In addition to providing capability, specialized signal  processing is generally more power efficient than general purpose processing. In almost all  cases, a DSP-based implementation is a lower power option than FPGA-based. The needs for  specialized processing are supplemented by the software infrastructure, which is more suited for  execution in a GPP. The architecture also enables technology infusion over time,  accommodating the rapidly evolving capabilities of processor speeds and signal processing. In  addition, the conversion point, where the signal is digitized, is moving closer to the antenna.  Considering these points, the architecture provides a flexible framework, emphasizing common  terminology for hardware functions and interfaces, common documentation, and common  formats and requirements for waveform and service STRS application developers to utilize a  platform\u2019s capabilities. The architecture does not prescribe a specific hardware implementation  approach.   HID specifies the electrical interfaces, connector requirements, and physical requirements for  the delivered radio. Each module\u2019s HID abstracts and defines the module functionality and  performance.   within the hardware architecture diagrams. The hardware diagram illustrates the radio  functions and the interconnects for each module. The modules are a logical and functional  division of common radio functions that comprise an STRS platform. Modules are not intended  to represent physical entities of the platform. As developers choose how to distribute and  implement the radio functions among hardware elements, the specification provides the guidance  on the interfaces and abstractions that are to be provided to comply with the architecture. The             module and function connections provided in the diagrams are data path, control, signal clock,  and external interfaces.              Radio  Function  General  Purpose  Processing  Module (GPM)  Specialized  Processing  Module (SPM)  Radio  Frequency  Module (RFM)   igure 3, Notional STRS Hardware Architecture Implementation, shows the high-level STRS  hardware architecture. The figure illustrates the functional attributes and interfaces for each  module. A module is a combination of logical and functional representations of platform and  applications implemented in a radio. The modules are divided into their typical functions to  provide a common description and terminology reference. Each STRS platform provider has the  flexibility to combine these modules and their functionality as necessary during the radio design  process to meet the specific mission requirements. Additional modules can be added for  increased capability.  The hardware architecture does not specify a physical implementation internally on each  module, nor does it mandate the standards or ratings of the hardware used to construct the  radios. Thus, the radio supplier can encapsulate company proprietary circuit or software  designs, provided the modules meet the specific architecture rules and expose the interfaces  defined for each module. There is flexibility to physically combine or split these modules as  necessary during the radio design process to meet the specific mission requirements or to  optimize the design. For example, all RF and signal-processing components or functions may be  integrated onto a single printed circuit board, easing footprint, interface, and integration issues,  or an approach with multiple boards and enclosures could be used. Similarly, an FPGA could                 ach mission, or class of missions, may choose to standardize certain interfaces and physical  packaging. This approach provides NASA with the flexibility to adopt different implementation  standards for various mission classes. Thus, if a series of radios are required with common  operating requirements, physical construction details, such as bus chassis or card slice, can be  part of the acquisition strategy for cost-effective modularity at a lower level to match the life  cycle of the hardware. Another example of the flexibility is where a large mission class program  may choose to standardize the details of the RF-to-signal-processing interface. This might be  done to facilitate the use of different RF modules, but the same signal processing module, for  radios used for several similar missions.  potentially contain both the SPM functions and the GPP, or the SPM functions could be split  between an FPGA and the GPM.   should be noted that not all the elements shown in each module are necessarily required for  implementation. This architecture specifies the functionality of each module, but it does not  necessarily specify how they are implemented. Mission requirements will dictate the  implementation approach to each module, and the modules required in each radio.                  fashion. The generic hardware architecture diagram identifies three main functional components  or modules of the STRS radio. Although not shown in Figure 3, additional modules (e.g., optical,  networking, and security) can be added for increased capability and will be included in the  specification as it matures. The hardware architecture currently consists of the following  modules:    eneral-Purpose Processing Module: Consists of the GPP, appropriate memory (both volatile  and nonvolatile), system bus, the spacecraft (or host) TT&C interface, ground test interface, and  the components to support the radio configuration.  ignal-Processing Module: This module contains the implementations of the signal processing  used to handle the transformation of received digitally formatted signals into data packets  and/or the conversion of data packets into digitally formatted signals to be transmitted. Also  included is the spacecraft data interface. Components include ASICs, FPGAs, DSPs, memory,  and connection fabric or bus.  Radio Frequency Module: This module handles the RF functionality to provide the SPM with  the filtered, amplified, and digitally formatted signal. In the case of transmission, the module  formats, filters, and amplifies the output signal. Its associated components include filters, RF  switches, diplexer, LNAs, power amplifiers, ADCs, and DACs. This module handles the  interfaces that control the final stage of transmission or the first stage of reception of the  wireless signals, including antennas.  ecurity Module (SEC): Though not directly identified in the generic hardware diagram, an  SEC is also being proposed to allow STRS radios to support future security requirements. The  details of this module will be defined in later revisions of the architecture.  Systems (CCSDS) and Internet Property (IPs) and networking functions. However, the Network  Module (NM) may be realized as a combination of both the GPM and SPM.    The detail of this module will be defined in later revisions of the architecture. (It has many  similarities to RFM, but these are for optical carriers.)   to be implemented on all modules to some level. The details are mission specific and are stated  as part of the radio acquisition. The related control and interface requirements for the shared  module functions are stated in the corresponding module section.              Test and Status: Each module (or combination of modules) should provide a means to query the  current health of the module and run diagnostics.  ault Monitoring and Recovery: Each module (or combination of modules) should incorporate  detection of operational errors, upsets, and major component failures. These may be caused by  the radiation environment (e.g., single-event upsets (SEUs)), temperature fluctuations, or power  supply anomalies. In addition to detection, mitigation and fail-safe techniques should be  employed. Each module should have a default power-up mode to provide the minimal  functionality required by the mission. This fail-safe mode should have minimal software and/or  configurable hardware design dependency.  adio Data Path: SDRs can be implemented with or without the GPM in the data path. The  STRS architecture supports the separation of the RFM and SPM data paths from the GPM.  Giving the GPM access to the data path as an optional capability rather than a required  capability allows for a more efficient implementation for medium and small mission classes and  improves the overall performance for near-term implementations. If space-qualified GPM  components mature with the performance capabilities required for signal processing, the GPM  can exist within the data path and take on more signal-processing functionality, increasing  flexibility.  TRS Radio Startup Process: The startup of the STRS infrastructure is expected to be initiated  by the STRS platform boot process, so that it can receive and send external commands and  instantiate applications. The startup process might include built-in tests for self-diagnostics to  verify nominal system functionality. In order to control an STRS platform at power-up and to  recover from error conditions, an STRS platform is to have a known power-up condition that sets  the state of all modules. To support upgrades to the OE, an STRS platform requires the ability to  alter the state (boot parameters) and/or select a boot image. The exact mechanisms and  procedures used will be platform and mission specific but need to be sufficient to support  upgrades to OE components, such as the OS, BSP, and STRS infrastructure.     \u2022 Host TT&C.  \u2022 Ground Test.  \u2022 Data.  \u2022 Clock.  \u2022 Antenna.  \u2022 Operating power.  \u2022 Mission defined.               spacecraft (or other host) to communicate with the radio. The host telemetry typically carries all  information sourced within the radio. This type of information traditionally is called the  telemetry data and includes health, status, and performance parameters of the radio as well as  the link in use. In addition, this telemetry often includes radiometric tracking and navigation  data. The command portion of this interface contains the information that has the radio itself as  the destination of the information. Configuration parameters, configuration data files, new  software data files, and operational commands are the typical types of information found on this  interface.  he Ground Test Interface provides a \u201cdevelopment-level\u201d view of the radio and is exclusively  used for ground-based integration and testing functions. It typically provides low-level access to  internal parameters not typically available to the Spacecraft TT&C Interface. It can also provide  access when the GPM is not functioning (i.e., during boot).  The Data Interface is the primary interface for data that are sourced from the other end of the  link and for data that are sunk to the other end of the link. This interface is separate from the  TT&C interface because it typically has a different set of transfer parameters (protocol, speeds,  volumes, etc.) than the TT&C information. A common interface point in the spacecraft for this  type of interface is the spacecraft solid-state recorder rather than the spacecraft command and  data-handling (C&DH) subsystem. This interface is also characterized by medium to high  latency and high data rates.   navigation and tracking. This type of input frequency reference is essential to the operation of  the radio and provides references to the SPM and RFM. There does not have to be an external  clock interface if the SPM or RFM contains an oscillator that performs this function  he Antenna Interface is used to connect the electromagnetic signal (input or output) to the  radiating element or elements of the spacecraft. It also includes the necessary capability for  switching among the elements if required by the mission. Steering the elements, if a function of  the overall telecommunications system, is possible through this interface, but it is not typically  employed because of overall operational constraints.  specification at the highest levels. The Power Interface defines the types and conditions of the  input energy to power the radio.   he Mission-defined Interface, which is not included in the diagram, could monitor conditions  that the radio encounters such as external temperature, solar radiation, magnetic field strength,  attitude, etc. The mission would assign what to do with these values. A thermal interface that  monitors temperature could be used to activate a heating element or adjust dynamic factors  dependent on temperature in a known way.               networking interface does not necessarily map directly to the SPM, GPM, or RFM. The  networking interface might handle only spacecraft TT&C data or both spacecraft TT&C data  and radio data. This architecture allows for those capabilities.     o support the overall goals of the architecture, the internal interfaces (GPM system bus, GPM  RFM control, SPM-to-GPM test, frequency reference, and data path) should be well documented  and available without restriction.  The GPM system bus (orange lines in Figure 3) provides the primary interconnect between  elements of the GPM. The GPM system bus may provide an interface between the  microprocessor, the memory elements, and the external interfaces (TT&C and Test) of the GPM.  The GPM system bus is the primary interface between the GPM and the SPM, as shown in the  interconnection with the major SPM processing elements. Finally, the GPM system bus provides  the interface by which the reprogrammable and reconfigurable elements of the SDR are  modified. It supports both the read and write access to the SPM elements, as well as the  reloading of hardware configuration files to the FPGAs.  The interface between the GPM and the RFM is primarily a control/status interface. Various  RFM elements are controlled by the set of GPM RFM control lines (blue lines in Figure 3).  Coming from the System Control block in the GPM, this control bus can be either fixed by the  System Control function or programmed by the GPM software and validated and routed by the  System Control function. It is important to have a hardware-based confirmation and limit-check  on the software controlling any RFM elements. The System Control module of the GPM provides  this functionality, thus keeping the GPM RFM Control bus within operational limits.   from different modules or functions to the Ground Test Interface block. This interface is used  during development and testing to validate the operation of the various radio functions. This  interface is very specific to the implementation and realization of the different modules.  he Frequency Reference Interface provides an important interface between the RFM and the  SPM functions. It ties the two modules together in a way that allows for the SDR to implement  tracking and navigation functions. The characteristics of this interface are defined by the various  amounts of tracking accuracy required by the mission for the SPM to accomplish. This interface  can be as simple as a single, common frequency reference that is conditioned from an outside  source and distributed in the least degrading fashion possible to the SPM.   major blocks of the primary data path. For any particular implementation, the data path or  bitstreams are defined by the particular application implemented in the functional blocks. The           interface between the RFM and SPM should be well defined and have characteristics suitable for  that level of conversion between the analog and digital domains.  implementers to consider and follow, if the implementation dictates the necessity of particular  components. Details of the GPM, SPM, and RFM are provided in subsequent sections.    one or more general purpose or digital signal-processing elements and support hardware  components, embedded OS, software applications and interfaces to support the configuration,  control, and status of the radio. The number of processing elements and the extent of support  hardware will vary depending on the mission-class processing and data-handling requirements  from a single system on a chip implementation for smaller mission classes to multiple logical  replaceable units (LRUs) for the largest mission classes. In addition, fault tolerance  requirements can also increase the number of hardware processing elements, support hardware  components, and interface points required to meet the range of mission classes. The majority of  processing functions of the GPM will be under software control and supported by an OS.  Mission-specific data handling speeds may require the use of separate specialized support  hardware (FPGA or ASIC chips) to alleviate the burden on the processing elements. Such  specialized support hardware could include encryption, packet routing, and network processing-  type functions.                    he GPM contains, as necessary, a GPP and various memory elements as shown in Figure 4.  Depending on the particular mission class, not all memory elements are required. The GPP will  typically be implemented as a microprocessor, but it could take many forms, depending on the  mission class. Because the GPM is the primary control component of the radio, it is a required  module for an STRS radio. A description of each element follows.   The GPP functions include the OE, the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and potentially  application functions. The OE contains the STRS infrastructure, which provides the functionality  for the interfaces defined by the STRS APIs specification. The OE also contains the OS and the  POSIX\u00ae abstraction layer. The HAL is the library of software functions in the STRS OE that  provides a platform-vendor-specific view of the specialized hardware by abstracting the  underlying physical hardware interfaces. The HAL allows specialized hardware to be integrated  with the GPM so that the STRS OE can access functions implemented on the specialized  hardware of the STRS platform.  he Persistent Memory Storage element holds both the permanent (e.g., programmable read-  only memory (PROM)) and reprogrammable code for the GPP element. In today\u2019s technology,  this code is implemented using a reprogrammable technology, such as electrically erasable,  programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). It is also possible, but not typically qualifiable, to  implement this code storage in Flash memory.   (i.e., configurable hardware design). The GPM may be responsible for programming and  scrubbing the SPM FPGAs and, if so, would have access to the appropriate \u201ccode\u201d for the  FPGAs. This memory block is typically implemented using a nonvolatile memory technology,  such as EEPROM, but could, in particular implementations, be implemented with PROM  technology.   element. This memory element is implemented in concert with the GPP element and may contain  both data and code, as appropriate for the execution of the radio application running in the  GPM.   bus. This element provides the necessary control for the System Bus, including the various  memory and SPM elements interfaced by the System Bus. In addition, the System Control  element provides a validated interface to the RFM hardware via the GPM RFM Control  Interface. As the software running on the GPP element commands the RFM elements into certain  states, those commands are interpreted by the System Control element and validated in a manner  that will prevent damaging configurations of the RFM; for example, tying the transmit amplifier  directly to the receive amplifier, bypassing the diplexer element. This level of validation in the  GPM-to-RFM interfaces would prevent damage to the radio from a software bug. The System             Control element is typically implemented by a non-reprogrammable (in-flight) FPGA allowing  for flexibility between instantiations of a particular implementation.     a.

STRS-109) An STRS platform shall have a GPM that contains and executes the STRS OE and  the control portions of the STRS applications and services software.     transform received digital signals into data packets and/or the conversion of data packets into  digital signals to transmit. The complexity of this module is based on the applications and data  rates selected for a mission. The SPM modules contain components and capabilities to  manipulate and manage digital signals that need higher processing capabilities than that  supplied by the GPM. The configurable hardware design architecture describes a common  interface for the application on the SPM, as described in section 6. Figure 5, SPM Architecture  Details, illustrates the SPM module details.                       ASICs, and other integrated circuits. However, technologies will change over time, so the  specific implementation is left to the STRS platform provider.    t is also anticipated that STRS platforms may use dedicated SPM physical hardware slices (e.g.,  separate circuit boards) for specific applications and technologies. For example, a dedicated  global positioning system (GPS) receiver slice can complement the existence of reconfigurable  SPM slices in the same radio. The dedicated slice offloads demand on the less specific SPM. If  an STRS platform contains an SPM slice, the slice should meet the module interface  specifications for control and configuration and have an interface with the GPM via the GPM  system bus and the SPM-to-GPM test interface. These two interfaces work in concert to provide  a control and reprogramming path to the SPM from the GPM and the application running on the  GPM.  he SPM performs the digital signal-processing functions, which are used to convert symbols to  bits (and vice versa). These functions are typically implemented on FPGAs, DSPs, or ASICs. It is  recommended that reconfigurable and reprogrammable devices be used because this allows for  new applications to be implemented on the SDR in the future without a hardware redesign.  However, mission-specific requirements may dictate that the application be implemented on a  non-reprogrammable hardware device.  n addition to the digital signal-processing functions, a data-formatting function is typically  provided to convert blocks of data stored in the data storage element into bitstreams appropriate  for encoding into symbols (and vice versa). In many cases, it is possible to implement the data-  formatting function in the same device as the digital signal-processing function, but that is an  implementation detail dependent on the mission class.   data storage element is used to provide a queuing buffer between the data interface and the  bitstream coders and decoders. This data storage function can be implemented in either volatile  or nonvolatile memory, depending on the requirements of the mission implementation.      \u2022 Digital up conversion\u2014interpolation, filtering, and \u201clocal oscillator\u201d multiplication  of baseband samples to obtain an IF or RF output sample stream, appropriate for  digital-to-analog conversion. This is typically the last transmit function implemented  in the SPM, and the output samples are sent to the RFM.               typically the first receive function implemented in the SPM, with input samples  coming from the analog-to-digital conversion in the RFM.  \u2022 Digital filtering\u2014averaging, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, polyphase, and other  filters used for pulse shaping, matched filter, etc. This may overlap with some of the  functionality in the Up and Down Conversion.  \u2022 Carrier recovery and tracking\u2014retrieval of the waveform carrier within the receive  sample stream. Typical SPM functions for carrier recovery include shifting the  recovered carrier frequency to compensate for local oscillator variations and  Doppler shifts in the link.  \u2022 Synchronization (data, symbol, etc.)\u2014alignment of received samples with symbol and  data boundaries. There may be some integration with the Digital Down Conversion  and Carrier Recovery and Tracking functions.        \u2022 Data detection (demodulation)\u2014translating receive symbol samples to data bits.  \u2022 Spreading and despreading\u2014a form of encoding data to obtain certain energy   \u2022 Scrambling and descrambling\u2014a form of encoding data to ensure a certain level of  randomness in the digital data stream, usually for synchronization of the receiver.  \u2022 Encryption and decryption\u2014a form of encoding data for security purposes.  \u2022 Data Input/Output (I/O) (high-speed direct from or to source or sink)\u2014interface for  transmit and/or receive data to come in or out of the module. This may involve  buffering and some protocol handling.  he SPM\u2019s functions and external interfaces are shown in Figure 5. Interfaces shown include  those common to all module types as well as those specific for the SPM. These SPM-specific  interfaces may not all be required for some missions. Note that the implementation of these  interfaces may combine two or more on one physical transport. For example, the Data Interface  and Control and Configuration Interfaces may both use the same physical Serial Rapid I/O  connection.     DACs for transmission, and the digital samples from the RFM\u2019s ADCs. However, if  the DACs and ADCs are preferred to be a part of the SPM, then this interface is  replaced with analog baseband or IF signals.              It may be used, for example, to send feedback to an AGC or control frequency  hopping.        \u2022 Test and status to GPM\u2014Tests are initiated through this interface by the GPM, and  results are returned. This is a more basic interface (electrically and protocol-wise)  than the Control and Configuration interface.    is usually measured by the number of FPGA gates, slices, logic elements, or bytes. This  information can be used by future STRS application developers to determine the waveforms that  can be implemented on a given platform.  he RFM handles the conversion to and from the carrier frequency, providing the SPM and/or  the GPM with digital baseband or IF signals, and the transmission and reception equipment with  RF to support the SPM and GPM functions. Its components typically include DACs, ADCs, RF  switches, up converters, down converters, diplexer, filters, LNAs, power amplifiers, etc. Current  and near-term RF technologies cannot be expected to allow multiband operation using a single  channel RFM, and thus multiband radios will need to use multiple RFM slices. The RFM  provides a band of frequency tunability on each slice. This tunability can be software controlled  through the provided interfaces.   reception of the wireless signals, including antennas, optical telescopes, steerable antennas,  external power amplifiers, diplexers, triplexers, RF switches, etc. These external radio  equipment components would otherwise be integrated with the RFM except for the physical size  and location constraints for transmission and reception. The interfaces are primarily the  associated control interfaces for these components. The RFM HID encompasses the control and  interface mechanism to the external components. The focus of the RF HID is to provide a  standardized interface to the control of each of these devices, to synchronize the operation of the  radio with any of these devices.  he other primary capability of the RFM is the conditioning and distribution of the frequency  reference as defined by the Frequency Reference Interface. This provides a common reference            for the RFM and SPM modules to enable the tracking and navigation functionality typically  provided by SDRs. Figure 6, RFM Architecture Details, illustrates the RFM module details.      a. Frequency conversion and gain control.  b. Analog filtering.  c. Analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion.  d. Radiometric tracking.                      can be implemented with a variety of different component technologies, including ASICs,  discrete electronics, programmable logic devices including FPGAs and DSPs, or even  microprocessors. The choice of technologies is left up to the developer of the particular  implementation. It is expected that the control of the devices will become more sophisticated  over time and that the level of control will increase, resulting in more complex control circuitry  and logic devices being used.    a.

Provides I/O for exchanging digitized waveform signal data.  STRS-6) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the behavior and  performance of the RF modular component(s).   he behavior and performance of the RF modular components should be sufficiently described  such that future waveform developments may take advantage of the RF capability and/or account  for its performance. Information in the HID may include such items as center frequency, IF and  RF frequency(s), bandwidth(s), IF and RF input/output level(s), dynamic range, sensitivity,  overall noise figure, AGC, frequency accuracy and stability, and frequency-tuning resolution.  architecture. Although this section is currently not complete, the goal is to address the security  services required from an SDR. This approach supports the evolutionary nature of the STRS  architecture. It is expected that this section will be expanded as new technologies and  operational modes are developed or extended.                   The architecture will support selectable data-protection services for those users needing them,  including both confidentiality and authentication. Missions may select security options provided  by the infrastructure or may develop their own.   configuration or uploading new programs for either the infrastructure or new applications. The  security section of the architecture will include support for key management, encryption  standards, and mitigating threats other than the information and communication security threats  currently identified.  he STRS architecture has been structured such that networks can be implemented in an SDR;  that is, an SDR can be a node in a network. The SDR may be connected to another node using  the appropriate logical and physical interfaces that may be wired and/or wireless. The STRS  architecture can accommodate network protocols as services that can be made available to  applications and devices. STRS supports the ability to upload new software and dynamic  hardware images. Therefore, advancements and replacement of existing protocols can be  accomplished without affecting a spacecraft\u2019s mission resources.   he STRS architecture supports the use of optical communications in SDRs. The use of optical  communications techniques poses challenges in many areas, but optical communications also  have the potential for great benefit. STRS interfacing to optical communication equipment  follows the same techniques shown in integration with high-data-rate hardware. The OM would  be controlled through the STRS HAL interface that allows configuration and control of the  digital components in the module, which abstracts the optical functionality.   interfaces, functionality, and performance of the entire platform and each platform module. The  HID specifies the electrical interfaces, connector requirements, and all physical requirements  for the delivered radio. The HID abstracts and describes the functionality and performance of  each module. In this manner, STRS application developers can know the features and limitations  of the platform for their applications. The information in the HID provides the knowledge for  NASA and others to integrate and test the hardware interfaces. The information in the HID may  allow future module replacement or additions without the design of a completely new platform.  For example, a Security Module could be added that was not originally planned, or a follow-on  mission could use a different frequency band and only an RFM change would be needed. Include  all waveform interfaces and any other interfaces that could be important to a waveform  developer or a hardware integrator.               In addition to the GPM, SPM, and RFM HID descriptions and requirements stated within each  module section, the following interface descriptions and requirements are also specified for an  STRS platform.  (STRS-4) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the behavior and  capability of each major module or component available for use by a waveform, service, or other  application (e.g., FPGA, GPP, DSP, or memory), noting any operational limitations.  The description of the behavior and capability of modules or components available to STRS  application developers or reconfigurable components may include device type, processing  capability, clock speeds, memory size(s), types(s), and speed(s), noting any constraints, as well  as any limitation on the number of configurable hardware design reloads, as applicable, partial  reload ability, built-in functionality, and any corresponding restriction on the number of gates.  (STRS-7) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the interfaces that  are provided to and from each modular component of the STRS platform.   different implementations. The STRS platform provider or STRS integrator is expected to  describe each modular component and their respective physical and logical interfaces as  described in this section. Table 1, STRS Module Interface Characterization, provides typical  interface characteristics that should be included when identifying external interfaces or internal  interfaces between modules for STRS.  (STRS-5) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the  reconfigurability behavior and capability of each reconfigurable component.

If modules communicate using the IEEE 1394, A High-  Performance Serial Bus, interface, for example, this will be specified in the HID with  appropriate connector and pinout information. Any nonstandard protocols used should also be  specified. In some cases, this may be handled by the software HAL. Module interfaces will be  completely described, including any unused pins.  STRS-8) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the control,  telemetry, and data mechanisms of each modular component (i.e., how to program or control  each modular component of the platform, and how to use or access each device or software  component, noting any proprietary and nonstandard aspects).  esides the interface descriptions already provided for each modular component, developers  should provide specific information necessary for future STRS application developers to know  how to interact with the command and control aspects of the platform. The description of the  control, telemetry, and data mechanism of each modular component should facilitate the porting  of the application software to the platform.  he operating power interface description for the radio has two parts: (1) the platform as a  supplier to the various modules; and (2) the power consumption of the different modules, if  multiple modules are provided.               Table 2, Example\u2014Operating Power Interface (Platform Supplied), shows an example listing of  a platform operating power interface. There are four distinct sets of power requirements for the  platform shown. For each module delivered with the radio, as well as those built by other  vendors, the HID is to specify the needed voltages, currents, and connections. Voltages are to be  specified with a maximum and minimum tolerance, and associated currents are to be specified  with nominal and maximum values. Connectors for operating power are to be specified,  including pinouts. If power is routed through a multipurpose connector such as a backplane  connector, then the pins actually used are to be documented. Power is a limited commodity for  most missions, and understanding the STRS platform power needs is critical.

The power consumption may not be constant for each possible waveform that can  be loaded on the platform. The STRS platform provider should document the maximum allowable  power available and thermal dissipation of the FPGA(s) on the basis of the maximum allowable  thermal constraints of FPGA(s) of the platform. For human spaceflight environments, touch  temperature requirements may limit dissipation further; therefore, these reductions are to be  factored into the given dissipation limits.  STRS-108) The STRS platform provider shall describe, in the HID document, the thermal and  power limits of the hardware at the smallest modular level to which power is controlled.               s shown in Figure 7, Waveform Component Instantiation, an example STRS platform consists  of one or more GPMs with GPPs, and optionally one or more SPMs containing DSPs, FPGAs,  and ASICs. Application (waveform and service) components loaded and executed on these  modules provide the signal-processing algorithms necessary to generate or receive RF signals.  To aid portability and reusability, the applications are to use the appropriate infrastructure APIs  to access platform services. Using \u201cdirect to hardware\u201d access instead would increase the effort  to port the application to a platform with different hardware. The STRS infrastructure provides  the APIs and services necessary to load, verify, execute, change parameters, terminate, or  unload an application. The STRS infrastructure utilizes the HAL to abstract communications  with the specialized hardware, whereas the HID identifies the hardware interfaces and how  modules are physically integrated on a platform.      Signal  Data   STRS-10) An STRS application shall use the STRS infrastructure-provided APIs and POSIX\u00ae  API for access to platform resources.

The method for selecting the application will be a combination of the  platform\u2019s capabilities as well as the specification defined by the STRS Command and Telemetry  interfaces in section 8.  application-specific component. An application-specific configuration file specifies information  used to initialize an STRS application. It is up to the project manager/platform provider to  decide whether either of these is defined and, if so, what the format is. Suggestions are discussed  in the STRS Handbook, NASA-HDBK-4009A.     reliable and reusable applications require good coding practices, good documentation, and  thorough testing. The documentation and application artifacts are to be submitted to the NASA  STRS Application Repository, https://strs.grc.nasa.gov/repository/. The use of the artifacts in the  NASA STRS Application Repository will be subject to the appropriate license agreements.  Therefore, the agreements defining the release, distribution, and ownership of the artifacts are to  be submitted to the repository including license agreements, type of release, and any restrictions.  Types of releases are discussed in NPR 2210.1, Release of NASA Software. NASA will provide  the STRS application developer information on the requests and distribution of items and lessons  learned using the application. If the STRS application developer receives independent requests  for the application, this request should be forwarded to the NASA STRS Application Repository  manager to assure process consistency.     he goal of the NASA STRS Application Repository is to reduce future application development  time and porting time since STRS application developers will have access to validated code. The  STRS Application Repository is an archive of the developed configurable hardware design and  software for the various applications. The repository allows STRS application developers access  to existing STRS application artifacts that have been populated by NASA and STRS application  developers. The documentation of STRS application behavior should include the STRS  application developer\u2019s implementation of the STRS Application-provided Application Control  API methods as described in section 7.3.1.  The documentation can also include a Design Description Document, HID, HAL, Verification  and Validation (V&V) Plan, V&V Procedure, and V&V Results, OE-Specific Developer\u2019s Guide  and User\u2019s Guide.  (STRS-12) The following application or OE development artifacts shall be submitted to the  NASA STRS Application Repository:                  Application (or OE) or system component software and configurable  hardware design simulation model(s) and/or documentation.

(OE-Specific  Developer\u2019s Guide)  Configurable hardware design is distinguished from software residing in a GPP, ease depends  on OS/OE. This section addresses the use of configurable hardware design from design and  development through testing and verification and operations. It addresses aspects of model-  based design techniques and design for space environment applications.   roper testing of configurable hardware design is critical in the development of reliable and  reusable code. Development tools that enable early development and testing should be used so  that problems can be identified and resolved early in the SDR life cycle. Many real-world signal  degradations and SEUs can be simulated to identify potential issues with the waveform and  waveform functions early in development, even before hardware is available. Applications  implemented in configurable hardware should be modular with clear interfaces to enable  individual application component simulations and incremental testing.  he configurable hardware design architecture supports the modeling of STRS applications  implemented in configurable hardware at the system, subsystem, and function levels. Model-  based design techniques aid in the development of modular application functions. Application  development models done in a platform (or target) independent manner aid in application  testing, reuse, and portability. A platform-independent model (PIM) design can be used to target  different platforms. PIM design flows might include high level models combined with manual  code writing. On resource-constrained platforms, optimized code would be written. On non-  resource-constrained platforms, PIMs may be used to auto generate code. These design flows  can be employed to significantly reduce the porting effort.  from concept to implementation to testing. The coding technique of the application is also  essential to reduce the application porting effort. Having defined syntax standards for HDLs  (e.g., Verilog or VHDL) makes them appear to be easily portable across devices and software  synthesizers, but this is an incorrect assumption. There are many things that can make hardware  description languages hard to port. For example, the use of device-specific fixed hardware logic  on the FPGA will decrease the portability. The use of specialized hardware may be necessary to  meet the timing constraints of the application; however, the STRS application developer should  document any application function that uses the specialized hardware so that the effort to port              the application function(s) can be determined. Non-boolean-type logic such as clock generation  can also reduce portability. One method to decrease the porting effort would be to create a  module that does the clock generation from which the rest of the application functions receive  the necessary clock(s).  evelopment of configurable hardware design for STRS radios should include provisions for  mitigating space environmental effects such as SEUs. Near-term application of static random  access memory (SRAM)-based FPGAs may require triple-mode redundancy (TMR),  configuration memory scrubbing, and other mitigation techniques, depending on the intended  mission environment and desired reliability. Commercial design tools are becoming available to  aid in this process and some newer FPGAs have versions available with embedded TMR.  A key feature of SDRs is that they can be reconfigured after deployment. The ability to load new  applications and services will benefit missions in several ways, including using one SDR (instead  of several separate radios) to handle different applications for various phases of a mission, some  planned and some unplanned. An STRS platform should receive STRS application software and  configurable hardware design updates after deployment.  tandardizing and documenting the interface from the waveform applications on the GPP to the  portion of the waveform in the specialized processing hardware, such as FPGAs, is intended to  provide commonality among different STRS platforms and to aid portability of application  functional components implemented in configurable hardware design. Figure 8, Notional High-  Level Software and Configurable Hardware Design Waveform Application Interfaces, depicts  the high-level interface relationship between GPM, SPM, and RFM modules in an STRS radio.               Figure 8\u2014Notional High-Level Software and Configurable Hardware Design  Waveform Application Interfaces   and execute the software and configurable hardware design applications on various platforms  using different hardware devices. Reconfiguration may include changing the parameters of  installed applications and uploading new applications after deployment.  he application accepts configuration and control commands from the GPM and uses STRS  APIs or POSIX\u00ae APIs that interface to the device drivers associated with the SPM and RFM  modules. The device drivers communicate via the HAL on the GPM that abstracts the physical  interface specification described in the HID in transferring command and data information  between the modules.  platform-specific wrapper accepts command and data information from the GPM and provides  them to the application. The platform-specific wrapper also abstracts details of the platform  from the STRS application developer, such as pinout information. The platform-specific wrapper  should also provide clock generation, signal registering, and synchronization functions, and any  other non-waveform-specific functions that the platform requires.                Documentation of the platform-specific wrapper is necessary so that STRS application  developers can interface applications to the platform. This documentation should include  detailed timing constraints, such as signal hold times, minimum pulse widths, and duty cycles.  The signal timing constraints refer to the protocol of a particular interface describing events  happening on a particular clock cycle. For clock generation, one should document what clock  domains are in the design, how each clock is generated, and the resources that are involved.  Signal synchronization describes any additional logic needed when clock domains are changed  across the interface. The signal registering methods refer to any configurable hardware design  interfaces between modules and if the input and output were registered, latched, or neither.  (STRS-13) If the STRS application has a component resident outside the GPM (e.g., in  configurable hardware design), then the component shall be controllable from the STRS OE.  (STRS-14) The STRS SPM developer shall provide a platform-specific wrapper for each user-  programmable FPGA, which performs the following functions:    (2) Provides the platform-specific pinout for the STRS application developer. This  may be a complete abstraction of the actual FPGA pinouts with only waveform  application signal names provided.  (STRS-15) The STRS SPM developer shall provide documentation on the configurable hardware  design interfaces of the platform-specific wrapper for each user-programmable FPGA, which  describes the following:  development environment on which to construct NASA space applications. The breadth of this  goal implies that the specification be based on the following: (1) Core interfaces that allow  flexibility in the development of application software; and (2) HIDs that enable technology  infusion.     (1) Signal names and descriptions.  (2) Signal polarity, format, and data type.  (3) Signal direction.  (4) Signal-timing constraints.  (5) Clock generation and synchronization methods.  (6) Signal-registering methods.  (7) Identification of development tool set used.  (8) Any included noninterface functionality.                  an STRS-compliant radio. The model illustrates the different software elements used in the  software execution and defines the software interface layers between applications and the OE  and the interface between the OE and the hardware platform.     other and their separation from each other which enables developers to implement the layers  differently according to their needs while still complying with the architecture.         board support packages and device drivers, the abstraction of hardware languages or  configurable hardware design is less defined. The model represents the software and  configurable hardware design abstraction in this layer.  Standard provides two primary interface definitions, as follows: (1) The STRS APIs; and (2) The  STRS HAL specification, each with a control and data plane specification for interchanging  configuration and run-time data. The STRS APIs provide the interfaces that allow applications to  be instantiated and use platform services. These APIs also enable communication between  application components. The HAL specification describes the physical and logical interfaces for  intermodule and intramodule integration.                   applications, services, and communication equipment to interoperate in meeting an application  specification. Figure 10, STRS Layered Structure in UML, represents a view of the platform OE  that depicts the boundaries between the STRS infrastructure provided by the STRS platform  provider and the components that can be developed by third-party vendors (e.g., waveform  applications and services).   dependencies on the infrastructure that take advantage of explicit knowledge of the  infrastructure implementation. When waveforms and services conform to the API specification,  they are easier to port to other STRS platform implementations.    to include additional detail of the infrastructure, POSIX\u00ae-conformant OS, and hardware  platform. The STRS Software Execution Model (Figure 9) was transformed using the Unified  Modeling Language (UML). The UML supports the description of the software systems using an  object-oriented style. This approach clarifies the interfaces between components, adding  additional detail. Table 3, STRS Architecture Subsystem Key, provides a key that describes the  interaction between elements of the architecture.                                        aggregate A. B does not exist independently from A.  X may be a number or a range from m to n depicted  by \u201cm...n\u201d where n may be an asterisk to indicate no  upper limit.  Generalization  or  Inheritance  B is derived from A. B is a kind of A. B inherits all  the properties of A. A is a more general case of B.  Since B is more specialized, it frequently contains  some additional attributes and/or more functionality  than A.   C is an interface provided by B; that is, C contains the  means to invoke behavior that resides in B. A uses  interface C to access B.   \u201cuses\u201d indicates that A is associated with B such that  A \u201cuses\u201d B.    igure 11, STRS Operating Environment, describes the elements of the detailed OE depicted in  Figure 9. In the case that the OS does not support the POSIX\u00ae subset, the missing functionality  is to be implemented in the STRS infrastructure. Figure 11 also illustrates the inclusion of a  POSIX\u00ae abstraction layer in the infrastructure. As a note, this abstraction is not only for a non-  POSIX\u00ae OS, but the POSIX\u00ae abstraction layer would implement any POSIX\u00ae functions  required but not implemented by the OS.  n Figure 11 the arrows identify interface dependencies and isolations. The waveform  applications will not directly call the driver API but use the provided STRS APIs, thus providing  the \u201cabstraction layer\u201d that helps isolate the application from the platform.                      n Table 4, STRS Software Component Descriptions, the different layers of the STRS software  model are described.

The STRS infrastructure implements the behavior and functionality  identified by the STRS APIs as well as other required radio  functionality.  The STRS APIs provides consistent interfaces for the STRS  infrastructure to control applications and services, and for the  applications and services to access STRS infrastructure services.  The APP API is the interface implemented by waveforms and  services whose functions are used by the STRS infrastructure.  This optional interface (see Figure 12, POSIX\u00ae-Compliant Versus  POSIX\u00ae-Conformant OS) provides POSIX\u00ae OS services to the  waveform application and services on platforms with an OS that does  not provide POSIX\u00ae interfaces.      telemetry for the STRS. Applications use the STRS interface to  communicate telemetry and receive commands from flight computer.  The HAL provides the device control interfaces that are responsible  for all access to the hardware devices in the STRS radio. The HAL  API is the interface to the software drivers and BSP that  communicates with the hardware.  The STRS defines a minimum POSIX\u00ae application environment  profile (AEP) for the allowed OS services. The POSIX\u00ae AEP can be  implemented by either a POSIX\u00ae-conformant OS or by a POSIX\u00ae  Abstraction Layer in conjunction with a nonconformant OS.  This is the operating system that supports the POSIX\u00ae API and other  OS services. The POSIX\u00ae Abstraction Layer will provide  applications with a consistent AEP interface that is mapped into the  chosen OS functions.  This is the STRS POSIX\u00ae AEP-conformant portion of the OS.  POSIX\u00ae OS  Direct service support This layer identifies the ability for the STRS infrastructure to have a   Registered OS  services  Driver API  direct interface to the hardware drivers on the platform.  The hardware drivers provide the platform independence to the  software and infrastructure by abstracting the physical hardware  interfaces into a consistent device control API.  These are services that are integrated with the chosen OS to provide  services such as MAC-layer interface to physical Ethernet hardware.  OS-supplied APIs are abstracted from applications via the device  control API.          Layer  BSP  HW I/O interfaces  GPM   Description  The BSP is the software that implements the device drivers and parts  of the kernel for a specific piece of hardware. It provides the  hardware abstraction of the GPM module for the POSIX\u00ae-compliant  OS. A BSP contains source files, binary files, or both. A BSP  contains an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) adaptation layer  (OAL), which includes a boot loader for initializing the hardware and  loading the OS image. Essentially, the OAL is all of the software that  is hardware specific. The OAL is actually compiled and linked into  the embedded OS.  Device drivers have been created for these physical interfaces.  This is the general-purpose processing module on which the STRS  infrastructure executes.  igure 12 illustrates the difference between a POSIX\u00ae-conformant OS and a nonconformant  OS. On the left side, the POSIX\u00ae AEP is provided entirely by the OS. The POSIX\u00ae APIs are  included in those for the OS. On the right side, the OS is not POSIX\u00ae AEP conformant but is  partially compliant. The POSIX\u00ae AEP is shown in two parts. One part shows the POSIX\u00ae APIs  that are included in the OS. The other part shows the part of the POSIX\u00ae AEP that is not  provided by the OS but is to be provided as the POSIX\u00ae abstraction layer. The STRS OE  includes a POSIX\u00ae PSE51-conformant OS or POSIX\u00ae abstraction layer for missing APIs.                    he STRS infrastructure is part of the OE and provides the functionality for the interfaces  defined by the STRS APIs specification. The infrastructure exposes a standard set of method  names to the applications to facilitate portability. Although the STRS infrastructure may use any  combination of POSIX\u00ae, OS, BSP functions, or other infrastructure methods to implement a  radio function, which may vary on different platforms, the STRS APIs will be the same to allow  portability. The STRS APIs are the well-defined set of interfaces used by STRS applications to  access specific radio functions or used by the infrastructure to control the applications.  functionality to operate the radio. The components shown in Figure 13, STRS Infrastructure,  represent the high-level subsystems and services needed to control STRS applications within the  STRS platform. These services are provided by the platform infrastructure and support  applications as they execute within the STRS platform. The infrastructure functions will include  fault management techniques, which are necessary to increase radio robustness and support  mission-dependent requirements. In order to support one of the primary objectives of the STRS  (upgradeability), an STRS platform should be able to receive updated versions of the OE to  support applications developed for newer versions of this NASA Technical Standard, after  deployment.                     develop STRS applications. The goal is to have a standard API available to cover all application  program requirements so that the application programs can be reused on other hardware  systems with minimal porting effort and cost for the application implemented in software and/or  configurable hardware design with increased reliability. Size, weight, and power constraints  may limit the functionality of the radio by imposing a tradeoff among the following: (1) The size  of the API implementation; (2) The size of other internal operations; and (3) The size of the  waveforms and services. The size of the selected GPP should be sufficient to contain the OS, the  STRS infrastructure, and the appropriate portion of the waveforms and services to implement the  required mission functionality, along with sufficient margin to support software upgrades. The  STRS APIs are defined to support internal radio commands. The external interface commands,  described in section 9, often use the internal commands defined by the STRS APIs to accomplish  normal radio operations.     he API layer specification decouples the intellectual property rights of platform, application,  and module developers. The API layer allows development and interoperability of different radio  aspects while protecting the investment of the developers. The definitions of the APIs are based  on a set of sequence diagrams derived from the use cases identified in Appendix A of the  NASA/TP-2008-214813, STRS Software Architecture Concepts and Analysis, document.  he APIs are defined in the following sections. The APIs are grouped by type to simplify the  description of the APIs while providing the detail for each requirement in tabular form. The  table contains the name, description, calling sequence, return type, any preconditions, any post  conditions, and examples. The examples shown in the table for each requirement are written  from the point of view of the STRS application developer. The calling sequences for the  infrastructure-provided APIs are callable from C language implementations of the STRS  applications. If coding is done in C++, the infrastructure-provided API methods do not belong  to any class and should be defined using extern \u201cC.\u201d   STRS-105) The STRS infrastructure APIs shall have an ISO/IEC C language compatible  interface.    key aspect of a software-architecture is the definition of the APIs that are used to facilitate  software configuration and control of the target platform. The philosophy on which the STRS  architecture is based avoids the conflict between open architecture and proprietary  implementations by specifying a minimum set of APIs that are used to execute waveform  applications and to deliver data and control messages to installed hardware components. The  following APIs exhibit similar functionality to a resource interface in the Object Management            s shown in Figure 14, STRS Application and Device Structure, an STRS application  implementation (e.g., waveform) is derived from the STRS_ApplicationControl API, the  STRS_Source API when implementing APP_Read, and the STRS_Sink API when implementing  APP_Write. The interfaces are implemented in groups so that STRS_ApplicationControl is  derived from the STRS_LifeCycle, STRS_PropertySet, STRS_TestableObject,  STRS_ControllableComponent, and STRS_ComponentIdentifier interfaces.

STRS requires a C and C++ standard based on ISO/IEC 9899, Information technology\u2014  Programming languages\u2014C, and ISO/IEC 14882, Information technology\u2014Programming  languages\u2014C++, respectively. In the USA, this is INCITS/ISO/IEC 9899:year and  INCITS/ISO/IEC 14882:year, respectively, where the year will change periodically. The year is               not included in the requirement so that obsolete compilers are not mandated. In the USA, the  InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) coordinates technical  standards activity between American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the USA and joint  ISO/IEC committees worldwide. INCITS is not included in the requirement so that the country of  implementation may use its compilers.

OE developer: usually platform provider  he STRS applications use the STRS Infrastructure Messaging methods to establish messages  passing facilities to send messages between components using a single handle ID. The ability for  applications, services, devices, or files to communicate with other STRS applications, services,  devices, or files is crucial for the separation of radio functionality among independent  asynchronous components. For example, the receive and transmit telecommunication  functionalities can be separated between two applications. Another example is when commands  or log messages come from several independent sources and have to be merged appropriately.  Some examples of independent components that probably need to interact with others could be  for navigation, GPS, file upload, file download, and computations (even nonradio). The STRS  radio is essentially a computer, and it has capabilities that make the whole spacecraft system  more robust. The final destination of a message is not necessarily known to the producer of the  message.  messages are written to a First-In First_Out (FIFO) queue by one entity and read from the FIFO  queue by another entity. In a Pub/Sub, messages written to the message passing facility by one  application are delivered to all subscribers of that publisher. Therefore, the Pub/Sub messaging  API should be implemented using a form of the Publish-Subscribe design pattern. To read from a  queue, STRS_Read is used. To write to a message passing facility, STRS_Write is used.  STRS_Read and STRS_Write provide a portable means for the applications to use message  passing facility.   pecific predefined message passing facility handle identification/identifiers (IDs) denoted by  STRS_ERROR_QUEUE, STRS_FATAL_QUEUE, and STRS_WARNING_QUEUE are required.  The STRS_Log method uses these special-purpose handle IDs to log errors.   (STRS-76) The STRS infrastructure shall contain a callable STRS_FileRename method as  described in Table 57, STRS_FileRename().

Although nanoseconds  are the units obtained by STRS_GetNanoseconds, that does not imply that the resolution is  nanoseconds or that the underlying STRS_TimeWarp object contains its data in nanoseconds.  For example, the underlying STRS_TimeWarp object could count ticks from some epoch and  then STRS_GetSeconds and STRS_GetNanoseconds compute the seconds and nanoseconds from  the same or a different epoch. These timers are expected to be used for relatively low accuracy  timing such as time stamps, timed events, and time constraints.

Corporation\u2019s (DEC\u2019s) OpenVMS\u2122 (Virtual Memory System) and Microsoft Windows NT\u00ae.  However, the creation of POSIX\u00ae is closely coupled to the UNIX\u00ae OS and its evolution. The  goal was to create a standard set of interfaces that all of the UNIX\u00ae flavors would support in  order to facilitate software portability. Even though POSIX\u00ae technically refers to the family of  specifications, it is more commonly used to refer specifically to IEEE 1003.1, Information  Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX\u00ae), which is the core POSIX\u00ae  specification.   a. Application-oriented.  b. Interface, not implementation.  c. Source, not object, portability.  d. The C-language/system interfaces written in terms of the ISO C standard.  e.

Minimal changes to historical implementations.  i. Minimal changes to existing application code.   series of amendments addressed the unique requirements of real-time computing. These  amendments follow:     he subset of the POSIX\u00ae API described below is used by STRS applications to access platform  services when no STRS Infrastructure-provided API is available. POSIX\u00ae was chosen as part of  this NASA Technical Standard because it defines an open-standard OS interface and  environment to support application portability. However, because of the limited resources on a  space-based platform, it was not practical to support the entire IEEE 1003.1 specification.  a. IEEE 1003.1B-Realtime Extension.  b. IEEE 1003.1C-Threads Extension.  c. IEEE 1003.1D-Additional Realtime Extensions.  d. IEEE 1003.1J-Advanced Realtime Extensions.  e. IEEE 1003.1Q-Tracing.               The IEEE 1003.1 standard provides a means to implement a subset of the interfaces by using  \u201cSubprofiling Option Groups.\u201d These option groups specify \u201cUnits of Functionality\u201d that can be  removed from the base POSIX\u00ae specification.  EEE 1003.13 created four AEPs that specified subsets of 1003.1 more suitable to embedded  applications. These profiles follow:  \u2022 PSE51\u2014Minimal Realtime Systems Profile.  \u2022 PSE52\u2014Realtime Controller System Profile.  \u2022 PSE53\u2014Dedicated Realtime System Profile.  \u2022 PSE54\u2014Multi-Purpose Realtime System Profile.   ach of these profiles has increasing capabilities, which increase requirements on resources.  Profiles 51 and 52 runs on a single processor with no Memory Management Unit (MMU), and  thus imply a single process containing one or more threads. Profile 52 adds a file system  interface and asynchronous I/O. Profile 53 adds support for multiple processes, thus requiring  an MMU. The last and largest profile 54 adds support for interactive users, and is almost a full-  he profiles are each upwardly compatible and consist of the basic building blocks shown in  Figure 15,1 Profile Building Blocks.                          locking, for profiles PSE51 and PSE52. Even though there is no MMU support on the PSE51 and  PSE52 profiles, code written as if there is an MMU present will be portable among all four  profiles by requiring such APIs to be defined in all four profiles. The signature of these APIs will  be identical on all profiles, but the functionality will differ according to the capabilities. For  example, calling a memory-locking API on a PSE51 platform with no MMU will always return  success. When this example application is ported to a PSE53 platform, the memory locking will  work as intended without modification to the source code.  blown POSIX\u00ae 1003.1 environment. The higher numbered profiles are supersets of the lower  numbered profiles, such that PSE52 includes all the features of a PSE51.    PSE54, although PSE54 will only be used for development platforms and ground stations.  Allowing multiple profiles allows the architecture to scale with mission class. Applications  developed for a specific profile are compatible with higher profiles; that is, a profile 52  application could be ported to profile PSE53 and PSE54 platform, but not vice versa. This  upward scalability anticipates that smaller platforms will desire smaller profiles and will not  have the resources to run larger applications that comply with the larger profiles. Appendix A  provides a table comparing the POSIX\u00ae profile functionality for subset PSE51 through PSE53.  STRS-90) The STRS OE shall provide the interfaces described in POSIX\u00ae standard IEEE  1003.13 profile PSE51.  or constrained-resource platforms with limited software evolutionary capability, where the  waveform signal processing is implemented in specialized hardware, the supplier may request a  waiver to only implement a subset of POSIX\u00ae PSE51 as required by the portion of the  waveforms residing on the GPP. The applications created for this platform are to be upward-  compatible to a larger platform containing POSIX\u00ae PSE51. The POSIX\u00ae API is grouped into  units of functionality. If none of the applications for a constrained-resource platform use any of  the interfaces in a unit of functionality, then the supplier may request a waiver to eliminate that  entire unit of functionality.  egardless of the POSIX\u00ae profile implemented, applications are not to use any restricted  functions or their equivalent, such as abort(), atexit(), exit(), calloc(), free(), malloc(), or  realloc(). For portability of application code to multithreaded STRS platforms, STRS  applications are to use the thread-safe versions of the POSIX\u00ae methods listed in Table 77,  Replacements for Unsafe Functions.

Communications over a network use a layered network  model. TCP/IP is the protocol that is used to transport information over the Internet, and the  TCP/IP network model consists of five layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the  network layer, the data link layer, and the physical network.       systems perform simultaneous application processing in dedicated hardware at the very fast  speeds to which users have become accustomed. Any change in this environment is to equal or  exceed previous performance for it to be considered for usage. As such, the proposal to perform  application processing via software modules executing on a GPP involves careful consideration  of both the necessary OS characteristics and the application processing requirements. In a  simplistic sense, a computer OS manages the usage and sharing of resources between competing  users (i.e., tasks) to perform work. In this case, each task is performing a specific instance of  application processing. When the OS decides to stop the execution of one task and start another,  the current context of the machine (register values, instruction pointers, etc.) is to be saved and  then switched to accommodate the requirements of the new task. On a desktop computer system,  context switching between competing tasks is performed on an ad-hoc basis with no guarantee of  task execution. For most missions, this is unacceptable because context switching between  execution threads and deterministic thread execution are the driving characteristics for an OS.   purpose OS. An RTOS provides the capabilities of fast, low overhead for context switching, and  a deterministic scheduling mechanism so that processing constraints can be achieved when  required.   configured and scaled down to fit into the executable image of the STRS system. A modern RTOS  is primarily designed for either performance (monolithic kernel) or extensibility (microkernel).  Monolithic kernels have tightly integrated services and less run-time overhead but are not easily  extensible. Microkernels have somewhat high run-time overheads but are highly extensible. Most  modern RTOSs are microkernels, and although modern microkernels have more overhead than  monolithic kernels, they have less overhead than traditional microkernels. The run-time  overhead of modern RTOSs is decreased by reducing the unnecessary context switch. Important  timings such as context switch time, interrupt latency, and semaphore get and release latency is  to be kept to a minimum.              interfaces. The HAL allows specialized hardware to be integrated with the GPM so that the  STRS OE can access functions implemented on the specialized hardware of the STRS platform.   Examples of functionality that a HAL might need to support include boot code for initializing the  hardware and loading the OS image, context switch code, configuration and access to hardware  resources. The HAL is commonly referred to by platform vendors as drivers or BSPs. Most  companies already provide such libraries to allow use of specialized hardware. This layer  enables the STRS infrastructure to have a direct interface to the hardware drivers on the  platform.    a. STRS-11 requires a HAL software API, which defines the physical and logical  interfaces for intermodule and intramodule integration. The HAL is required for communicating  data and control information between the GPP and the specialized hardware. The HAL API is  not currently defined in this NASA Technical Standard but is left for the STRS platform provider  to specify.  calling sequence, the return values, an explanation of the functionality, preconditions for using  the method, postconditions after using the method, and examples where helpful. Note that the  delivery of the HAL source code is not required.   STRS platform provider in the HID. Information on a module\u2019s use of data in the HID will be  made available to STRS application developers, either directly from the manufacturer (for  specific types of components) or from the STRS platform provider (for memory maps based on  electrical connections). The infrastructure or HAL may use this information to appropriately  initialize hardware drivers such that control and data messages are delivered to the module.  ven though there is not a requirement for the STRS OE to be portable, the HAL is expected to  foster portability and reusability of the STRS infrastructure and specialized hardware in different  combinations from that originally designed. It can reduce the design efforts otherwise necessary  to adapt the software to a new hardware platform. The goal with the HAL is to make it easier to  change or add new hardware and to minimize the impact to the software. It does this by  localizing the differences in software so that most of the STRS OE code does not need to be  changed to run on a new platform or a platform with a new module.  STRS-92) The STRS platform provider shall provide the STRS platform HAL documentation  that includes the following:                 (1) For each method or function, its calling sequence, return values, an explanation of  its functionality, any preconditions for using the method or function, and the  postconditions after using the method or function.  (2) Information required to address the underlying hardware, including the interrupt  input and output, the memory mapping, and the configuration data necessary to  operate in the STRS platform environment.

The STRS radio implements an external interface to receive and act on the commands  from the external system, translates the commands into the format expected by the application,  and provides the information for monitoring the health and status of the radio. If the STRS radio  has the capability for new or modified OE, application software, or configurable hardware  design, the external command and telemetry interfaces should be able to accept and store new  files. The interface in the STRS radio and in the external system, which is to provide the control,  via a command sequence, to the STRS radio and receive responses from an STRS radio, is  referred to as the STRS command and telemetry interfaces. The external STRS command and  telemetry functionality illustrated in Figure 16, Command and Telemetry Interfaces, typically  resides on the spacecraft\u2019s flight computer, and/or it may reside on a ground station or another  spacecraft.     functions. Within the STRS radio, if there are data stored on the radio that are to be transferred  to an external system, the capability is to exist to send data using a mission-specific protocol to  the receiver (flight computer, ground station, or other spacecraft) and capability in the receiver  to process those data or write those data to a file or download service or to a storage area that is  accessible from both. The reverse capability for STRS radio control is also necessary: The  external system is capable of sending commands using a mission-specific protocol and the STRS  radio is capable of validating, deciphering, and processing those commands. For example, data  coming over the Flight Computer Interface are interpreted by the Command and Control  Manager as shown in Figure 13 and are processed by the STRS infrastructure.   Within the STRS radio, components of the command and telemetry interfaces are necessary to  provide the interfaces between the STRS OE and the STRS command and telemetry functionality  on the external system. The command and telemetry interfaces may include a standard type of               mechanical, electrical, and functional spacecraft bus interface, such as MIL\u2013STD\u20131553, Digital  Time Division Command/Response Multiplex Data Bus; command and telemetry interpretation;  and translation of the command set to the STRS standard necessary for application control. The  protocol, command set, and telemetry set for the STRS command and telemetry interfaces are  NOT part of the STRS standard but can be unique to each mission. A number of interface and  behavior requirements are part of the standard to support the mission-specific protocols.    STRS-95) An STRS platform shall execute external application control commands using the  standardized STRS APIs.  STRS-107) An STRS platform provider shall document the external commands describing their  format, function, and any STRS methods invoked.  STRS-96) The STRS infrastructure shall use the STRS_Query method to service external  system requests for information and to provide telemetry data about an STRS application.       b.

Table 79\u2014Suggested Services Implemented by the  STRS Command and Telemetry Interfaces              This command requests that the STRS radio instantiate the application  and facilitate the installation of devices and resources requested by the  application. This service should not impact existing applications. The  command arguments will include the application ASCII handle name and  string used to identify the application for instantiation.  This command requests a customization of the application by specifying  parameters the application will use.  This command requests the current parameters and operational values of  the application.  This command requests that an initialized application begin processing  application data. If the application has not been selected or completed  initialization, the command will be rejected.  This command requests that a running application halt processing of  application data. The application resources are not deallocated.  This command requests that the STRS infrastructure unload the identified  application and release all resources associated with the application.   This request will initiate an upload of a file to the STRS radio and place  it in a specified location. If the command gets an error, the reason will be  made available.  This is a request for the deletion of a specified file from an STRS  platform.  This request is complementary to the Upload File Request. This  command will initiate a download of a specified file from the STRS  platform.    This request will perform a commanded built-in-test used to monitor the  health of the radio and diagnose any problems.    Several different telemetry structure definitions may exist for different  classes of STRS radios. Many systems will employ a polling technique  where the data are provided only upon request. Other systems may desire  a grouping of telemetry that can be identified to be sent at some periodic  rate.
