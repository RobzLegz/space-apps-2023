Administrative/editorial changes were  made to conform to the current NASA  Technical Handbook template.                    This NASA Technical Handbook is published by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA) as a guidance document to provide engineering information; lessons  learned; possible options to address technical issues; classification of similar items, materials, or  processes; interpretive direction and techniques; and any other type of guidance information that  may help the Government or its contractors in the design, construction, selection, management,  support, or operation of systems, products, processes, or services.  his NASA Technical Handbook is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers and Facilities. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, other contractors,  recipients of grants and cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the  extent specified or referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.  his NASA Technical Handbook establishes guidelines for specifying and certifying wrought  titanium (Ti) alloys for use on NASA Flight Projects for organizations buying such materials.      his NASA Technical Handbook does not cover commercially pure Ti since it is not considered  a nonconforming issue because of its lack of sensitivity to heat treating and thermo-mechanical  processing.  supply chain. It recommends the involvement of certain technical disciplines to ascertain  whether there is nonconformance and also approaches to monitor and assure compliance of  procured materials with the relevant procurement specifications. As of the date of publication of  this NASA Technical Handbook, there is no known evidence of nonconforming Ti alloy issues  with foreign sources. The same guideline procedures described in this NASA Technical  Handbook should be used for foreign Ti alloy sources and foreign contractors. Ti alloys can be  procured from a foreign source by a United States (U.S.) or foreign entity associated with a  NASA program. The basic issues addressed in this NASA Technical Handbook apply whether  the Ti alloy is of U.S. or foreign source.  timeframe of 2008-2010, significant issues (and incurred costs) were encountered through the  investigations of multiple Government agencies with respect to nonconforming Ti alloys. Note:  the exclusion of other metals in this document is not meant to indicate that no problems can or                 will occur with other metals. Organizations procuring other metallic and nonmetallic materials  for flight applications should use due diligence to ensure such materials meet the requirements  for specifications used in the procurement process.  his NASA Technical Handbook focuses on product forms referred to as sheet, strip, plate,  forging, and bar, i.e., forms covered by the American Materials Specifications (AMSs) that  supersede MIL-T-9046, Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Sheet, Strip, and Plate, and MIL-T-9047,  Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Bars (Rolled or Forged) and Reforging Stock, Aircraft Quality,  and that are primarily related to the nonconforming Ti alloy issue. The other AMS specifications  covering product forms such as tubing, casting, extruded parts, or fasteners are not implicated in  the nonconforming Ti alloy issue.  equests for information should be submitted via \u201cFeedback\u201d at https://standards.nasa.gov.

These guidelines  may be tailored to the program applications to obtain the most cost-effective, best quality  product.   his NASA Technical Handbook is applicable to NASA Centers and NASA programs utilizing  wrought Ti alloys for flight hardware, mission-critical ground support equipment, and elements  thereof.  his NASA Technical Handbook is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA  Centers and Facilities. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) or to other  contractors, grant recipients, or parties to agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in  their contracts, grants, or agreements.  his NASA Technical Handbook, or portions thereof, may be referenced in contract, program,  and other Agency documents for guidance.

Handbook. Government specifications were originally developed and subsequently transformed  from military specifications to non-Government standard documents, such as the Aerospace  Materials Specifications (AMSs) for Ti alloys commercially available now. These specifications  have documented processing requirements and well-established minimum property values for  various product forms.   completeness, the following two Ti alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn, are the two primary  alloys of interest. Most of the investigations into potential nonconforming Ti alloys occurred in  the mid to late 2000s and were centered on these two alloys. United States Air Force (USAF)  investigations into nonconforming Ti alloys first addressed Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn and, subsequently in  the late 2000s, included Ti-6Al-4V. NASA investigations, predominately in the late 2000s,  focused on Ti-6Al-4V, as this alloy had the most flight applications by a large number. However,  the procedures and processes described in this document can be applied to other Ti alloys.  Commercially pure Ti is generally not considered an issue because of its lack of sensitivity to  heat treating and thermo-mechanical processing.    he two original military documents for Ti and Ti alloys (MIL-T-9046, Titanium and Titanium  Alloy, Sheet, Strip, and Plate, and MIL-T-9047, Titanium and Titanium Alloy, Bars (Rolled or  Forged) and Reforging Stock, Aircraft Quality) have been replaced by approximately 55 AMS  non-Government standards. ASTM International (ASTM, formerly the American Society for  Testing and Materials) specifications are not listed in this NASA Technical Handbook because  of a shortfall of aerospace quality procurement requirements. However, a Center could utilize  ASTM specifications for non-flight applications and/or add additional requirements to the  procurement documents for flight applications.  .1.1 The latest issuances of cited documents shall apply unless specific versions are  designated.  .1.2 Non-use of specifically designated versions shall be approved by the responsible  Technical Authority.

MIL-T-9046 was issued on May 20, 1955, and encompassed Ti and Ti  alloy metal sheet, strip, and plate products. Both specifications were revised many times over  their years of use.

Therefore,  according to table 1, the applicable procurement specifications for Ti-6Al-4V annealed bars and  forgings and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn annealed bars and forgings are SAE AMS6931 and SAE AMS6936,  respectively.   hese two SAE AMS specifications have similar requirements to the last revised MIL-T-9047G,  Amendment 2. There is one divergence of interest with respect to maximum cross-sectional area  of tested material: SAE AMS6931 specifies minimum mechanical properties for stock with a  maximum cross-sectional area of 309.68 cm2 (48 in2) instead of 103.23 mm2 (16 in2) in MIL-T-  9047G, Amendment 2.

As indicated in table 2, applicable procurement specifications for Ti-6Al-4V  annealed sheet, strip, and plate and Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn annealed sheet, strip, and plate are SAE  AMS4911 and SAE AMS4918, respectively.  hese two AMS specifications have requirements similar to MIL-T-9046J, Amendment 2. In  addition, the latest SAE AMS4911 and SAE AMS4918 assert in section 3.3.2, \u201cPlate product  shall be produced using standard industry practices designed strictly for the production of plate  stock to the procured thickness. Bar, billet, forgings, or forging stock shall not be supplied in lieu  of plate.\u201d                 that might be relevant to procurement of Ti-6Al-4V material in the annealed condition,  specifically in bar and forging forms. SAE AMS4928 covers Ti-6Al-4V bars, wires, forgings,  rings, and drawn shapes in annealed condition. When compared with SAE AMS6931, which  superseded SAE AMS-T-9047, SAE AMS4928 does not specify any maximum cross-sectional  area of tested material nor does it specify macrostructure and ultrasonic inspection requirements.  SAE AMS4928 also allows a solution heat treatment (HT) in a mill-annealed material. This is  not permitted in any other mill-annealed specification. Solution HT increases strength at the  expense of fracture toughness. However, SAE AMS4928 has a more stringent requirement on  hydrogen content (maximum 125 ppm versus 150 ppm in SAE AMS6931) and higher tensile and  yield strength requirements for bars up to 50.8 mm (2 in) in thickness (931 MPa (135 ksi) and  862 MPa (125 ksi) versus 896 MPa (130 ksi) and 827 MPa (120 ksi) in SAE AMS6931).  Additional requirements can always be added to procurement documentation if this specification  needs to be utilized, thereby facilitating material purchased in accordance with this specification  to be acceptable for flight.  specifications, coupled with careful review of the certification data package, is required to assure  that material has been properly processed and certified.   material. However, this specification does not include requirements for microstructure,  macrostructure, and ultrasonic inspection and is not recommended for procurement of  aircraft-/space-quality Ti and Ti alloys for flight application without the use of additional  requirements to address noted shortfalls or performance of additional testing by procuring  organizations.       product begins as an ingot: in vacuum, a molten Ti alloy is allowed to solidify in a mold.  Example Ti alloy ingot diameters are 71.1 cm (28 in), 76.2 cm (30 in), and 91.4 cm (36 in).  he ingot is then typically hot worked in a forging press into the products referred to as billets,  slabs, or blocks. These partially forged, semi-finished materials are created as feedstock for final  processing. The semi-finished materials are intermediate products generally not intended for  finished products. Intermediate products require additional hot rolling, hot forging, or extruding  processes (also generally referred to as metallurgical working operations) to produce wrought  end-product shapes for aerospace applications. A typical fabrication process for aerospace-  quality wrought Ti alloy finished products is shown in figure 1, Fabrication Process of Wrought  Ti Alloys. (Figure 1 is modified from Calcaterra, 2009.)        The primary mill sources for ingots of Ti alloy in the U.S. include Allegheny Technologies  Incorporated (ATI) Allvac, RTI International (formerly Research Triangle Institute), and  Titanium Metals Corporation (Timet). These companies supply ingots to conversion houses that  forge and/or hot roll the ingot into intermediate products. Primary mill sources may also produce  intermediate or end-product forms.  xamples of end-product shapes intended for use in aerospace systems include bar (round or  rectangular), plate, sheet, strip, and wire. Some specifications also include a product form called  forging stock, which is the same as billet or intermediate product to be used for further  processing.  he complex microstructures of Ti alloys are developed from combined thermal-mechanical  processing of as-cast ingots through intermediate to the final product forms. The microstructure  and hence the mechanical properties of Ti alloys are dependent on the fabrication scheme and the  thermal history. Multiple cycles of work (heating, forging, rolling, and cooling) are required to  achieve the desired microstructure required for thin plate and sheet products used for flight  applications. Intermediate product forms may not have been worked sufficiently to produce the  microstructure necessary to achieve minimum acceptable specification-based mechanical  properties across the entire cross section. If, because of the size of a Ti alloy part to be  fabricated, intermediate product sizes such as billets of greater than 15.2 cm (6 in) thickness need  to be procured, the procuring organization can specify slightly lower minimum mechanical  properties than typical for thinner plate material. Based on information from USAF and JPL test  programs (discussed in sections 5.3.2 and 5.3.3 in this NASA Technical Handbook), only 5 to 10  percent reductions in tensile ultimate strength (Ftu) and tensile yield strength (Fty), respectively,  may be sufficient to bound the minimum mechanical properties of the billet material. However,  there are significant deviations in secondary properties. Specifically noteworthy are impacts to           fatigue and other dynamic mechanical properties, which are described further in section 5.3.2 of  this NASA Technical Handbook.  In addition to thermo-mechanical processing, Ti alloy mechanical properties are strongly  dependent on heat treatment. Ti-6Al-4V is commonly specified in either an annealed or an STA  condition. Annealing requires that the entire cross section be maintained at 704.4 \u00b0C (1,300 \u00b0F)  for 1 hour minimum, followed by furnace cooling, if maximum ductility, i.e., high percent  elongation and percent reduction of area at failure, is required. Note: Most specifications give a  temperature range with 704.4 \u00b0C (1,300 \u00b0F) as a minimum. Also, most specifications make a  reference to section thickness driving the time at temperature. SAE AMS-H-81200, Heat  Treatment of Titanium and Titanium Alloys, offers the following guidance in selecting soak  times:      annealed Ti 6Al-4V material are 827 MPa (120,000 psi) and 896 MPa (130,000 psi),  respectively. Carefully developed thermal processes exist for STA conditions. The resulting  effects of these thermal processes on minimum strength values as a function of plate thickness  can be seen in figure 2, Specification Minimum Strength Sensitivity of Ti-6Al-4V Sheet, Strip,  and Plate as a Function of Heat Treatment, Thickness, and Interstitial Element Level.  Figure 2\u2014 Specification Minimum Strength Sensitivity of Ti-6Al-4V Sheet, Strip, and Plate  as a Function of Heat Treatment, Thickness, and Interstitial Element Level              60  Wrought Material Dimension (mm)                                 Mills, conversion houses, or heat treatment shops use an acid treatment, referred to as pickling,  to remove the scale and/or an alpha case from material not heat treated in vacuum or suitable  inert gas environments. This etching process can be an issue regarding the generation of  hydrogen embrittlement; therefore, a hydrogen content determination test, e.g., in accordance  with ASTM E 1447, Standard Test Method for Determination of Hydrogen in Titanium and  Titanium Alloys by Inert Gas Fusion Thermal Conductivity/Infrared Detection Method, of final  products is required, and the test result should be included in the material certification package.  Also, because of the tendency of prestressed Ti alloys to crack while in contact with certain  chemical reagents, it is necessary to ensure that materials used during processing, testing, and  inspection, including ultrasonic couplants, will not initiate stress corrosion of titanium alloys.  ASTM F 945, Standard Test Method for Stress-Corrosion of Titanium Alloys by Aircraft Engine  Cleaning Materials, can be used for dealing with the contact material compatibility issue.   a \u201cplate product shall be produced using standard industry practices designed strictly for the  production of plate stock to the procured thickness. Bar, billet, forgings, or forging stock shall  not be supplied in lieu of plate.\u201d No matter whether the previous practice for any Ti alloy  supplier has included cutting down billet thicknesses, this practice is not standard.   be processed to the final thickness/diameter by metallurgical working operations. Bar shall not  be cut from plate. It is not allowed to cut a plate along its longitudinal direction and make a  bar. If cutting in the longitudinal direction is done, the product still needs to be identified as plate  stock. The customer may agree on the substitution, but the bar product from the plate stock  cannot be certified as bar stock. Cut strip from the plate without further thickness reductions is  acceptable, as noted above. However, it is important to maintain grain direction knowledge of  cut samples. In addition, it should be clear that cutting billet is permitted if the cut pieces are  subsequently hot or cold worked. This is a common industrial practice and completely  acceptable.    NASA organizations or associated contractors by material distributors or secondary processing  plants/companies, also referred to as conversion houses. For NASA flight program applications,  the use of an appropriate material specification as a part of the procurement process is standard  practice.   extrude) starting material into finished forms. Conversion houses have the in-house capability to  perform some or all of the standard hot-working operations. Starting material for conversion  houses may be referred to as forging stock, billet, or various other names. On the other hand,  most Ti alloy distributors have only capabilities to cut stock with low-speed band saws or high-  speed circular saws to meet size demands (different lengths and/or widths of a given thickness  plate) of customers. Neither low- nor high-speed cutting is considered to be a metallurgical  working operation or hot working.       A material distributor may place orders to build up internal stock from conversion houses for  finished products or procure intermediate products, e.g., billets or thick plate stock, or even  procure Ti alloy ingots directly from Ti alloy mills. These intermediate products and ingots  would subsequently be sent back out for hot working to meet a specific customer need. When an  ingot is hot worked, it is considered a wrought product. Wrought products are divided into  intermediate products and finished products. The thickness of wrought products is reduced  through the hot-working process. An ingot is considered a cast shape.   there is a part configuration issue, e.g., size/thickness, which precludes the use of finished  products. If the stock to be used is larger than what the specification allows/requires, it still  should be worked in the alpha-beta range to its final dimensions. Also, a purchaser needs to have  an agreement on the minimum non-specification-based mechanical properties. However, all of  the other specification requirements should apply. SAE AMS6931 and SAE AMS4911  specifications define what are considered finished plate and bar materials, respectively, and  describe how these products shall be processed. (See section 4.3 in this NASA Technical  Handbook.) Exceptions must be carefully dealt with by knowledgeable design, stress, and  materials/processing engineers or manufacturing engineering personnel so that the proper  minimum property values are used in the design, analysis, and verification activities.  he boundary size between billet and end product is alloy dependent. For example, Ti-6Al-6V-  2Sn is generally 20,645 mm2 (32 in2), Ti-6Al-4V is 309.68 cm2 (48 in2), and TI-6Al-4V ELI is  103.23 cm2 (16 in2). Intermediate product forms for Ti-6Al-4V, such as billets, are generally  considered to possess cross sections of greater than 309.68 cm2 (48 in2), but some specifications  are more stringent and stipulate that product forms with greater than 103.23 cm2 (16 in2) be  considered an intermediate product form. For example, ASTM B348 defines a billet as a solid  semi-finished section hot rolled or forged from an ingot with a cross-sectional area greater than  103.23 cm2 (16 in2) whose width is less than 5 times its thickness. SAE AMS6931 alternatively  requires a maximal cross-sectional area of 309.70 cm2 (48 in2) (with no stipulation for  relationship of width to thickness) of tested forging product instead of the original 103.23 cm2  (16 in2) maximum required by MIL-T-9047G, Amendment 2. The specification words referring  to \u201cof tested material\u201d are related to the requirement to extract mechanical test coupons, such as  tensile test coupons, from material that has less than the 309.68 cm2 (48 in2) cross section.   mechanical properties are a requirement, and if the material does not meet them, it can be  rejected. If the cross-sectional area is above the limit, then the mechanical properties are for  information only and cannot be used to reject the material, unless there is a pre-established  agreement between the procuring parties. While any size can be ordered, the procuring party  should be aware of when the specifications apply and when they do not.  s discussed in section 5.3.2 of this document, some data have emerged recently (AFRL-RX-  WP-TR-2012-0238, Quick Reaction Evaluation of Materials and Processes (QRE), tending to  show that barely acceptable tensile property values are attainable for semi-finished billets with  cross-sectional areas several times greater than 309.68 cm2 (48 in2). Caution is urged in this area  as the testing only represents large billets from one conversion house. On the other hand, the       USAF test program on large cross-sectional area billets indicated up to 70-percent knockdown in  fatigue life when compared with the control plate.  ntermediate product forms may not have been worked sufficiently to produce the microstructure  necessary to achieve minimum specification mechanical properties across the entire cross  section. It is possible, based on the above-mentioned extensive mechanical testing conducted by  the USAF, with some supporting evidence from JPL D-69922, Report of the Titanium Working  Group Concerning the Assessment of Non-Conforming Material as it Affects JPL Flight  Projects, that Ti-6Al-4V billet (unlike Ti-6AL-6V-2Sn material produced to USAF  requirements) can just meet the minimum mechanical values specified in AMS specifications for  plate material greater than 152 mm (6 in) thick. However, JPL has also performed mechanical  testing on suspected Ti-6AL-4V billet material provided as if the material was in a finished  product shape with relevant material certifications and found several lots of material that  exhibited mechanical properties just below minimum specification values. For example, out of  122 tensile test coupons made from 4 suspect lots of Ti-6Al-4V, 25 percent of test coupons failed  to meet the specified minimum tensile yield strength, 4 percent of coupons failed to meet the  minimum ultimate strength, and 53 percent of coupons failed to meet the minimum reduction in  area. These data are discussed further in section 5.3.3 in this NASA Technical Handbook.  distributors, conversion houses, or mills as part of standard procurement or acquisition processes.  In the case of procured finished products or parts, certification packages are supplied by the  vendors providing the finished parts. The certification package is to contain, as a minimum, the  information outlined in the material specification for finished material provided by a mill. In  addition, if material is processed by a conversion house, the original mill certification, the  conversion house certification, the heat treatment certification, the hydrogen content test report,  mechanical test data, ultrasonic inspection test report, micro/macrostructure evaluation, and any  other quality assurance data required by the specification are also to be provided.    he material certification should contain all the test results and/or verification that the material  meets all of the requirements contained in the applicable material specification. If the material  was procured from a mill or from a distributor that obtained the material in its final form from a  mill, this information will be in a mill certification. If the distributer had an intermediate product  converted into the final form, the certification should contain the original certification for the  ingot or billet, the certification from the conversion house (including starting size of billet and  the finish size), the certification from the heat-treat supplier, and the results for the ultrasonic  inspection, mechanical property testing, and the macrostructure and microstructure examinations.         Government specification to which it was certified specifically to the final products, such  as a plate, sheet, and forged bar.     key aspect of the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) documents  associated with nonconforming Ti alloys (listed in Appendix B of this NASA Technical  Handbook) has been the allegation that some suppliers have delivered final product forms,  namely bar and plate, that have been cut from intermediate product forms without the necessary  additional thermo-mechanical working, a product called a cut-down billet. Moreover, it is  alleged that material certification data associated with these final product forms were derived  from test coupons drawn from prime locations within the intermediate products that may not be  representative of the cross section from which the final products were obtained.    and SAE AMS4904, Titanium Alloy Sheet, Strip, and Plate 6Al-4V Solution Heat  Treated and Aged. A forged plate thickness is produced as a part of the forging operation,  i.e., no cutting of plate thickness occurs. These two specifications, along with most other  Ti alloy specifications, require plate to be fabricated by rolling, not forging. Forging is  not a valid method to produce Ti alloy plate. A plate fabricated by forging may not have  been worked sufficiently to meet the minimum mechanical property specifications  required by rolled plate in the aforementioned specifications.   Cut-down billet. This material is unlikely to have been sufficiently mechanically worked  to meet the minimum mechanical specifications of SAE AMS4911 and SAE AMS4904  for rolled sheet and plate or by SAE AMS6931 for forged bar. The lack of mechanical  work is related to the larger cross section. Ti alloys supplied to DoD and NASA contracts  are to conform to all contract requirements, including specifications cited in such  contracts. When rolled plate is specified, the Ti alloy is to be rolled to the required  thickness using industry standard practices. When bar is specified, the Ti alloy is to be  hot worked to the required dimensions. The required Ti alloy dimensions are not to be  accomplished by cutting down a thicker material. Almost all Ti alloy specifications  specifically prohibit this practice. Cutting plate and bar stock to create the desired length  of product to meet customer requirements is standard acceptable practice.                  vidence began accumulating that Ti alloys were being delivered from metal distributors to the  industrial supply chain without having been processed in accordance with specification and that  these materials could have strength properties below specification minimum values.  response to GIDEP releases dating from as early as 2004. The concern for inappropriate  processing of Ti alloys does not extend to primary mills but rather to the distributors.   nvestigation by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Air Force\u2019s repository of  materials and manufacturing expertise for Ti, ultimately led to a federal indictment (case number  3:08-cr-04229 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California) by the U.S.  Department of Justice against the primary and other distributor companies. The case proceeded  to trial in the fall of 2010, resulting in a plea agreement involving the imposition of a fine and  payment of restitution to the U.S. Government.  he federal indictment alleged that nonconforming, cut-down Ti alloy billet was being sold as  forged and rolled sheet, strip, bar, and plate. Other finished product forms (castings, sheet, strip,  extrusions, die forgings, rod, and wire) were not implicated.  ASA and NASA contract engineers must design components assuming minimum strength and  ductility related values that will be delivered by procured materials. If a material is not processed  in accordance with relevant specification, the engineer\u2019s design can be unknowingly  compromised. This could lead to flight project hardware designs having inadequate structural  margin, leading to structural failures and possibly mission failures.   deflections, such as in cantilever beam members, lower buckling margins for compression  structure, and changes in natural frequencies.     thermal and mechanical processing, which gives them their superior mechanical properties.  These microstructures and, hence, the alloy\u2019s mechanical properties are sensitive to the  material\u2019s processing history. Failure to properly process Ti alloy can result in lower than  specified (nonconforming) mechanical properties. The key mechanical properties are:  \uf0b7 Tensile Ultimate Strength (Ftu)  \uf0b7 Tensile Elastic Modulus (E)  \uf0b7 Tensile Yield Strength (Fty)  \uf0b7 Elongation (El)  \uf0b7 Reduction of Area (RA)        reviously mentioned JPL mechanical testing (JPL D-69922) was focused on tensile properties.  In addition to extensive static mechanical property testing, the nonconforming Ti alloy testing at  AFRL (Calcaterra, 2009) included dynamic and damage tolerance properties. Reduced dynamic  properties could result in possible service life impacts such as decreased crack initiation life,  increased fatigue crack growth rate, and decreased fracture toughness. These impacts can result  in shorter part lives and reduced inspection intervals.        improperly processed material inconsistent with plate in accordance with SAE AMS-  T-9046.   \u2013 32 specimens (37 percent) did not meet Ftu specification minimum.  \u2013 19 specimens (22 percent) did not meet Fty specification minimum.  \u2013 Crack growth rate on 37 specimens was 4 times faster than rolled plate.  ubsequent to the testing discussed in section 5.3.1 above, the USAF embarked on a large billet-  level test program for assessing the degree to which mechanical properties of such material met  minimum specification values. This test program was designed to develop property data on a  specific billet form obtained from one conversion house of two Ti alloys (Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-6Al-  6V-2Sn) representing incomplete thermal-mechanical processed material.   cm (24 in) x 48.3 cm (19 in) x 16.5 cm (6.5 in) and of 61 cm (24 in) x 114 cm (45 in) x 16.5 cm  (6.5 in). Two Ti-6Al-6V-2Sn billets were fabricated for this program to thicknesses prescribed  by AFRL to produce two different levels of hot working in the material. These billets had  nominal dimensions of 30.4 cm (12 in) x 267 cm (105 in) x 11.4 cm (4.5 in) and 30.4 cm (12 in)  x 203 cm (80 in) x 20.3 cm (8 in). Both alloys were produced in accordance with the SAE AMS-  T-9047 specification that covers reforging stock and were delivered in the mill-annealed heat-  treat condition.      \uf0b7 Fatigue Limit ( Sf)  \uf0b7 Fracture Toughness ( KIc)  \uf0b7 Fatigue Crack Growth Rate (da/dN)  \uf0b7 Corrosion and Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) resistance.         Significant numbers of test coupons were fabricated for tensile, fatigue (both stress versus  number of cycles fatigue curve (S-N) and strain versus number of cycles fatigue curve (\uf065-N)),  da/dN, KIc, and SCC testing. For example, for the Ti-6Al-4V material alone, over 300 tensile test  coupons were fabricated and tested.   Incompletely Processed Ti Alloys in Annealed Condition. The test data are compared with the  required tensile properties of plate and sheet in accordance with SAE AMS-T-9046. The decision  to refer to these baseline values as reasonable lower bounds (RLBs) was based on the fact that an  insufficient quantity of material heats and lots were represented for the calculation of traditional  MMPDS A- or B-, or even S-basis allowables (AFRL-RX-WP-TR-2012-0238). However, the  number of specimens tested (often in replicate) is significant. Thus RLB was chosen by the  USAF Ti Task Force as an acceptable term to describe properties derived from the testing of  multiple specimens from the two heats (per alloy) of material in this program. While these do not  meet the requirements for standard baseline property determination, they are, nevertheless,  significant. Under normal circumstances, three heats of material would be needed for  establishing a specification minimum (S-basis) value; whereas 10 heats of material would be  required for A- and B-basis allowables.  ductility (El and RA) RLB values were determined by the lowest value in the population. For the  durability and damage tolerance properties (Sf, da/dN, and KIc), a life factor was determined that  compared the properties of the improperly processed alloys with baseline properties generated  from control plates.   or stiffness-driven designs of space structures, there can be concerns over degraded (lower)  elastic modulus values. There were no independent tests, such as ultrasonics, conducted and/or  vibration techniques to verify degraded values indicated in this section. Organizations are  encouraged to verify off-nominal elastic modulus test values through an independent test  technique if there are structural deflection concerns.   major conclusion of the report is that engineers and designers should account for reduced  properties when assessing the integrity and safety of components made with non-conforming  materials.

Data from tested control plates were used in the  determination of RLB or life factor.  *: Fatigue and crack growth rate life factors discussed in this report that describe the relationship between Ti alloy  billet and plate should be used for initial screening purposes only. These factors represent worst-case comparisons  for only two stress ratios (R=0.05 and -1 for fatigue, R=0.1 and 0.7 for da/dN); factors approach 1.0 at certain  regions of the curves from which the factors were derived. If a program\u2019s initial screening indicates that sufficient  maintenance intervals continue to exist for Ti alloy components, no further analysis is required. However, if  maintenance intervals are found to be unacceptable during an initial screening using the published factors, a program  may conduct further analysis using the full range of the test data provided by AFRL, supplemented, as appropriate,  with test data and analysis generated by the program.         uring the course of the nonconforming Ti alloy assessment at JPL, materials and process  (M&P) engineers reviewed approximately 1,000 Ti alloy certification packages. Of these  certification packages, 120 were found to contain suspicious omissions or other irregularities.  While the investigation primarily focused on assessing if there was evidence of an improperly  processed material, specifically regarding the cutting-down billet issue, the review indicated  there were also material lots that could not be traced back to the source. Also, this investigation  revealed that heat treatment, composition, and inspection could also be issues. Out of the dozens  of lots of Ti alloy associated with these irregular certification packages, residual material from 4  lots happened to exist in sufficient quantity to facilitate the fabrication of 121 (total) tensile test  coupons. The summary of tensile test results of Ti-6Al-4V materials in annealed condition from  four certification packages indicating possible improper processing is shown in table 4, JPL  Tensile Test Results Summary of Suspected Nonconforming Ti-6Al-4V in Annealed Condition.

The test data from these six coupons were combined with the 121 test  results listed in table 4, and the total set of test data was analyzed to determine a pseudo S-basis  minimum specification value (MSV) or knockdown, which could then be used in an on-going (at  the time of the nonconforming Ti alloy investigations only) Flight Projects schedule-critical Ti  alloy parts assessment process to determine if stress analyses yielded positive design margins for  specific spacecraft components. The resulting approximate S-basis MSVs are summarized in  table 5, JPL-Established Pseudo S-Basis Nonconforming Ti Alloy Minimum Specification  Values. This assessment process should not be used as a part of standard part design/test/analysis  processes for flight applications. This information is provided to indicate what one organization  did to assess flight load margins for existing schedule-critical flight hardware where there was  the possibility of having used a nonconforming Ti alloy lot.

The person who performed the  review is an expert in statistical treatment of materials property data.

A useful  test of the integrity of the manufacturing process is to establish the chain of custody of the  material through the various stages of processing, as discussed in section 6.2 in this NASA  Technical Handbook. The absence of information in certificates about who hot worked the  product to final dimensions and what lot number is associated with the hot-working operation  seems to have increased in recent years.  respectively. These knockdown property values were used to assess whether there was still  positive stress margin for affected JPL flight parts.   he threat of nonconforming Ti alloys being used on one of many dozens of flight projects at  JPL resulted in an exhaustive component-by-component assessment in the late 2000s. Based on  the new pseudo S-basis mechanical properties established in testing (described in section 5.2.3  above) and detailed reviews of respective materials certifications, a disposition of use-as-is,  retest, or remanufacture was made on over 1,000 parts already fabricated from Ti-6Al-4V. These  were in-process parts for which the launch had not yet occurred. For a further description of this  nonstandard and temporary effort used to screen Ti alloy parts for in-process projects, refer to  Appendix C in this NASA Technical Handbook. This type of screening is not recommended as  standard practice.  ppendix D in this NASA Technical Handbook contains specific examples of four irregular  certification packages and a description of typical missing information that is either required by  the specification or expected in accordance with industry standard practice, as well as  information not in conformance with referenced specifications.    An example of a \u201cclean,\u201d i.e., acceptable, Certification Package is provided in Appendix E in this  NASA Technical Handbook.     Based on a thorough investigation of the quality of both certification documentation and the  supply chain for aerospace-grade Ti alloy material, some mitigation actions have been identified  to help avoid the chances of procuring and using nonconforming material. Some or all of these  steps and even more conservative steps can be implemented to help prevent nonconforming  material from finding its way into NASA\u2019s and its contractors\u2019 flight hardware. These measures             nonconforming material was judged to reside primarily with metal distributors. There has been  no indication of improper Ti alloy processing on the part of mills or conversion houses.  Independent testing laboratories have been known to be under pressure at times from customers  on such issues as test sample location selection and discarding of samples that have failed to  meet specification minimums. Since procurements from metal distributors have grown, the  mitigation efforts noted in this section are directed toward assuring that, when material is  procured from distributors, the buyer can be assured that it meets all requirements.    can help secure high-quality Ti alloy raw material, as well as Ti alloy components supplied  through subcontracted manufacturers and industry partners.   n important aspect of determining whether final product forms may be nonconforming involves  careful inspection of the associated certification data package. Most metal suppliers will provide  an electronic or faxed copy of the applicable, lot-specific certification package(s) before the  procurement is placed with them. This affords an opportunity to avoid rejecting any lot of  material after it shows up at the place of use.   the material through the various stages of processing to determine whether each stage was  performed by a firm having the necessary processing capability. For example, if a final product  form of plate is produced from an intermediate product form of larger thickness, additional  rolling of the intermediate form is required. If the supplier is known not to have rolling  capability, which is the case for most Ti alloy distributors, and if there is no indication that the  material was rolled by a conversion house or other facility, then one should be suspicious that the  final product may be cut-down billet.  etailed knowledge of the certification requirements associated with the various specifications,  coupled with careful review of the certification data package, including verification of claimed  chemical composition, is needed to help assure that material has been properly processed and  certified.  Mechanical Inspection, and Acquisition can all help mitigate the potential risk of procuring and  using nonconforming Ti alloys. Because of the options and conditions necessary for Ti alloys to  be compliant with a given specification, the use of appropriately trained/experienced M&P  engineers and/or QA personnel is recommended for review and acceptance of Ti alloys for flight  applications.                 upply chain surveys and audits are recommended to be performed by QA or equivalent and  M&P engineers. An example survey/audit list is shown in Appendix F in this NASA Technical  Handbook. Qualified suppliers can be placed on a Qualified Suppliers List (QSL)/Approved  Suppliers List (ASL) at JPL. An organization can then establish an internal practice that  aerospace-quality wrought Ti alloys to be used for flight application should be procured only  from QSL/ASL suppliers. Frequency of re-audits may be dependent on performance factors.  Note: The same guideline procedures described in this NASA Technical Handbook should be  used for foreign Ti alloy sources and foreign contractors.  nsure that quality clauses regarding material are sufficiently spelled out to assure that mill  certifications, processing certifications, and testing certifications are received with material or  procured metal parts.   NASA Technical Handbook, requires mill certifications, processing certifications, and  independent material testing reports for any material that has been altered subsequent to mill  processing. Mills should provide the original material test report to purchasing organizations.  Original mill material purchasing organizations who, in turn, sell portions of any given mill lot  of material are expected to provide a copy of the original mill material test report to subsequent  purchasers.    ll procurements should require the material type and specifications to be listed on the contract,  e.g., Ti-6Al-4V annealed bar in accordance with SAE AMS6931 and Ti-6Al-4V annealed plate  in accordance with SAE AMS4911.  ach drawing should require that the material type and specification are identified, e.g., Ti-6Al-  4V annealed bar in accordance with SAE AMS6931 for the Isolator of Feed Assembly drawing.   review of certifications by M&P engineers and/or trained/experienced QA or equivalent  personnel.            certification package are. Variations have occurred between outside test laboratory report results  for mechanical testing, as provided with supplied material certification packages, and internal  post-material delivery testing.     assessment, a detailed evaluation of mechanical test report values was conducted between values  reported in the certificate package and values from internal tests at JPL. The 24 test coupons  created 96 data points of mechanical test data for tensile ultimate, tensile yield, percent  elongation, and percent reduction of area. Out of the total 96 data points, 93 in-house test values  were less than any of the independent test laboratory reported values. The independent test lab  provided two test values for each mechanical property, i.e. eight total test values. For a detailed  comparison of the two sets of mechanical property values, see Appendix H in this NASA  Technical Handbook.   perform additional independent spot-check material testing to compare selected supplier\u2019s  material test reports. The independent testing laboratory should be certified for specific testing,  such as mechanical testing, chemical analysis, nondestructive evaluation (NDE), etc., by the  National Aerospace and Defense Contractors Accreditation Program (Nadcap) or ISO in  accordance with AS9100, Aerospace Standard: Quality Management Systems - Requirements for  Aviation, Space and Defense Organizations. The Nadcap or ISO certification does not guarantee  accurate results; therefore, it is recommended that, along with looking for this certification, the  Center perform an audit of the testing house to ensure compliance with the test standards or  specifications and follow up with test laboratories that have demonstrated test result deviations  of concern.  nother potential issue is material test reports that contain typical or average test values rather  than actual test values. When the material specification requires quantitative limits for chemical,  mechanical, or physical properties, the test report should contain the actual test and/or inspection  values obtained. Certificates for physical properties should show actual values.  nonconforming material. The enhancements are in the vein of industry best practices and offer  the greatest amount of protection for the least cost.          n addition to the acquisition organization\u2019s role in utilizing the revised approach for the  procurement of raw metal, it is recommended to use the same requirements when acquiring  machined/fabricated items when the supplier is responsible for acquiring the raw material to be  used. This requires an approach similar to that used for raw material, i.e., the ASL process, to  assure conforming materials are acquired and used for these part or multiple part/assembly-level  procurements. The same material requirements and specifications, mill/processing certifications,  and test reporting and review are as needed for raw metal. This can be accomplished by  incorporation of the already described quality clause entitled Raw Material Traceability.   different approach may be needed, since these efforts may not be controlled through the  procuring organization\u2019s QA and/or M&P Engineering organizations. One approach can be to  establish standard Subcontract Data Requirements Lists (SDRLs)/Data Requirement  Descriptions (DRDs), that an organization\u2019s contracting personnel can use. This would provide  the QA/M&P Engineering organizations standards to be used for these subcontracts and may be  tailored, with appropriate document-owner approval. Included in this set of DRDs is the  Hardware End Item Data Package DRD in which the applicable material certification  requirements are contained. In addition to using the recommended language contained in the  standard SDRLs/DRDs, it is important that the institutional Mission Assurance organization  support and verify that the appropriate requirements are included in these subcontracts.  Examples of recommended language for such SDRLs/DRDs are:     \uf0b7 When a contractor supplies converted material produced by a raw material manufacturer,  the contractor shall submit all pre- and post-conversion chemical/physical tests reports  and any contractor arranged retests.

Titanium and titanium alloys supplied to DoD and NASA contracts must conform to all  contract requirements, including specifications cited in such contracts. When rolled plate  is specified, the titanium material must be rolled to the required thickness using industry  standard practices. When bar is specified, the titanium material must be hot worked to the  required dimensions. The required titanium material dimensions must not be  accomplished by cutting down a thicker material. Forged material must not be substituted  for rolled material requirements. Rolled material must not be substituted for forged  material requirements.   unacceptable product substitution under a government contract when the controlling  specification does not allow it.  . The superseding indictment referenced in the October 5, 2009, issuance of AAN-U-10-  005 was filed in the U.S. District Court, southern district of California, in criminal case  no. 08-cr4229-JLS. A second superseding indictment dated February 23, 2010, was also  filed in this case.         SCREENING OF TI ALLOY PARTS  FOR IN-PROCESS PROJECTS AT JPL    used, material distributor, heat number, mill source, mill product size, mill certification, lot  number, name of conversion house, certification of conversion processing, billet or starting  material size, final product size, final product condition, mechanical test report, nondestructive  testing certification, heat-treatment certification, and more.     Additionally, a method was developed to assess the risk of components with suspect or  incomplete certification paper. Ultimately, each Ti alloy component was reviewed by an M&P  Engineering specialist and assigned a category number, as described below:        he Ti part identification triggered a review of material certifications if a suspect source was  observed in the certification trail. Then, an emphasis was placed on obtaining a full certification  package for review by M&P Engineering.                             Suspect source material conditions that triggered a \u201csuspect certification/suspect material rating\u201d  were:    \u2212 Test methods used to generate data.  \u2212 What standards were used.  \u2212 Test laboratories/certifications.  \u2212 Mill certification/source.  \u2212 Heat treatment/thermal processing information.  \u2212 Properties indicate on certificate that they do not meet specification requirements.  however, the certificate should contain information to determine if material was bar or  billet.   \u2212 Mill-only certified ingot chemistry was provided with final product.  \u2212 Lacks conclusive evidence of adequate hot working.     specification requirements were satisfied; however, supplied material was cut from  billet that exceeded allowable cross-sectional area of 309.68 cm2 (48 in2).                                  Justification: Producing Ti alloy plate, sheet, or strip material in thicknesses less than  or equal to 4.8 mm (0.188 in) for multi-square feet of product via machining billet  stock material is considered more challenging (potato chip effect) and costly and,  therefore, highly unlikely to be used by suppliers, than typically used sheet  production techniques, i.e., rolling operations, used in industry.    \u2212 Producing Ti alloy wire form in diameters less than or equal to 7.9 mm (0.312 in)  in any reasonable lengths (multi-meters) via machining of Ti alloy billet stock  material is considered more challenging and costly, hence, highly unlikely to have  been used by suppliers, than typically used wire drawing operations used in  industry.   material to be thermo-mechanically processed, i.e., drawn through smaller and  smaller dies, interspersed with annealing operations, to create required wire gage  (diameter) product form.   procurement specifications, e.g., NAS 4004, Fastener, 6AL-4V Titanium Alloy,  Externally Threaded, 160 ksi Ftu, 95 ksi Fsu, 450 \u00b0F, for inch fasteners and NAS  NA0007, Procurement Specification Metric Fasteners, Titanium Alloy, Externally  Threaded, 1100 MPa Tensile, 660 MPa Shear, for metric fasteners, via machining  Ti alloy billet material are considered too high to be credible.
