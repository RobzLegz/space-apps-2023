This handbook provides methodology and approaches for  implementation of fracture control on payloads or experiments flown on these vehicles and is  written to satisfy the intent of the applicable NASA fracture control requirements for payloads  and experiments delineated in References 1-9 in Section 4.   experience related to fracture control assessment of hardware that has flown aboard the NASA  Space Shuttle. Experience has shown that, in general, relatively few parts or components in  payloads and experiments are truly \"fracture critical\". Some units or assemblies may have no  fracture critical parts. The guidance reflected in this handbook aids in classification of parts and  helps reduce the number of parts that, because of lack of definition, could be classified fracture  critical unnecessarily. Fracture critical designation requires special considerations and  treatment for the respective part. This is absolutely necessary on parts, whose failure is  catastrophic, but can become resource consuming and potentially schedule significant if parts  are classified fracture critical in a casual manner.  A viable fracture control program relies on design, analysis, non-destructive evaluation,  and tracking of fracture critical hardware. It is expected that flight hardware will be consistent  with aerospace standards, practices, and quality. It is beyond the scope, or intent, of this  document to address technical or quality disciplines that should already exist and be in place  irrespective of fracture control. Fracture control is imposed and required to enhance safety of  manned space flight systems. Fracture control programs can significantly supplement properly  designed, high quality hardware with additional assurance against catastrophic structural  failures caused by unexpected and/or undetectable flaws. Fracture control is not intended to  compensate for poor design, analytical errors, misuse, or poor quality. Although fracture control  can be effective in adding assurance of mission success, it is not specifically required for that  purpose in References 1-9.   leads to structural failure, reasonableness and credibility must prevail. Many bad things can be  imagined as a result of chained, unlikely events. Consequently, those who do fracture control  and those who judge it must put some restraint on their imaginations and temper them with the  likelihood that the events under consideration have a reasonable chance of occurring.   a. All individual structural parts contain flaws or crack-like defects. Minimum life of the  part may be determined by considering one and only one flaw in the most critical area of the  part and in the most unfavorable orientation.  b. The use of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques does not negate the above  assumption. NDE techniques establish a probable upper bound on the size of the assumed  FRACTURE CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION FOR PAYLOADS,  EXPERIMENTS, AND SIMILAR HARDWARE         initial flaw at a specified confidence level. If no flaws are detected during inspection, a flaw size  at least as large as the probable upper bound flaw size established by the appropriate NDE  technique should be used for analysis.    n the event previously flown hardware exists that was previously flown without full fracture  control, it should be assessed prior to subsequent reflight using an appropriate fracture control  approach.  t is recommended that the fracture control analyst become familiar with all portions of this  handbook. Information is included in the handbook body and in the appendices. Section 3  addresses responsibilities in fracture control. References for fracture control requirements and  information the analyst will find useful are presented in Section 4. Section 5 addresses non-  fracture critical and fracture critical hardware for generic and specific hardware items. The  methodology for assessing fracture critical parts is discussed in Section 6 and tracking for these  parts is discussed in Section 7. Section 8 provides documentation descriptions while Section 9  provides alternative methods for fracture control and Section 10 briefly discusses requirements  other than fracture control. An acronym list and definitions are given in Appendix A.  Appendices L through P give examples of fracture control documentation. Other appendices  provide pertinent information as referenced in the body of the handbook. An Index is included,  in addition to the Table of Contents, to assist the reader in finding specific information.   prescribed service period due to propagation of undetected pre-existing crack-like defects  (flaws). (NOTE: If cracks are detected, the part will normally be repaired or scrapped. Flight of  parts with known crack-like flaws is not permitted without specific analysis and approvals as  described in Section 6.4). The intent of this handbook is to provide fracture control  implementation guidance applicable to a variety of hardware designs and purposes. A variety of  fracture control considerations and options are addressed, many of which may not be applicable  to a given design. The user is encouraged to keep assessment of parts simple, and focused,  and to use this handbook, as appropriate, to aid in implementation of fracture control.  Information is provided to assist the user in the development of an effective Fracture Control  Plan, as well as other fracture control documentation, and in development and completion of an  acceptable and efficient fracture control program through identification of cost effective criteria,  procedures, and controls.    the general lines of responsibility and the parties involved in fracture control activities.  Responsibilities may involve both the line and the project organizations. Definitions for the  various organizations involved are given in Appendix A.

(FCC) and the System Safety and Mission Assurance (SSMA) Representative should assure  that the fracture control activity is properly implemented and should expedite the generation of  the required documentation per Section 8 of this handbook. This should be done with the  oversight, advice, and approval of the Responsible Fracture Control Authority (RFCA). Fracture  control program responsibilities should be identified prior to the Phase I Safety Review for  payloads/ experiments that will be reviewed by the Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP), or  identified by the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) for flight hardware that will be reviewed by a  safety authority not requiring phased reviews. For effective fracture control implementation, the  group, organization, or person(s) should be identified who have the following responsibilities:  a. Fracture classification of parts/components.  b. Identification and specification of required NDE inspections or any other special     d. Fracture mechanics, fatigue, and structural analyses.  e. Assessment of anomalies on fracture critical parts/components and for decisions    esigners and analysts should become familiar with fracture control requirements and conduct  a hardware assessment as delineated in Appendix E of this document to establish the fracture  criticality of structural parts and components. After a final list of fracture critical parts is  determined, the required analyses, inspections and other fracture control activity must be  implemented and monitored to assure timely and proper completion.  ost of this handbook is written for the analyst responsible for assembling the fracture control  plan, analysis, and much of the final documentation. The designers who design the hardware  and produce the drawings from which hardware is made also have an important responsibility in  fracture control. In addition to good design practices the following are encouraged:          NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005                                     NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     control requirements that programs must meet.

Section 5.1 gives a detail explanation of each of these  classifications and suggestions for classifying specific hardware items.  racture critical hardware includes pressure vessels, high energy or high momentum rotating  equipment, hazardous fluid containers, habitable modules, and any remaining hardware that  does not fit the first two categories of exempt or non-fracture critical. All fracture critical hardware  must be shown to meet fracture control requirements through analysis or test (Section 6.).  Section 5.2 provides criteria for classifying and assessing specific types of fracture critical  hardware.  objective is to determine the fracture critical parts and the secondary objective is to show that all  parts have been examined for their fracture criticality. To do this, all non-exempt parts should be  accounted for on a fracture control summary list that would be included in the fracture control  analysis report. Examples of such a summary list are given in Appendix E.   ssessment of hardware criticality must examine the different phases of application including  launch, on-orbit, and return-to-ground (including a contingency abort without ground services) to  determine the applicability and extent of fracture control. For example, a part may not be  fracture critical during the launch phase, but could be fracture critical for on-orbit service. In this  case fracture control assessments will address the on-orbit phase as well as other phases and  their potential effects on the on-orbit performance.  racture critical parts must be identified as such on the drawings. This alerts all who use the  drawing as to the criticality of the part. Designers and analysts must work together to assure  that required notations, including NDE and/or proof test requirements, etc., are provided on the  drawing for any fracture critical part.   of each of the non-fracture critical classifications and suggestions for classifying specific  hardware items as such. Those parts/components, which are identified as non-fracture critical  according to Appendix E, and are assessed by the applicable methods in this Section, should  comply with the intent of fracture control requirements without imposing further activity beyond  conventional aerospace verification and quality assurance procedures.  5.1.1 Low Released Mass. Released masses in the shuttle cargo bay can be  catastrophic hazards. Catastrophic release is based on potential penetration of the rear  bulkhead of the cargo bay during launch and penetration of the cargo bay \"floor\" during landing.  For on-orbit applications and hardware inside modules or special containers during launch, a  specific assessment based on potential damage to safety critical parts or assemblies must be  made. Potential release need only be examined for a single failure. Combinations of individual  failures leading to a potentially catastrophic release of mass need not be considered unless the  initial failure would overload remaining structural attachment beyond ultimate load capability.       whose failure would release a free mass in the Shuttle cargo bay weighing less than 0.25 pound  (113 gm), or less than 14/h pound (h = travel distance of the part in feet to the cargo bay aft  bulkhead) and whose single failure (including loss of function) would also not be a catastrophic  hazard in itself, can be classified non-fracture critical. Potential released masses in the cargo  bay using the 14/h ratio should be limited to two pounds.  otential release of a small mass in the crew cabin or a habitable module, due to a single point  failure, must also be examined for hazard potential. All parts in this category, of any size, whose  release would not be a catastrophic hazard during any phase of Shuttle launch or flight, can be  classified non-fracture critical. Parts in this category whose release would be a catastrophic  hazard are fracture critical and must be dispositioned per Section 5.2 and Appendix E.  asteners pre-loaded in tension, which have low fracture toughness, KIc/Fty < 0.33 in1/2 (1.66  mm1/2), must be limited to 0.03 pound (14 gm) potential free mass. If a fastener is steel and the  KIc value is not known, low fracture toughness must be assumed when the A basis ultimate  strength is greater than 180 ksi (1241 N/m2). Parts/components with a single point failure that  would exceed low released mass limits should, preferably, be contained (Section 5.1.12.), or  meet low risk criteria (Section 5.1.2) and therefore be classified non-fracture critical. Otherwise,  applicable requirements of Section 5.2 (fracture critical part) must be applied.  The following defines parts whose potential mass releases would have a very low or nil  probability of resulting in a catastrophic hazard and which are, therefore, non-fracture critical.   examined for consequences of single failure mass release on orbit. If any single failure mass  release would be a catastrophic hazard, appropriate fracture control must be applied to the  hardware. If a single failure could release a mass (independent of size), and it would not result in  a catastrophic occurrence or loss of a safety critical function, the part can be classified non-  fracture critical. Where uncertainty exists as to consequences of a release, the release velocity  must be no more than 35 ft/sec and the release momentum must be no more than 8.75 ft-lb/sec.   that would be contained by associated hardware and present no threat to safety. Single failure  mass releases that do not meet low released mass requirements, or which have not been  assessed for mass release hazard, can be assessed for safe containment of potential single  failure released mass by a surrounding enclosure. A part confined in a container or housing, or  otherwise positively restrained from free release; and when failure, in itself, would not result in a  catastrophic hazard, the part can be classified non-fracture critical. Included in this category are  stowed parts/components having a total weight of 70 pounds (31.8 kg) or less and which are  stowed according to NSTS requirements (NSTS 21000-IDD-MDK) in a mid-deck locker or  equivalent confinement during launch and landing. Parts/components weighing up to 200  pounds (91 kg) confined in standard get-away-special (GAS) canisters can also be accepted as  contained against mass releases into the cargo bay. Hardware that is designed for transport  to/from orbit in soft stowage bags such as the Cargo Transfer Bags described in SSP 50467  may be considered contained during launch and landing.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005         NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Pressurized components or rotating devices within stowed or contained hardware must be  assessed independently, as provided for in these guidelines, to assure against explosion and/or  release of fragments or hazardous fluids outside of the container, or over-pressurization and  catastrophic failure of the container/compartment. Containment of rotating devices must  consider the combined effect of rotational speed and potential for mass release to determine  classification (see 5.1.5.). A method for calculating containment of high energy rotating devices  is given in Appendix B.  ontained hardware must also be examined for potential damage effects of single point mass  releases inside of the confinement itself. Potential impact by released masses of 0.25 pound or  less need not be regarded as a catastrophic hazard to pressurized hardware or penetration of  the container. Potential single failure release of larger masses inside of apparent containment  must be assessed for hazard potential. Release of masses (of any size) within a container or  payload, that could credibly defeat an internal safety critical function, should be precluded by  appropriate technical measures, which may include compliance with requirements for low risk  part classification (See 5.1.12) or other techniques approved by the RFCA.   internal parts. Enclosures with openings can only be assessed for containment of parts larger  than accessible openings. Typical electronic boxes and related equipment, radios, cameras,  recorders, PCs, and similar close-packed and enclosed hardware can be regarded as  acceptable containers of internal parts without further assessment. Documented engineering  judgment may be used in other cases where it is self-evident that containment exists. In  instances of uncertainty an analysis or test should be conducted. The analysis or test should be  designed to assess the \"worst case\" condition (heaviest piece/greatest travel distance/thinnest  wall that could be penetrated, etc.) for the hardware in question. Successful containment for the  worst case will demonstrate containment for all other associated parts. Appendix B provides a  methodology for doing general containment analysis.  elease of a free mass from a fastener that is mechanically constrained (e.g., safety wired) can  be assumed to be non-credible. All constrained fasteners can be classified non-fracture critical  if failure does not result in a catastrophic hazard due to loss of structural integrity of the  fastener, or loss of a safety critical function.   open, the closure design must be one failure tolerant of accidentally opening, i.e., hinges,  latches, etc., must be redundant for keeping a door closed in the event one device fails.  Otherwise, containment cannot be assumed.   catastrophic hazard because there is redundant structure sufficient to redistribute the load path  or there is no catastrophic hazard associated with the failure. For purposes of fracture control,  structure (including fasteners, latches, and mechanisms) may be identified as \u201cfail safe\u201d and  classified non-fracture critical when it can be shown that, due to structural redundancy, structure  remaining (assumed unflawed) after any single structural failure can withstand the redistributed  loads with a minimum ultimate safety factor of 1.0 on limit load. Joint gapping is allowed under  fail safe or emergency conditions. When doing fail safe analysis, it is usually sufficient to  remove the member with the highest load and the member with the lowest margin (these may  not be the same) to assess fail safe capability. In highly redundant complex structures, the  analyst should document rationale for member selection and present it to the RFCA for  approval. There are structural fault tolerance requirements (Reference 26) for mechanisms         unrelated to fracture control that must also be met. Failures that are classified fail safe must not  result in release of unacceptable free masses (see Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2).       n some cases, fail safe categorization can be a matter of engineering judgment based on high  structural margins, design experience, materials characteristics, overall configuration, etc. If  failure of a part/component is clearly not a catastrophic hazard, the part/component can be  classified during the initial screening as non-fracture critical without further fracture control  assessment. This approach should be coordinated with the RFCA and documented.  redundant structure that is reflown and for on-orbit structure subject to significant fatigue loading  at program prescribed intervals. Reverification may be accomplished by a close visual  inspection (aided by cameras, borescopes, or other assistance if necessary) of the hardware for  signs of damage. If damage is indicated, a more rigorous inspection must be made to establish  fail safe structural integrity. In this case partial disassembly for better visibility may be required,  and NDE inspection or other appropriate evaluation used.    sufficient fatigue capability to reach end of service. The fatigue assessment of the assumed  remaining structure should use concentrated stresses and a factor of 4.0 on total cycles.  5.1.4 Non-Hazardous Leak Before Burst (NHLBB) Pressurized Components. This  Section addresses pressurized hardware that is characterized by benign/safe failure modes.  Appendix G provides a flow diagram to identify various types of pressurized hardware.  Pressurized components/systems whose only credible failure mode at the Maximum Design  Pressure (MDP), due to the presence of a flaw, is development of a non-hazardous leak (as  opposed to catastrophic fragmentation or abrupt rupture), are inherently characterized as a  benign/safe failure. This hardware may be classified as NHLBB, provided that slow release of  the fluid contents is not a catastrophic hazard. Catastrophic hazards to be considered in this  assessment include unacceptable dilution or toxicity of breathing environment, increases in  oxygen or flammable fluids beyond flammability limits, loss of a safety critical function, etc.    ven if NHLBB cannot be achieved, leak before burst (LBB) is the preferred design practice,  because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than  one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for components that will have safe  life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.  bellows, etc. are accepted as NHLBB designs and they can be classified as non-fracture critical  provided all of the following are met:   NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   include loss of a safety critical function, dangerous environmental changes such as  unacceptable oxygen content, creation of explosive mixtures, dangerous toxicity, etc.     d. They are made of typical materials per applicable piping codes or space flight  hardware requirements. Typical materials in this category include stainless steels, aluminum,  and Inconel.  e. The critical flaw size at the MDP is a through flaw at least 10 times the thickness in  length. The analyst should make sure that any actual through cracks in the hardware will be  less than 10t in length when this check is made. Otherwise, an actual crack in the hardware  may have grown past 10t potentially leading to an unsafe situation.  f. Leak is automatically detected and further pressure cycling is prevented or there is no  repressurization. If the item can experience continued crack growth after leak, it must be safe  life against burst for crack growth beyond 10t (item d).    necessary condition for NHLBB is that the critical flaw size at the MDP is a through flaw at  least 10 times the thickness in length. A method is given in Appendix C for verifying that this  critical flaw size requirement for cylindrical pressure system components is met. To be  classified NHLBB, hardware must meet the criteria given on the appropriate check sheet in  Appendix H.   5.1.5 Non-Fracture Critical Rotating Machinery. This Section addresses rotating  machinery that does not possess sufficient energy or momentum to present a catastrophic  hazard risk and should not be classified as fracture critical (see Section 5.2.2.). Low energy and  low momentum rotating equipment should be examined for protection against a catastrophic  occurrence resulting from released masses in the event of failure. Rotating equipment, whose  failure could be catastrophic, must be shown to be contained, or assurance that failure will not  occur because of an existing flaw must be demonstrated. The mounts for rotating machinery  must be addressed as standard structure and assessed for fracture criticality.  n general, rotation of less than 500 rpm (low speed) of small devices is accepted as non-  fracture critical based on their associated low energy and low momentum. Shrouded or  enclosed fans (8000 rpm and 8 inch diameter maximum), electric motors, shafts, gearboxes,  recorders, conventional pumps (including roughing pumps), and similar devices are accepted as  inherently meeting containment requirements, or the full intent of requirements, and can be  classified non-fracture critical without further assessment during initial screening. The effect of  rotating equipment failure on the functionality of associated hardware is not a factor in  classification for fracture control unless a catastrophic hazard is a direct result. In that case the  rotating device must be classified fracture critical.       Analyses (see Appendix B) or tests must be carried out where there is uncertainty regarding  containment of fragmented pieces. Where containment cannot be assured, or failure results in  a catastrophic hazard, the device must be treated in accordance with applicable criteria in  Section 5.2.2 for fracture critical rotating machinery.  aving a kinetic energy of less than 14,240 foot pounds does not imply that the device is non-  fracture critical. See Appendix K for an example of high momentum rotating hardware that is  fracture critical but has less kinetic energy than 14,240 foot pounds.   clearly not be a catastrophic hazard, or a group of fasteners or pins where loss of any one  fastener or pin would clearly not result in a catastrophic hazard, can be classified as non-  fracture critical (by inspection) during initial screening. These fasteners must clearly and  obviously meet the requirements of Sections 5.1.1, or 5.1.2, or 5.1.3, and be classified  accordingly. In cases where the classification is not obvious, analysis or test is required to  support the disposition. See Appendix E for additional guidelines for classifying parts.  verification and quality assurance requirements only. Fracture control for safe life rivets is  impractical and not realistically implemented.    not lend themselves to conventional fracture control methodology and high quality must be  relied on for assured performance. Such devices are non-fracture critical by exemption.   amenable to conventional fracture control methodology. However, as with other structures, if  structural failure of a composite/bonded part can be shown to be fail safe (Section 5.1.3), and  potential single failure mass release meets low released mass requirements (Section 5.1.1), or  is contained (Section 5.1.2), the part can be classified non-fracture critical. Additionally, parts  can be classified non-fracture critical when it can be shown that the strain level at limit load is  less than the damage tolerant threshold strain level. The strain level approach, or alternate  approaches, must be coordinated with the RFCA prior to implementation. Note that composite  structures require proof testing for structural strength reasons (see Applicable Document 7 and  Reference Documents 23, and 24).  5.1.8 Glass. Broken glass pieces larger than 50 microns are unacceptable in habitable  volumes, and therefore must be contained to be non-fracture critical. In uninhabited volumes,  glass must be low released mass or contained to be non-fracture critical. When determining  released mass, it can be assumed that glass parts, such as mirrors or lenses will break into  releasable pieces no larger than 1/3 of original size. Camera lenses and similar pieces that are  recessed or protected during non-use periods are considered protected glass and may be  classified non-fracture critical.

Sealed containers that are  NHLBB (i.e., critical length of through crack is at least 10 times the wall thickness, any existing  through flaws are less than 10t, and fluid release would not create a catastrophic hazard) may  be classified as low risk and therefore non-fracture critical if the container supports meet  fracture control requirements and the container complies with both of the following:     If pressurized to 1.5 atmospheres or less, the containers are acceptable. If  pressurized to more than 1.5 atmospheres, an analysis must show that the safety  factor is 2.5 or greater or the container must be proof-tested to a minimum of 1.5  times the MDP.   The container supports may or may not require NDE depending on their individual fracture  control classification.  n special cases, containers with pressure or contained energy exceeding the limits given in the  definitions may be acceptable, but these containers must be specifically approved by the RFCA  and by the PSRP. At a minimum, an analysis must show the ultimate safety factor is 2.5 or  greater, and that the container is an NHLBB design. In addition, the container must be proof-  tested to a minimum of 1.5 times the MDP.  Appendix C for verifying that the critical flaw size requirement for NHLBB of cylindrical sealed  containers is met.    specified in Section 5.2.6 can be classified non-fracture critical if they also meet the  requirements of Sections 5.1.1 or 5.1.2.   containers. It is expected that batteries and battery systems will be built to existing  requirements and guidelines for flight applications (JSC 20793) thereby providing basic  assurance for battery safety. If batteries and/or their applications still generate a safety concern  because of credible, potentially destructive pressure build-up or possible release of a product  that would be a catastrophic hazard, they should be assessed using fracture control  methodology. Battery cells and cases (battery boxes) should be assessed as unique  pressurized hardware or containers. Battery cells must be examined for structural failure mode  at design operating conditions and for hazard category if contents are released. Sealed battery  cases (containers of battery cells), if used, must be given similar evaluation.   includes Ni-H batteries because of the relative small amounts of released hydrogen that would  be involved. Battery cells that are not NHLBB or whose open release of contents would be a  catastrophic hazard can be classified non-fracture critical if the respective failures would be  suitably contained by a battery case, or by levels of containment as specified in NSTS 1700.7B,  section 209.1b, including absorbent layers. Small batteries in common use, such as button cells               NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  of 200 milliamp-hours or less and carbon-zinc or zinc-air batteries of size \u201cF\u201d or smaller are  exempt from fracture control.  5.1.12 Low Risk Part. This Section addresses parts that can be classified non-fracture  critical because of large structural margins and other considerations that make failure from a  pre-existing flaw extremely unlikely. Classification of parts in this category should be  coordinated with the RFCA for approval. For a general part to be classified low risk it must meet  5.1.12.1 and 5.1.12.2 below; Limitations on Applicability, and Inherent Assurance Against  Failure From a Crack-Like Flaw. Fasteners and shear pins need only meet item 5.1.12.3.  Check sheets are included in Appendix H to assist the analyst in determining low risk for  general parts and fasteners.    5.1.12.1 Limitations on Applicability. The part must be all metal and for aluminum parts  the primary load path should not be in the short transverse direction if this dimension is greater  than three inches. It must not be the pressure shell of a human-tended module or personnel  compartment, pressure vessel, or pressurized component in a pressurized system containing a  hazardous fluid. Rotating machinery must operate below the energy limit set for the automatic  classification as fracture critical (Section 5.2.2). A part whose failure will directly result in a  catastrophic hazard is also excluded, except when the total (unconcentrated) tensile stresses in  the part at limit load are no greater than 30 percent of the ultimate tensile strength for the metal  used and all other requirements for low risk classification are met.   part must possess inherent assurance against catastrophic failure from a crack-like flaw by  compliance with a. and b. below:     stress corrosion cracking as defined in MSFC-STD-3029, or MSFC-HDBK-527/JSC 09604. If  other than Table I or A-rated materials as classified respectively in these documents must be  used, suitability for the specific application must be documented by a Materials Usage  Agreement (MUA) approved by the proper authority. MUA forms contained in the cited  documents, or equivalent, must be used.  (2) The part must not be fabricated using a process that has a significant probability of  introducing cracks (including welding, custom forging, casting, or quenching heat treatments on  materials sensitive to quench cracking) unless specific NDE or testing, which has been  approved by the RFCA, is applied to sufficiently screen for cracks. It can be assumed that  significant crack-like defects do not occur for standard forgings or during machining of standard  forgings, sheet, bar, extrusions, or plate products that are produced in accordance with  aerospace quality specifications and are known to have good machinability properties. All parts  must have a material property ratio of KIc/Fty > 0.33 in1/2 (1.66 mm1/2). With the approval of the  RFCA, the effect of material thickness on K value may be considered, and the KIe value may be  used in lieu of KIc if it is known for a specific application.           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  (3) Parts classified as low risk fracture parts may be accepted using normally applied  methods that ensure aerospace quality flight hardware. At a minimum, these parts must receive  a visual inspection for surface defects. Defects that could affect part life are cause for rejection.  Inspections should be made on individual parts prior to assembly to maximize accessibility for  inspection.          High margin can be shown by a maximum tensile stress that will not  exceed the endurance limit or Smax < Ftu/(4{1-0.5 R}), where Smax  is the local concentrated stress, and R is the ratio of minimum stress  to maximum stress in a fatigue cycle.   accounts for the effects of notches and mean stress and which  shows a minimum of four complete service lives with a safety factor  of 1.5 on alternating stress.    an analysis predicts that credible initial flaws caused by handling, machining, assembly or  testing will not propagate to failure in four complete service lives. The analysis must assume  surface cracks of 0.025 inch (0.63 mm.) depth by 0.05 inch (1.25 mm.) length and corner cracks  of 0.025 inch (0.63 mm.) radius.    a. Fastener is in a local pattern of two or more similar fasteners.  b. Fastener and joint are of conventional design and within Shuttle or ISS experience base.  c. Be high-quality military standard, national aircraft standard, or equivalent commercial  fasteners or pins that are fabricated and inspected in accordance with aerospace-type  specifications.  d. Fasteners used in multi-cycle tension loaded application must have rolled threads.  e. Be fabricated from well-characterized metal not sensitive to stress corrosion cracking.  If used in tension application is not made from a low toughness alloy as defined in  f.   Section 5.1.1 or specifically, Ti-6Al-4V STA titanium.  g. Fastener meets appropriate preload, and stress requirements with no joint gapping  (gapping is allowed under fail safe and/or emergency conditions). Bolted joint analysis  criteria may be found in NSTS 08307 and factors of safety in NASA-STD-5001.  h. Have positive back-off prevention consistent with their criticality. Back-off prevention                                                    5.2 Fracture Critical Parts/Components. This Section provides criteria for classifying  and assessing specific types of fracture critical hardware. In addition to the requirements in this  section, fracture critical parts must meet the general safe life requirements in Section 6. unless  specifically stated otherwise.  5.2.1 Pressure Vessels and Pressurized Components. All pressure vessels, and all  pressurized hardware that contains hazardous fluids, must be classified fracture critical. See the  flow diagram in Appendix G for assistance in understanding the various categories of  pressurized hardware.  t is preferred design practice to make pressurized hardware LBB, because hardware that can  tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than one that cannot. If the hardware  is LBB and leak is hazardous (catastrophic), the hardware must be safe life against leak;  otherwise, it must be safe life against burst.         must be shown to be safe life by fracture mechanics analysis combined with appropriate  inspections or tests. They must also comply with the requirements of Applicable Documents 2  and 3 and Sections 4 and 5 of Reference 15. Sections 4 and 5 of Reference 15 may be  replaced by Reference 13. The analyst should make the following modifications in applying the  referenced requirements:  The low risk approach provides the analyst with a method for assessing fastener patterns  without doing a fail safe analysis. The check sheet in Appendix H provides a method of  documenting the required low risk criteria.      inspected after acceptance proof testing (See Appendix I and Section 6.3.1) in addition to  inspections that may have been performed prior to acceptance tests.       For low cycle applications (< 50 pressure cycles), a proof test of each flight vessel to  a minimum of 1.5 times MDP and a fatigue analysis showing the greater of 500 pressure cycles  or 10 lifetimes may be used in lieu of testing a qualification vessel. This option may be used  when the pressure vessel can be verified as otherwise compliant with the requirements of NSTS  1700.7 and MIL-STD-1522A, Approach A.

If fracture mechanics data are not available, or if reliable  conservative estimates of properties cannot be made, a vessel test may be conducted to verify  the NHLBB capability with the approval of the RFCA.  5.2.1.2 Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs). COPVs must meet the  intent of Reference 14. A damage prevention plan must be developed for the overwrapped  pressure vessel(s) and be made a part of the hardware data package. A stress rupture life  assessment is required for each COPV. The analyst should make the following modifications in  applying Reference 14:    5.2.1.3 Lines Fittings and Other Pressurized Components. Lines, fittings, and other  pressurized components (equipment that is part of a pressurized system including valves, filters,  regulators, heat pipes, heat exchangers, etc.) are to be considered fracture critical if they  contain hazardous fluids or if loss of pressurization would result in a catastrophic hazard. All  fusion joints in fracture critical systems must be 100 percent inspected using a qualified NDE  method(s) that will determine the presence of unacceptable lack of penetration or other  unacceptable conditions both on the surface and within the weldment. Unless impractical,  inspection of fracture critical fusion joints must be made after proof testing, and for lines and  fittings after proof test of the final assembly. In instances where NDE is not feasible, or is  incapable of being dealt with successfully, a process control program that demonstrably assures  the quality of the uninspectable welds may be employed. An example of the requirements for  such a program along with its supporting rationale is given in Section 5.2.1.4 below.  Concurrence of the RFCA is required where full NDE is not considered practical. Any type of  flaw indication in the final product that does not meet specification requirements will be cause  for rejection. In addition to proof testing of parts during individual acceptance, the complete  pressure system must also be proof-tested and leak-checked to demonstrate system integrity.  Safe life analysis is not required for fracture-critical lines, fittings, and other pressurized  components, which are proof-tested to a minimum of 1.5 times the MDP and meet the safety  factor requirements of NSTS 1700.7.   by Process Control. As stated above, there may be cases where NDE of the welds in fracture  critical pressurized components is not practical. In this case, process control with sufficient  rationale may be used to accept the welds. This rationale should be submitted to the RFCA for  approval. An example of acceptable rationale with points for consideration is given below.

The effect of any environmental exposure should be accounted for during the  qualification testing, including long duration exposure effects. In addition, the pressures used for  qualification testing must account for all possible conditions occurring during the lifetime of the  component. Finally, the program may wish to consider extending qualification cycle testing  beyond the required factor of four (4) to demonstrate design margin past minimum requirements.  n addition to other requirements for fracture-critical components, rotating machinery that has a  kinetic energy of 14,240 foot-pounds or greater must be proof tested (spin-tested) and must be  subjected to NDE before and after proof testing. If NDE after proof testing is not practical, then  the rotating part must be contained, and loss of function must not be safety critical, or it must be  shown that the proof test adequately screens for flaws (see Section 6.3.2). Proof test to screen  for flaws requires RFCA approval. The proof test level must be greater than or equal to the  level derived by fracture mechanics analysis or the level required by normal acceptance test.   components if structural failure of them due to crack propagation can cause a catastrophic  hazard. Appendix K shows an example of a rotating device that has less kinetic energy than  stated above, but has significant rotational momentum and fracture critical parts. The parts are  classified fracture critical because they have credible structural failure modes due to crack  propagation that may cause sudden jamming and stoppage of the rotor generating loads that  could result in a catastrophic hazard.     fail safe, or low risk. Potential catastrophe because of a single fastener failure should be  avoided. Fasteners that do not comply with the various non-fracture critical criteria applicable to  fasteners in Section 5.1 must be classified fracture critical.   A286 steel, Inconel 718, MP35N alloy or similarly tough and environmentally compatible alloys.  They must also meet items c. through i. of the low risk criteria in Section 5.1.12.3. In addition,  fasteners less than 3/16 inch (0.48 cm.) diameter should generally be avoided for a fracture  critical application. If use is unavoidable, specific fracture control methodology must be  coordinated with the RFCA.   assessed for safe life. Preload and its effect on flaws and cyclic stresses must be considered in  the safe life assessment. All safe life fasteners must be inspected by an acceptable NDE  technique or must be proof tested to screen for flaws. Safe life analysis must assume a flaw in  the thread root of a size consistent with NDE sensitivity or proof test level. Acceptable NDE flaw  sizes are given in the NASGRO\uf0d2 manual (Reference 19).   for shear loading where bending stresses are present must also be assessed for safe life and  examined for crack-like flaws.     Pins, tangs, and/or lock wire used for assurance against fastener back-off, nuts, threaded  inserts, and any similar fastener parts must be of high quality when used in a fracture critical  fastener application. These items are not classified as fracture critical and are exempt from  fracture control, but it is required that high quality aerospace hardware be used with  commensurate specifications and installation procedures.  nserts used in conjunction with fracture critical fasteners must be proof load tested to a  minimum factor of 1.2 after installation. This would include, for example, inserts bonded or  potted into composite and sandwich structures as well as inserts installed into aluminum  structures. Note that composite structures require additional considerations as given in Section  5.2.4. Because of the unique materials, loading conditions, configurations, sizes, and/or stress  distributions, a safe life analysis of inserts is not feasible. Installation of fracture critical  fasteners that rely on preload for structural performance, such as joint stability, control of fatigue  stress range, etc., must employ appropriate proven methods to accurately apply required  preloads.   that will keep them isolated from other fasteners. The methodology given in NSTS 08307  should be used in calculating the preload in a fracture critical fastener.   techniques of containment and fail safe assessment, use of threshold strain levels for damage  tolerance, verification of structural integrity through analysis and testing, manufacturing process  controls, and nondestructive inspection.

Given that  a proof test must be done, option \u201c1\u201d below is the more efficient fracture control approach. A  sandwich structure composed of metal parts bonded together is considered to be a bonded  structure.  he payload designer/manufacturer must use only manufacturing processes and controls  (coupon tests, sampling techniques, etc.) that are demonstrated to be reliable and consistent  with established aerospace industry practices for composite/bonded structures. Supporting  data must be available to verify that as-built flight articles satisfy design and analysis  assumptions, models, and all technical requirements. Test articles must be designed and  fabricated to the same requirements, drawings, and specifications as the flight article.  fracture control screening criteria listed in Section 5.1.7) must be shown to meet fracture control  requirements by one of the following methods:   1. A proof test (static or dynamic) to no less than 120 percent of the limit load. The proof  test must be conducted on the flight article. The test may be accomplished at the component or  subassembly level if the loads on the test article duplicate those that would be seen in a fully  assembled test article. Caution should be exercised when testing the flight article to 1.20 to  prevent detrimental yielding to the metallic fittings and fasteners in the flight assembly and  damage to the composite. Test loads on the composite should not exceed 80 percent of  ultimate A basis strength.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   service lives. These tests must be conducted on full-scale, flight-like elements of critical  components and samples with controlled flaws or damage. The size and shape of the flaws or  damage must correspond to the detection capability of the NDE to be imposed on the flight part.  The type of flaws and damage considered must be representative of that which could occur on  the flight part.  n particular cases where the above requirements cannot be met, flight hardware may be  approved for fracture control based on special considerations. These special considerations  include a formal quality control program and demonstrated past experience. Specifically, it must  be shown that the manufacturer of the composite article has a successful history of building a  similar design, certified and controlled process specifications are used, personnel are properly  trained and certified, and proposed nondestructive testing techniques are adequate to validate  the quality and integrity of the hardware. This information must be provided to the PSRP and  documented in the fracture control summary report. The RFCA must approve use of this option.  or all fracture-critical composite/bonded components, procedures to prevent damage resulting  from handling or final assembly must be addressed in the fracture control plan and approved by  the RFCA.     pressures, must be analyzed for degradation from static fatigue. This analysis must include an  evaluation of flaw growth under the conditions of limit stresses and actual environments. Since  moisture contributes to flaw growth in glass, flaw growth calculations will be based on average  flaw growth properties derived for 100 percent moisture. The life prediction will be based on KIc  nominal minus 3-sigma. Also, a factor on stress as given in the Table I below should be used in  the safe life analysis, especially for short lives. This stress factor (in addition to the required  service life factor of 4) is necessary due to the extreme flaw growth velocity sensitivity to small  variations in the stress intensity. The stress factor may be conservatively set to 1.4 for all  analysis lives (as in NASA-STD 5003).

The proof test will be conducted in an  environment that does not promote flaw growth. Proof stress will be based on KIc nominal plus  1-sigma. If stresses are low with respect to test-verified allowables and a factor of safety of 5 or  greater can be shown, a proof test is not required. The appropriate analysis should be  submitted in lieu of test results.            Visual inspection at 10X magnification and lighting at right angles to critical flaw orientations  should be done post proof for fracture critical glass. It is prudent to also do this inspection prior  to proof to preclude losing an expensive piece of hardware during proof. A visual inspection  should be done even if a proof test is not required.  f approved by the RFCA, small glass parts may be accepted for flight based on preflight  vibration environmental testing that is shown to encompass the launch loads, provided that the  part also passes visual (10X) or functional test that verify the glass integrity. These items may  include lamps, small scopes, visual aids, displays, mirrors, etc. This hardware is safe life by  test. In the absence of such a test (or normal safe life assessment), glass in a habitable volume  must be contained and verifiable as unbroken prior to crew exposure.  he reader is also referred to SSP 30560 for a discussion on glass fracture control for space  station. In addition, the NASGRO\uf0d2 manual has a Section on flaw growth of glass along with  material properties including mean and standard deviations on fracture toughness for various  glass materials.   for performing a function where failure to perform the function would result in a catastrophic  hazard, or a tool/mechanism whose failure during use would, in itself, result in a catastrophic  hazard, must be classified fracture critical. This classification includes safety critical tethers.  Structural parts of fracture critical tools and mechanisms must be treated in the same general  manner as structure, including classification as low risk fracture parts where appropriate.   of mechanisms are not subjected to large numbers of high stress cycles which would tend to  grow small flaws. In these cases, it is only necessary to assure that tools and working parts of  fracture critical mechanisms are of good quality and capable of responding to maximum applied  loads during use without failure via normal strength analysis. Fatigue rated springs should be  used for fracture critical spring application when large numbers of spring cycles are required.  This quality option, which does not require safe life analysis, must be coordinated with the  RFCA. These mechanism parts would be classified safe life/quality option.   that defects, which could cause failure during use, are not present. Fracture critical tools/  mechanisms must, as applicable, also be assessed for compliance with the requirements of  Sections 5.1.1 or 5.1.2 during launch and landing.   fracture critical and assured acceptable by compliance with fracture control procedures for  pressure vessels or hazardous fluid containers.  5.2.8 Sealed Containers.

Such containers  must be treated and certified the same as pressure vessels when the contained fluid has a delta  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005         NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  pressure greater than one atmosphere. When approved by the RFCA, an optional approach  may be used for metallic or non-metallic containers (including those with a differential pressure  of less than one atmosphere). Containers using this optional approach must have a minimum  safety factor of 2.5 times MDP and must meet the fracture control requirements for pressurized  components given in 5.2.1. When a proof test to a minimum factor of 1.5 is impractical, safe life  must be assured by appropriate NDE applications and flaw growth analysis.

Typically, these enclosures must be shown to be safe  life designs against burst.  t is important to note that a habitable module, for which the CFS is a through flaw of length at  least 10t, is not classified as NHLBB, because pressure must be maintained. The continued  pressure cycling due to the \u201cmake up\u201d air can grow the crack, so the module will require safe life  classification and post proof inspection. Even in cases where NHLBB cannot be achieved, LBB  is the preferred design practice, because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without  rupture is inherently safer than one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for  components that will have safe life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.   hose parts/components identified as fracture critical must be shown to be safe life (safe life  and damage tolerant are synonymous and interchangeable) by analysis or test. The safe life  demonstration is based on an initial flaw size that could be present in the part. This flaw size is  established by nondestructive evaluation (NDE) or by proof testing. Analysis or test must  consider all significant loadings, both cyclic and sustained, that the part will experience during  ground and flight phases. Loads from these phases must be considered for each mission the  hardware will be flown. The total of all significant loading events and environments comprise  one service life (see definitions for safe life, service life, and service life factor). Safe life parts  must be shown to have a service life factor of at least four (4). If four is not achieved, the part  should be redesigned or a more sensitive inspection technique employed. Special inspection  techniques must be approved by the RFCA (see Section 6.3.1). If feasible, the life requirement  can be reduced (limited life) and the part replaced or reinspected when available life is used. If  \u201climited life\u201d parts are to be employed, project management must be informed, and it must be  determined whether replacement of the part or reverification of safe life is feasible, e.g., the part  must be accessible.     critical area and orientation for that part. The size of the flaw must be based on either the  appropriate NDE techniques (6.3.1) or on proof testing (6.3.2). Appendix F, Table F-I (or F-II),  lists flaw sizes representative of the capabilities of commonly used NDE techniques for  geometries shown in Figure F-1. For surface cracks in components including pressure vessels,  both sets of values for \u201ca\u201d and \u201cc\u201d given in Table F-I (or F-II) must be considered. (Note: When  NASA-STD-5009 is released, it should replace Appendix F).     To show that an NDE-inspected part meets safe life requirements, the analyst should select the  appropriate inspection technique from Table F-I (or F-II) and use the listed minimum initial flaw  sizes in analyses to show that the part will survive at least four service lives.  ontributions to crack growth (life), such as environmental effects and material orientation must  be included in the analysis.

The analyst is encouraged to  study the user\u2019s manual, which provides a good overview of safe life analysis.  6.1.1 Safe Life Analysis Involving Holes. For components where it is necessary to  consider the propagation of a crack into a hole, or from one hole to another hole, analysis must  assume that the crack is not arrested or retarded by the hole but continues on past the hole.  The hole must be treated as a crack.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     1. KEAC is often denoted KIscc in the literature.

General considerations and comments on the effects of service environment,  product form, material orientation, and material processing on fracture properties are discussed  below.   selection is to consider whether or not fracture properties are available for the material.  Generating fracture data can be costly in terms of time and money; so, given the choice  between two equally suitable materials, consideration should be given to whether or not fracture  properties are available. Conversely, selection of a material should not be made simply  because fracture properties are available. Clearly, material selection must be made on the  basis of the suitability of the material for the application \u2013 just because a material is in the  fracture database doesn\u2019t mean that it is necessarily the best material to use.                                     A general screening criterion for materials selection is to select a material with a plane strain  fracture toughness to yield strength ratio greater than 0.33 \uf0d6in (KIc/Fty > 0.33 \uf0d6in). While this is  not a mandatory requirement for all fracture critical parts, it is a good practice for material  selection. This is a requirement, however, for materials in parts that are to be classified as low  risk (see Section 5.1.12) and fasteners to be classified as low mass (see Section 5.1.1).  Another general point to consider is that toughness tends to decrease with increase in strength  and tends to increase with an increase in ductility. Both strength and ductility parameters are  important and must be considered together. For example, for a given material, a process that  results in a higher strength, but lower ductility may result in a lower toughness, depending on  the extent of the loss of ductility. Although not an explicit fracture control requirement, a good  general practice is to maintain a minimum of 3% elongation (in 4 or 5 diameters gage length) in  the service environment. Factors affecting ductility include temperature, material orientation and  environmental exposure. With respect to temperature, particular attention should be given to  the ductile-to-brittle transition temperatures for materials (particularly high strength steels) to  ensure operational environments do not fall below the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature for  the material. With respect to material orientation, some materials may have adequate ductility  in primary orientations and have significantly less ductility in the short-transverse (through  thickness) orientation. This is particularly noticeable in aluminum structures machined from  thick plate product. Reductions in ductility in the short-transverse direction may be as high as  70%. As a general guideline, in components fabricated from aluminum plate products greater  than three (3) inches in thickness, S-T material properties should be verified if material property  data for the S-T orientation are not available. With respect to environmental exposure, other  potential causes of low ductility to be considered are environmental embrittlement such as  hydrogen exposure in service or due to plating operations, liquid metal embrittlement, and  exposure to corrosive environments.  6.1.2.1.2 Service Environment. Environmental factors such as temperature and exposure  to harmful media can affect fracture properties. Clearly, material properties that are compatible  with the operating environment are necessary for accurate analysis. Literature reviews,  handbooks, test data and experience can be used to evaluate material susceptibility in specific  environments. With respect to environmental exposure, a general requirement is the use of  materials with a high resistance to stress corrosion cracking, as defined in MSFC-STD-3029 or  MSFC-HDBK-527/JSC 09604. A material not rated with a high resistance to stress corrosion  cracking requires an approved Materials Usage Agreement (MUA). MUA(s), if required, must  document the suitability of the alloy for the specific application and must be included in the  FCSR. For payloads approved by the PSRP a copy of the MUA(s) must also be attached to the  appropriate hazard report. MUA(s) must be processed using the forms cited in the applicable  documents.  environments and should not be used as a blanket measure of material performance in all  environments. Materials must be assessed for specific environmental exposure such as  hydrogen embrittlement, liquid metal embrittlement, NaCl environments, environmental gases,  corrosive media, compatibility with contained fluids, and any environment where related  problems could result in a catastrophic hazard. Also note that data in MSFC-STD-3029 is  based on performance of smooth or notched test samples. Test data on stress intensity  thresholds for environment assisted cracking (KEAC) are not provided. Fracture properties that  are relevant (or conservative) to the service environment must be used. Plans to address  material performance in specific environments should be addressed in the fracture control plan.   NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  The effects of service temperature on fracture toughness as well as crack growth rate properties  should also be considered. Excursions from the service temperature as well as the sustained  operating temperature can affect fracture performance of the material and should be factored  into the characterization of the material as needed. For example, an aluminum part that  nominally operates at room temperature but experiences brief but periodic service cycles at  temperatures near the aging temperature of the material can experience significant degradation  of fracture properties during its service life.   form. Plate, sheet, forgings, extrusions, and castings for the same alloy will generally exhibit  enough variation in properties to warrant data for each product form. In general, castings will  exhibit lower properties and more variability than wrought material and need to be carefully  considered. Plate material can also exhibit variability in toughness with product thickness and  location within the thickness. This can be influenced metallurgically by factors such as through  hardenability in steels, and the effectiveness of cold working in aluminums. Variability with  thickness is also associated with the degree of constraint at the crack front. Therefore, care  should be taken to ensure that specimens used to determine toughness for a given plate  thickness are representative of the plate thickness of the raw stock used to manufacture the  hardware, the location within the thickness for thick plate products, and are representative (or  conservative) with respect to the constraint conditions present in the hardware. For example, if  a thin structural membrane is machined from the center of a thick plate, then fracture properties  for specimens machined from the center of thick plate product should be used in the analysis.   omposite and nonmetallic materials must also be screened for fracture control. Fracture  critical parts constructed of composites, nonmetallics, metal matrix materials, ceramic matrix  materials, honeycomb structures, polymers, glass, plastics, etc., require disposition and  analysis. Typically, fracture control assessment of components constructed of these  components requires empirical approaches; commonly in the form of residual life testing that  demonstrates tolerance to defects.  are used in fracture critical parts requiring safe-life analysis. These properties should be  representative of the process and geometry used in the hardware.  6.1.2.1.4 Material Orientation. Fracture properties can vary with grain orientation,  depending on the degree of anisotropy in the material. In general, for thin plate products, T-L  properties (specimen loaded in the transverse direction with the crack growing in the  longitudinal direction) will be the lowest. However, off axis properties, such as those at 45  degrees to the rolling direction, sometimes exhibit the lowest fracture toughness. This should  be evaluated in materials where anisotropic behavior is noted. In thick plate products, S-T  properties are generally the lowest. This is particularly true in thick plate aluminum. As a  general rule, in components fabricated from aluminum plate products greater than 3 inches in  thickness, S-T material properties should be verified if material property data for the S-T  orientation are not available. Properties of the weakest material orientation should be used in  the life and strength analysis unless material orientation is fully traceable throughout the design  and manufacturing process.   and strength properties. Within a given alloy many processing factors can directly affect  mechanical behavior. Heat treatment, cold working, and plating are common influences. For  example, 7075 aluminum, heat treated in the T6 condition has a low resistance to stress     NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  corrosion cracking; whereas, if it is heat treated to the T73 condition it has a high resistance to  stress corrosion cracking, resulting in large differences in the critical fracture toughness  threshold for environment assisted cracking (KEAC) values for the materials. Similarly, fracture  toughness of precipitation-hardened stainless steels varies significantly with the temper  condition. It is important to ensure that fracture data is matched to the material process  condition of the alloy.     critical parts, the assumed fracture toughness values for predicting crack instability should be  average or typical values. More conservative values may be used. Fracture properties should  be obtained from NASGRO\uf0d2. Use of properties outside the NASGRO\uf0d2 database should be  coordinated with the RFCA. The use of properties outside the NASGRO\uf0d2 database typically  requires supporting test data or literature references.    product form, thickness, and constraint condition. Note that thin parts machined from thick  product forms exhibiting lower toughness and ductility may not provide the assumed Kc  enhancements based on thickness alone. Also, the constraint conditions associated with test  data to determine Kc values may not be consistent with the component. The NASGRO\uf0d2  materials database generally sets Bk, a NASGRO\uf0d2\uf020\uf020fitting parameter, to a value in the range  0.5- 1.0 resulting in significant enhancements to KIc that are not always supported by test data.  Reference 19 (section 2.1.4) cautions against using these enhanced toughness values,  especially in high stress/low cycle fatigue applications. Additionally, the appropriate use of non-  zero Bk values requires understanding of the constraint condition for the crack, which is a  function of stress state and geometry. As a result of these observations, the RFCA for some  NASA Centers such as MSFC and ARC requires that Bk be set to zero in NASGRO\uf0d2 analysis  unless specific data is available to justify a non-zero value.   vessel applications, the lower bound values of KEAC for the relevant fluid and material  combinations must be used in fracture mechanics analysis.    toughness testing of actual representative material may be required for fracture critical parts  whose failure clearly results in a catastrophic occurrence and are fabricated from an alloy  having a wide range of fracture toughness for the particular fabrication and heat treatment  process used. This consideration is necessary since the required service life factor (a minimum  of four) may not envelope materials with wide variations in fracture toughness. As a general  guideline, a wide range in fracture toughness may be defined as material exhibiting a range of  fracture data with values falling below 20% of the average value. In these cases, samples from  material out of the same heat lot or out of remnant material used in fabrication of the part should  be considered for testing. Assessment of components that fall in this category should be  coordinated with the RFCA.       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005    is explicitly required for components with less than 1000 cycle lives when an assumed lower  bound value of fracture toughness results in an inadequate safe life. This provision is required  since safe life parts with analytical lives less than 1000 cycles typically have a significant portion  of their life in the steep crack growth rate portion (Region III) of the crack growth rate curve.  Deviations between typical test data and actual material performance in low cycle count  scenarios might not be conservatively covered by the required service life factor (a minimum of  four). Test data from representative material are needed in these cases to ensure that  appropriate toughness and crack growth parameters are used in the safe life analysis.  Assessment of components that fall in this category should be coordinated with the RFCA.    documented lower bound toughness values and upper bound crack growth parameters. As  noted above, these components typically have a significant portion of their life in the steep crack  growth rate portion (Region III) of the crack growth rate curve. Test data are generally sparse  and scattered in this region and the required service life factor may not conservatively envelope  variations between actual and typical toughness/crack growth parameters.    values must be used to calculate the crack size determined by the proof test. NASA-STD-5003,  Section 4.2.3.1.4.d. recommends that upper bound values be determined by multiplying  average values by 1.2. This may be used as an estimate of the upper bound values for  preliminary evaluation purposes, but more realistic values are required to determine the crack  size screened by proof test. The determination of upper bound values typically requires testing  (or supporting test data in the literature). The toughness values used in the proof test  assessment must also be representative of the constraint conditions in the structure, which are  a function of geometry and stress state. Simulation of constraint conditions in the structure may  be accomplished by adjusting the Bk value in NASGRO\uf0d2 (recall that Bk is set to zero for  standard safe life analysis at MSFC and ARC) or employing more sophisticated stress analysis  tools to match the stress state in the vicinity of the crack. Proof test as a screen for initial flaws  must be coordinated with the RFCA.    calculations for the NDE initial flaw size approach. Average fracture toughness values may be  used in crack growth rate equations that model growth rate approaching instability. Where the  fatigue crack growth data sources are particularly sparse, conservative estimates of the growth  rate must be assumed and documented. All crack growth rate data must correspond to the  actual temperature and chemical environments expected or shown conservative with respect to  the actual environments.  \uf0b7 When calculating life for flaws screened by proof test, an end of service life fracture  toughness value consistent with the toughness value used in determining the flaw screened by  the proof test should be used. Note if the proof test environment is different from the service  environment, that there will likely be differences between the critical toughness value used for  the proof test analysis and the critical toughness value used in the service life analysis.  However, it is important to maintain a consistent methodology for determining toughness. For  example, suppose a pressure vessel will be proof tested at room temperature but will  experience cryogenic service cycles. The test methodology used to determine upper bound  toughness values at room temperature to calculate the flaw screened by a room temperature  proof test should be consistent with the methodology used to determine upper bound toughness  values at the cryogenic service temperature for use in the safe life calculations. In cases where       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  specific data for one temperature is already available, care should be taken that the data is  appropriate for the application and that the corresponding data for the other temperature is  collected in a similar manner. As noted above, average fatigue crack growth rate properties  may be used for crack growth in these calculations provided they correspond to the actual  temperature and chemical environments expected or shown conservative with respect to the  actual environments. Where the fatigue crack growth data sources are particularly sparse,  conservative estimates of the growth rate must be assumed and documented.    provided in Section 6.4. Note that disposition of known cracks should be coordinated with the  RFCA.  \uf0b7  NASGRO\uf0d2 models for crack growth rate and fracture may vary from version to    version and may also vary from equations published in the literature. As such, the material  parameters (C, n, p, q, etc.) also vary and are not generally interchangeable. Modification of  NASGRO\uf0d2 material parameters should be coordinated with the RFCA.      each fracture critical part so that a safe life assessment can be made. The part's load spectrum  should include the load level and the number of cycles or duration for each significant load  during the hardware\u2019s service life. Both cyclic and sustained loads that the part will experience  should be considered. Effects of residual stresses and preloads must be considered. The safe  life assessment is made using this load spectrum and the material properties that correspond to  the environment of each event within the spectrum. The analyst should carefully consider the  part history and planned service when assembling the load spectrum. Typical phases or events  to consider and the types and sources of loads are listed in Table III. Loads from the phases  listed in this Table would be considered, as applicable, for each mission the hardware will be  flown, and for on-orbit loadings for the duration of on-orbit use for ISS payloads. For example, a  multi-mission payload would most likely have only one static strength test. On the other hand,  some payloads or their components may be proof tested, transported, or see significant ground  handling loads between flights. All significant loadings and environments for all missions and  events must be compiled into a service life for the payload or experiment.

Even when these are well defined, one still must determine the load level and  number of cycles for each phase of a mission. Fortunately, help is available in NASGRO\uf0d2 for  building the load spectrum for the shaded portions in Table III. The analyst should see Section  2.2.5.1, Building the Block Cases, and Appendix H, Loading Spectra for Acceptance Vibration  Test of the NASGRO\uf0d2 users manual. Also the analyst will find Appendix E of SSP 52005B  helpful in defining events for assembling load spectra. Appendix D of this document gives the  GSFC equivalent spectrum for the shuttle launch and landing events. The GSFC spectrum is  preferred over the methodology given in Section E.1.1 of SSP 52005B for determining the  number of cycles and their distribution over various load levels for the shuttle launch and  landing events.  1. On-orbit desorption may introduce a loading cycle for composites.  2. Ferry flight in the Shuttle on a Boeing 747 back to KSC following landing at an alternate site.   This landing may be due to an aborted launch or off nominal descent.    fracture mechanics analysis methodologies are not applicable. Safe life testing is also an  acceptable alternative to analyses when the test plan is approved by the RFCA. Safe life  testing must be performed in the operational environment on specimens representative of the  structural design, thickness of the part, and initial defect sizes located at critical locations. If  testing in the operational environment is not feasible, the test level should be adjusted to  account for the effects of the operational environment on the material properties. Tests must  demonstrate the same capabilities as required by analyses.                                                                                                                                                       that preexisting flaws in the hardware are no larger than those assumed as initial flaws in the  safe life analysis. NDE inspections for fracture control must be performed in accordance with  NASA-STD-5009, \u201cNon-Destructive Evaluation Requirements for Fracture Control Programs\u201d.  Inspection sensitivity must be sufficient to screen initial flaws of the size, type, location, and  orientation that are consistent with the safe life analysis. Flaw detection capability for standard  NDE inspection procedures is defined in NASA-STD-5009, (not yet released), and, for  reference, in Appendix F of this handbook. Where conflict may arise, the flaw sizes specified in  NASA-STD-5009 must be used.  ASA-STD-5007 requires that hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance (i.e., not  screening for specific cracks) must receive post proof test NDE at critical welds and other critical  sections. This means that in general all fracture critical welds and other fracture critical parts must  be inspected post proof testing unless the proof test is done to screen for cracks. Exceptions to  this requirement are pressurized lines and fittings, which require that only fracture critical fusion  joints be inspected post proof (Section 5.2.1). Also, pressure vessels of standard design with  smooth membrane and transition areas and that are in the previous experience base require only  that the welds receive post-proof NDE. The NDE approach for other pressure vessels should be  coordinated with the RFCA. For a discussion on the rationale and requirements for post proof  NDE of pressure vessels and habitable modules, see Appendix I.  nspection requirements for fracture control must be determined by the fracture control analyst,  called out on the respective drawings by the project designers, and the actual inspections  certified by quality control.  for standard NDE delineated in NASA-STD-5009, special NDE will be required. The use of  special NDE on fracture critical hardware requires a demonstration of the ability of the operator  and the process to reliably detect the required defect. Testing should be requested by the  program/project immediately upon the identification of a need for special NDE. Cases involving  special NDE should be coordinated with the responsible NDE and quality organization.  Inspectors and the process must be qualified prior to inspection of fracture critical hardware. If  the need has been identified, plans for implementing special NDE should be addressed in the  Fracture Control Plan.   used in safe life assessments without documented rationale and specific approval by the RFCA.  For transparent optical elements such as windows and lenses, visual inspection with 10X or  higher magnification is acceptable for detecting surface and embedded flaws of 0.100 inch  (2.54 mm) length or greater when proper lighting is applied at right angles to the actual flaw  orientation.   f a candidate part (potentially fracture critical) has not been officially classified for fracture  control by the time of drawing sign-off, then appropriate NDE should be required to assure  existence of a baseline NDE status in the event safe life assessment is eventually required.  6.3 Flaw Screening for Fracture Critical Parts. Fracture critical parts must be screened  for flaws by NDE or proof testing. The RFCA approval is required for flaw screening by proof  tests.    NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Sufficient oversight or control of the program must exist to assure that inspections required for  fracture control are accomplished, and are performed in an acceptable manner, i.e., to assure  qualified inspectors, standardized procedures, calibrated test hardware, etc. are used.  6.3.2 Proof Test for Flaw Screening. The use of proof testing to screen a ductile metallic  component for cracks is discouraged. Instead, a fracture control program should rely primarily  on NDE for these materials.    \u201cBoth the crack growth analysis and the proof test flaw screening  logic, if utilized, shall be based on state-of-the-art fracture mechanics  methodology. Use of proof testing as an alternative to NDE to  support safe life determination shall require prior approval of the  RFCA.\u201d    \u201cAll Fracture Critical Parts shall be subjected to NDE or proof testing  to screen internal and external cracks. Prior approval is required from  the RFCA when a proof test is used as the crack-screening  technique. Hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance  (i.e., not screening for specific cracks) shall receive post-proof test  NDE at critical welds and other critical sections.\u201d  fracture mechanics methodology\u201d were levied on this procedure because proof testing can itself  be damaging and lead to early failures of components. For components made from ductile  metals or crack-tolerant composites, sufficiently large preexisting cracks may grow due to the  proof test loading, and yet not be detected nor fail the component during the proof test. When  this occurs, the component can have a lower reliability in service than if no proof test screening  were performed.   o avoid this detrimental loss of reliability due to proof testing, appropriate NDE may be used  before and after the proof test to increase the probability of removing cracked components from  service. Due to this duplication of effort, the proof-test process for ductile materials may not be  cost-effective, and it may be simpler to rely on NDE alone.  integrity, an approach that has been used to ensure the proof test improves component  reliability is to quantify the amount of crack extension that is likely to occur during the proof test,  and conservatively account for this growth in the safe life analysis. This requires defining the  initial flaw size based on the size that is likely to be missed by the initial NDE inspection or that  can be produced by the component manufacturing process.   determined by a suitably conservative experimental testing program, and/or by use of  advanced, non-linear fracture analysis analytical methods. Both approaches must build forward  from estimates of the largest pre-existing flaw size in the component before the proof test. The          experimental method requires use of a component, or a simulated-component specimen that  conservatively models the component material, expected pre-existing flaw, and fracture  constraint conditions around the flaw. The analytical method requires use of advanced, typically  non-linear fracture analysis tools that have been shown to conservatively predict the expected  amounts of crack growth for situations that will accurately model or bound the fracture behavior  of the component during the proof test. Note that some conditions / assumptions, such as  tensile residual stresses and elevated material toughness values, are non-conservative when  applied to proof testing-based demonstrations of structural reliability.  f neither experimental nor advanced analytical evaluations are performed to evaluate crack  growth during the proof test, such that the proof test analysis is based on elementary fracture  mechanics approaches such as are found in many crack analysis programs, then the RFCA  may disallow use of proof testing as a crack screening method for critical hardware due to the  risk of doing more harm than good to the overall component reliability.  hen it is judged that a proof test is appropriate to screen a metallic component or structure for  flaws, a proper environment for the test must be chosen. Ideally, the proof test should occur at  the temperature and in the medium in which the hardware will be used. If this is not feasible, an  environmental correction factor (ECF) must be used as indicated below.  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  he proof factor for the test should not be adjusted below 1.05 unless approved by the RFCA.  Also, close attention should be paid so that basic strength requirements are not violated when  adjusting proof test factors upward. Where proof test are required as part of normal  qualification, the specified proof factor should be used if larger than the proof factor required by  fracture mechanics.    6.4 Detected Cracks in Fracture Critical Hardware. The first option to be considered  when a crack is detected in hardware should be to remove/repair the crack. If removal/repair of  the crack is not feasible, the following is an acceptable basis for analyzing detected cracks.  t is sometimes erroneously assumed that flight hardware may be used with a crack, provided  the crack does not exceed the \u201cminimum flaw size\u201d given in Table F-I, \u201cMinimum Initial Crack  Sizes for Fracture Analysis Based on NDE Method.\u201d Additional analysis work and conservatism  are required to show acceptability of a component with a known crack-like flaw, because now  the situation has changed dramatically from the expected conservatism implicit in the case of an  ASSUMED crack in a worst case position, to the situation of a KNOWN crack in a specific  location and geometry.             required  proof                     toughness   @    test @  operating             NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  A specific, detailed, fracture mechanics analysis (or test) shall be performed to justify  the use of any fracture critical flight part with detected crack-like flaws. Approval of the  RPA must be obtained prior to the use of any fracture-critical flight part containing  detected cracks or crack-like defects. Occurrences of detected crack-like flaws shall  be included in the fracture control summary report along with the basis for  acceptability.\u201d     A specific damage tolerance assessment shall be performed to justify the use of any  fracture critical part with detected cracks. The use of such a fracture critical part must  have prior approval of the RFCA. The analyses and rationale for acceptance of  detected cracks shall be included in the Fracture Control Summary Report. The  assessment shall be made using conservative assumptions regarding the actual  maximum crack size, material properties, and all internal and external loads.  Additional requirements including larger factors on crack size, service life, and/or  fracture than normally used for damage tolerance assessment may be imposed by the  RFCA.\u201d   size, stresses, and material properties and show acceptable life of the component. The  following conservative approaches are recommended:   bound the actual physical size of detected cracks, and any possible non-detected adjacent  cracks and/or crack tip extensions that will add to the effective length of the detected cracks.  The enveloping size to be used should be compatible with the particular NDE method utilized for  the crack detection.  recommended is to add to the detected crack size the size given in Table F-I (Appendix F) for  the particular crack type and NDE method. That is, for a crack detected on the surface  (Fig. 3.a), the analysis length would be taken as the detected length plus the NDE capability. If  no information is available on the depth other than it is not a through crack, the analysis depth  should be taken to be 95 percent of the thickness. If a detected embedded flaw (Fig. 3.b),  cannot be verified as truly embedded, i.e., does not break through to the surface, then it should  be considered as a through crack. If it can be verified only for one surface that it does not break  through, then it should be considered as a surface crack.   or example, if the detected crack is a part through surface crack in a 0.25 inch thick plate, and  penetrant NDE was used to detect a 0.1 inch total length crack, then the analysis must consider  the following bounding crack sizes:       must be determined for the worst-case limit loads expected during the mission (i.e., upper  bound load induced stresses). All additional stresses, such as residual stresses, must also be  appropriately combined in the analysis.  6.4.3 Material Property Conservatisms. The fracture toughness used for the analysis  must be a lower bound fracture toughness, based on available material data. If fewer than  seven values of material toughness data are available, then the lower bound must be taken as  the lower value of the following two cases: (a) the lowest value of all available applicable data,  or (b) the average of the available applicable data divided by the factor 1.20.  he crack growth rate material data used for the analysis of known cracks should be upper  bound. Upper bound data may be estimated by enveloping the growth rate data including the  lower and upper tail regions available in NASGRO\uf0d2. This envelope should be compared with  any other known data points to make certain that it does indeed envelope the data. Several  methods exist for establishing the upper bound growth curve, ranging from statistical +3\uf073  bounding to hand drawn curves. Figure 4 shows an example of a da/dn vs. \uf044K curve with mean  and upper bound curves. The analyst should contact the RFCA and associated materials group  for approval of upper bound properties before analyzing the cracked hardware. In the absence  of any other known data the analyst may use the NASGRO\uf0d2 data as is (average) and apply an  appropriate increase to the service life factor. Because this multiplying factor can range from 2  to beyond five (5) times, the analyst should seek guidance from the RFCA in selecting a final  service life factor. In general, material data will be required for an RFCA to approve use of  cracked hardware.   component has a service life factor of four (4) based on the conservatively bounded crack sizes,  applied stresses, fracture toughness, and upper bound crack growth rate. For especially critical  applications, the RFCA may require a larger service life factor. To protect against cracks near  instability, it is necessary to impose a safety factor to provide margin against limit load fracture.  Therefore, in addition to the service life factor, the analysis also must show a fracture safety  factor of 1.5 as indicated below:  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   Kc = the appropriate lower bound fracture toughness, and  K = the stress intensity at limit load for the crack size computed to exist at the  end of one service life. This \u201cend of one service life\u201d crack size should be  calculated using the initial crack size determined from Figure 3, the upper  bound crack growth rate, and the load spectrum for one service life.

Therefore the load spectrum should be reviewed  for scenarios such as compressive overloads that may result in tensile residual stresses that  could accelerate crack growth. Any potential accelerated crack growth should be accounted for  in the analysis of detected cracks.   of compliance to material standards or engineering requirements stated on the drawing.  Material drawing notes must be explicit and control the product form, condition and heat  treatment of the material. Processes with consequences for fracture control, such as welding,  etching, or plating, must be controlled and documented.   payload, a system must be in place to assure that delivered fracture critical hardware is as  designed and assessed. This program should include sufficient tracking to provide for fracture  control assessment of load changes, modifications or redesigns of fracture critical hardware,  and discrepancy reviews (DR\u2019s), or equivalent, for anomalies that could affect part/component  fracture characteristics and life.

The history should cover the entire life of the part as described in Section 6.1.3. For  multi-mission hardware, the used life of the hardware should be booked against the remaining  life so that assessment of flight readiness from a fracture control point of view can readily be  made between missions.   For example, if it is known with certainty that the hardware is not ahead of the original load  spectrum, then this may be documented with supporting rationale for between flight reviews.   responsible NDE organization. Inspection records should bear the stamp and/or signature of  the inspector. Proof test results should be documented in a report. Engineering drawings and  equipment specifications for fracture-critical parts should contain notes that identify the part as  fracture-critical and specify the appropriate flaw-screening method to be used on the part or raw  material.   short memo for a small, simple program with no fracture critical parts or it may be several  volumes of material for a complex payload with many fracture critical parts. A typical fracture  control program would generally include the following documentation:    8.1 Fracture Control Plan. The fracture control plan describes how fracture control will  be met. In the past there has been a strong tendency to repeat the requirements, e.g., repeat  NASA-STD-5003 for the plan. This is not a plan and is useless for everyone and a waste of  time and money.   good fracture control plan lists all the specific activities that will be done to satisfy fracture  control, e.g., if the structure included a major glass component, the plan would address the  approach that will be used to show an acceptable fracture control process for the glass. If it is  known, the plan should indicate if the glass will be proof tested or designed to a factor of safety  of five and forego the proof test. A fracture control plan should be written early in the program,    \uf0b7 Fracture Control Plan  \uf0b7 Engineering Drawings  \uf0b7 A Fracture Control Summary Report  \uf0b7 Presentation Summarizing the Fracture Control Program  \uf0b7 A Detailed Fracture Control Analysis Report  \uf0b7  \uf0b7 Proof and Safe Life Test Reports  \uf0b7 Load/Use History                      prior to PDR and ideally should be available at a Preliminary Requirements Review (PRR). It is  required that the plan be available early for reviews.

The type of NDE should be specified (eddy current, penetrant, etc.,) along  with a statement that, \u201cno detected cracks are allowed.\u201d Any detected cracks should be  reported for assessment per Section 6.4. As applicable, processing or fabrication requirements  that would affect fracture properties of a fracture critical part in a given application, including  heat treatments, welding requirements, grain or fiber direction, etc., should also be specifically  called out on the part drawing.  8.3 Fracture Control Summary Report (FCSR). To certify fracture control compliance of  a payload, the PD must prepare a fracture control summary report on the total system for review  and approval by the RFCA and the PSRP. It is required for the Phase 3 Safety Review. As a  minimum, the following information must be provided:   and heat treatment used and the basis for part acceptability (i.e., safe- life analysis, test,  acceptable durability, insignificant fatigue loading, etc.). Fracture critical parts that are limited  life must be specifically identified. A statement to the effect that all other parts were examined  and determined to be non-fracture critical must be included.       Reflown fail safe hardware should have verification that any required \u201cbetween mission\u201d  inspections have been done.       8. Copies of MUAs for fracture critical or low risk parts/components and a summary of  DR\u2019s, or equivalent reviews, of anomalies that could affect the performance of fracture critical  parts/components.       information as listed above, a statement to that effect with reference to supporting  documentation must be submitted as the FCSR.       NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Supporting detailed documentation such as drawings, calculations, analyses, data printouts,  inspection plans or records, specifications, certifications, reports, procedures, etc., should not  be submitted as a part of the FCSR, but must be made available for review by the RFCA if  requested.     8.4 Presentation Summarizing The Fracture Control Program. A presentation will have  to be made at various reviews summarizing the fracture control program for review committees  and RFCAs. These detailed presentations should include the following:  1. Introduction and background. Include things that would help the audience understand  you are the PD, hardware maturity, and program constraints. State whether there are fracture-  critical parts or not. Also make clear whether or not there are pressure vessels or fracture  critical rotating equipment present.   a. Diagrams and words  b.

This is especially important if limited life  hardware is involved. The report should track projected use against remaining life for each  fracture critical part at appropriate intervals to demonstrate that the hardware is being operated  within fracture control requirements.    n the event of specialized hardware or applications where the assessments or techniques  delineated in the guidelines in this handbook may not be feasible or effective, or where potential  cost savings are significant while maintaining an acceptable level of fracture control, alternatives  may be proposed. Alternatives must be approved by the responsible fracture control and safety  authorities.   unique NDE approaches, special kinds of flaw screening, flaw retardation, etc., may be  proposed when alternative methods are viable candidates for effective and efficient fracture  control. Alternatives proposed for payloads or ISS hardware must be approved by the RFCA  and the PSRP or the SRP, as applicable, and must be identified on appropriate hazard reports  for formal approval. Approval should be requested by the program/project immediately upon  identification of the need for an alternative procedure.   Appendix A \u2013 Definitions) will be a common occurrence. Some experiments, including  processing or medical investigations and other in-flight tests, often utilize specialized hardware  and applications involving direct contact and manipulation by personnel. Fracture control,  where applicable, can be complex and may require alternatives to, or modifications of  conventional fracture control approaches. Experiments utilizing furnaces, autoclaves,  potentially toxic materials in ampoules and/or cartridges, unique pressurized systems, cryo-  systems, etc., can be special categories of hardware that may need to be assessed for fracture  control on a unique basis. Where feasible, guidelines in this handbook should be implemented  as appropriate. The RFCA, including cognizant Fracture Control Boards and safety  organizations, should be consulted when uncertainty about fracture control exists.   assure safe life rather than the performance of safe life analyses on individual fracture critical  parts may be implemented where feasible and efficient. Such a program utilizes similarity or a  design factor of safety that will assure working stress levels in all fracture critical parts (where  single part failure would be catastrophic) that will not grow flaws that are theoretically  undetected, by standard NDE, to a critical size in four service lives. The required NDE, etc.,  must be identified on drawings and applied to all fracture critical parts. This approach must be  supported by sufficient documented assessment including appropriate stress analyses,  evaluation of the effects of load spectrum and part size on flaw growth potential, and  inspectability of hardware to assure validity of the implementation. Assured safe life can be  sensitive to significant load or frequency increases and must be reverified if such occur.  Assured safe life approaches, when used, must be summarized in the fracture reports.

Hazardous fluids include liquid chemical propellants and highly toxic liquids or gases.  A fluid is also hazardous if its release would create a hazardous environment such as a danger  of fire or explosion, unacceptable dilution of breathing oxygen, an increase of oxygen above  flammability limits, over-pressurization of a compartment, loss of a safety critical system, etc.          Hazardous Fluid Container. Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system)  container, or housing that contains a fluid whose release would cause a catastrophic hazard,  and has stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) with an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa).

Fracture mechanics concept that requires that the critical flaw size  be a through flaw at the MDP and therefore results in a leak rather than catastrophic burst. For  fracture control purposes, other component specific requirements are imposed for a component  to be classified as NHLBB. A vessel that can sustain a leak before rupture is inherently safer  than one that cannot; therefore a LBB vessel design is generally preferred.

NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  Maximum Design Pressure (MDP). The highest pressure defined by maximum relief  pressure, maximum regulator pressure, or maximum temperature. Transient pressures must be  considered. Where pressure regulators, relief devices, and/or a thermal control system (e.g.,  heaters) are used to control pressure, collectively they must be two-fault tolerant from causing  the pressure to exceed the MDP of the system. When determining MDP the maximum  temperature to be experienced during an Orbiter abort to a site without cooling facilities must  also be considered. When designing, analyzing, or testing pressurized hardware, loads other  than pressure that are present should be considered and added to the MDP loads as  appropriate. MDP in this handbook is to be interpreted as including the effects of these  combined loads when the non-pressure loads are significant.     established and standardized inspection techniques that are harmless to hardware, such as  radiography, dye penetrant, ultrasonic, magnetic particle, and eddy current.    on-Hazardous Leak Before Burst (NHLBB). Fracture control concept that requires that the  critical flaw size be a through flaw at MDP and that leak will not cause a catastrophic hazard. In  general, an isolated NHLBB vessel is assumed to leak down to zero pressure without any  further cycling, which assures that the crack cannot subsequently grow to critical size (rupture).  Vessels that can have the pressure cycled or have significant externally applied loads after  developing a leak are not NHLBB. In all NASA payload/experiment fracture control applications,  for a vessel to be classified NHLBB, it is required that the critical flaw at MDP be a through flaw  with a length of at least 10 times the thickness.

Sealed containers generally contain approximately  15 psia internal pressure or less.

All loadings and environments encountered during  this period that will affect crack growth (post crack screening) must be addressed in safe life  analysis and testing.

These  methods used the \u201cPunch\u201d equation from Reference 21. Various formulae have been  developed by investigators to assess containment. Of these, the Punch equation has been  favored for use in containment assessments of enclosed loose parts on payloads and is  supported by a limited amount of test data. The Punch equation is based on data generated to  establish the energy required to \u201cpunch out\u201d various sizes of circular areas in metals with given  thickness and tensile yield strength. Use of penetration equations involves some degree of  subjectivity, but the Punch equation is accepted as conservative. In addition to the container  penetration analysis, it is sometimes necessary to address the fasteners that hold the container  together. The Punch equation application to rotating parts is addressed in Section B.2, to  general parts in Section B.3, and whether or not a fastener analysis is required and some things  to consider in such an analysis are addressed in Section B.4.   of rotating devices often necessitate an evaluation of containment capability of covers, rings,  housings, etc., which surround a rotating part such as a fan, motor, gyroscope, etc. For  extremely high rotational velocities, other additional considerations such as rubbing will likely  need to be considered to help dissipate the energy. The Punch equation may be written as  follows:   V = r\uf077 where: r = outer radius of the rotating part  \uf077 = rotational speed of the rotating part   perimeter length of the predicted impact area and shape to a circle with an equal perimeter  having a diameter D\uf0a2.

A rotating  part, which would not be contained, must be assessed for safe life using a conventional fracture  mechanics approach.  B.2.1 Sample Calculation. A small 2 (two) blade cooling fan has a diameter of 3.06  inches. The fan weighs 0.302 lbs (137 gms) and rotates at 10,000 rpm (1047 rad/sec). The fan  and its housing are made of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy. The blades are 0.07 inch thick and the  housing is 0.1 inch thick. Calculations show that the rotating fan does not possess the energy  level necessary (14,240 ft-lbs) to automatically require proof testing, inspection and safe life  assessment. Because of high rpm, an analysis must be made for containment.

If the analyst is unsure about the need for their inclusion, the RFCA should be  consulted.  B.4 Container Fastener Analysis. As stated earlier, it is sometimes necessary to address  the fasteners that hold the container together. For example, the fasteners that hold the lid on a  box may require analysis to show that they would not break in the event that the lid is impacted  by a loose part. Both rotating and stationary parts should be assessed for the need of this  check.   large contact area whose impact would not be expected to penetrate the walls, but would  nonetheless be a significant dissipation of energy. This check is not required for electronics and  similar boxes using standard packaging designs. So, it is anticipated that the analyst will only  rarely be confronted with situations where this analysis is warranted. The analyst should  coordinate with the RFCA when uncertainty exists for analyzing container fasteners.    a. Does the loose part strike at a single fastener or between fasteners?  b. Does the fastener fail in tension or extrude the fastener head through the wall   c. If a fastener fails, will adjacent fasteners carry the remaining energy?  d. If a fastener(s) fails, will the deflection of the cover remain small enough so that the     simplified method for assessing the tensile capability assuming a loose part impacts directly  upon a single fastener is given below. This is conservative since a loose part is most likely to  strike in an area where the load would be shared among more than one fastener. If the fastener  passes this check, a similar check would be required for extruding the fastener head through the  cover wall. If both these checks are passed, the analysis would generally be considered  complete; otherwise, the analyst must investigate further the type of things listed above.  he approach is to assume that the kinetic energy of the loose part must be absorbed by the  strain energy capability of the fastener. This kinetic energy is readily available from the analysis  completed in Section B.2 or Section B.3 from which the mass and impact velocity are known.  K.E. = Kinetic energy of the loose part (in-lb)  m = Mass of the loose part (lb sec2/in)  V = Impact velocity of the loose part from equation B2 or B4 (in/sec)        .                        NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  An acceptable estimate of the allowable strain energy of a bolt in tension can be calculated  from:   determined from the work already done in Section B.2 or Section B.3. This kinetic energy would  be calculated using equation B8 and compared to the strain energy capability determined from  equation B9 for the weakest fastener holding the container together.            .   \uf03d \uf065  ult   P  ty  P  tu              NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   ASSISTANCE IN DETERMINING NON-HAZARDOUS LEAK BEFORE BURST (NHLBB)  FOR PRESSURE SYSTEM COMPONENTS   System Components. The design safety factor requirements applied to typical pressurized  systems and common materials of construction tend to ensure that the critical flaw size (CFS)  requirements for NHLBB are met under operating conditions. NHLBB is characterized by a  relatively slow leak as opposed to rapid tearing or fragmentary rupture. The NASA fracture  control practices for payloads/experiments require the CFS to be a through flaw of length at  least 10 times the thickness for the component to be NHLBB. Note that this CFS requirement is  a necessary condition for NHLBB, but not a sufficient one. The check sheets in Appendix H  provide all the requirements for a component to be NHLBB.  components can be checked by reference to Figure C-1. Any point above the curve for the OD  (outer diameter) of interest indicates the CFS requirement for NHLBB is met. An assumed flaw  with a length 10 times the membrane thickness (2c = 10t) has been incorporated into the curves  as the basis for this determination. The curves are plotted as the ratio of fracture toughness to  internal pressure versus the ratio of membrane thickness to outer diameter. Note that  consistent units should be used for pressure and toughness. If Figure C-1 indicates CFS  requirements for NHLBB are not met, a more specific fracture mechanics analysis may be  conducted addressing actual component parameters and properties. When the 10t check is  made, the analyst should make sure that any actual through cracks in the hardware will be less  than 10t in length. Otherwise, an actual crack in the hardware may have grown past 10t  potentially leading to an unsafe situation.

The analyst only needs to know the total limit stress  value (low frequency + random + acoustic). The equivalent number of cycles at a percentage of  this limit load is specified by the spectrum. Equivalency is based on \u201cequivalent crack growth\u201d  as would occur in the actual environment. The number of cycles at each stress level for the  combined launch/ascent and landing/ descent conditions is tabulated in the column labeled  \u201cTotal\u201d of Table D-I.

An acceptable part classification process is depicted in Figure  E-1. This Figure is to be used in conjunction with Tables E-I and E-II. Table E-II provides a guide  to part classification along with references to appropriate Sections of the handbook for specific  parts. The results from this process are a classification of each non-exempt part and analyses  supporting non-fracture critical classifications. The classifications are used as a basis for the  fracture control summary list (Section E.4) and the analyses are included in the fracture control  analysis report (Section 8.5).   since it contains all the parts. If not available, the analyst can create a list from the available  drawings and layouts. From this list the analyst removes the exempt parts (or doesn\u2019t put them  on it if creating the list). The remaining non-exempt parts are to be classified and appear on the  fracture control summary list (Section E.4).    nitial screening of the hardware is used to classify all the parts that have a clear and obvious  disposition. Items that are always fracture critical, such as pressure vessels, are identified here.  Items for which structural failure would obviously create (or obviously not create) a catastrophic  hazard are identified as fracture critical (or non-fracture critical). If this discrimination is unclear,  the item moves on to detailed screening. The items identified as non-fracture critical must be  given one of the non-fracture critical classifications (contained, fail safe, etc.) from Table E-II.  The analyst should provide rationale for these \u201cjudgment calls\u201d similar to that done for contained  (CR1) and fail safe (FS1) in Section E.4, Example 1. Sound reasoning must be exercised in  making these classifications since they are subject to challenge at reviews. If the analyst is  unsure about a classification at this point, or a credible challenge can be made, the part is set  aside for detailed screening.                           NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  During initial screening, the analyst is encouraged to consult the project Failure Mode and  Effects Analysis and Critical Items List (FMEA/CIL). This document can provide valuable insight  when judging the outcome of potential failures. The reliability organization for a particular  project generates the FMEA/CIL. A Hazards Analysis can also be useful in the part screening  process.   be documented or reported as such; it is an intermediate step to assist the analyst in tracking  parts that require documented analysis or rationale to support their non-fracture critical  classification or will require a safe life analysis or other assessment as a fracture critical part. In  detailed screening of a part, the analyst would select the most likely non-fracture critical  classification from Table E-II and generate an analysis or documented assessment to support  that classification. This document would be included as part of the fracture control analysis  report and may be in the form of a check sheet (Appendix H), or other appropriate formats of the  analyst\u2019s choosing. If no non-fracture critical classification can be established, the part is  fracture critical.  require a separate analysis to put them there. They are obvious from the initial screening or get  there by default in the detailed screening. Once declared fracture critical, a part is classified per  Table E-II and then requires a documented fracture mechanics analysis or documented  rationale to be included in the fracture control report to show safe life or NHLBB.   f the analyst follows the process described above, the number of fracture critical parts will only  include those that are truly facture critical and will generally result in an efficient fracture control  program. In some instances, it may be more efficient to classify a part fracture critical and put it  under fracture control rather than do the analysis required to show it non-fracture critical. For  example, if a complex structure has fail safe members, and a coupled loads analysis with  individual members removed is required to show fail safe, it is probably more efficient to classify  the parts fracture critical and put them under fracture control.

This appendix provides guidance on deciding what to call the  various types of pressurized hardware (G.2) and a method for calculating the stored energy in a  pressurized container (G.3). The stored energy is required in deciding if the container is a  pressure vessel.    G.2 Pressurized Hardware Definitions. Deciding what label to attach to the various  pressurized hardware that may be under consideration can be very confusing and lead to  misinterpretation of the requirements. Therefore, the following flow chart (Figure G-1) is  provided to assist the analyst in this decision. The definitions (Appendix A) are repeated below  for various pressurized items to make it convenient to the reader for correlation with the flow  chart. Habitable modules are not included here since their discrimination should be readily  apparent.  azardous Fluid Container. Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system)  container, or housing that contains a fluid whose release would cause a catastrophic hazard,  and has stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) with an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa).        ressurized Component. A line, fitting, valve, regulator, etc., that is part of a pressurized  system and intended primarily to sustain a fluid pressure. Any piece of hardware that is not a  pressure vessel but is pressurized via a pressurization system.    ealed Container. Any single, independent (not part of a pressurized system) container,  component, or housing that is sealed to maintain an internal non-hazardous environment and  that has a stored energy of less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) and an internal  pressure of less than 100 psia (689.5 kPa). Sealed containers generally contain approximately  15 psia internal pressure or less.

Requirements  for these classifications are listed numerically in individual tables called check sheets. The  analyst is presented with simple direct statements (the requirements) that he or she responds to  by checking an associated box if true or leaving blank if not true. The sheet indicates which  boxes must be checked to meet low risk or NHLBB requirements. The analyst would fill out one  of these sheets for each part being evaluated. The sheet provides a place for identification of  part description, drawing number, material, and heat treat.  he individual sheets would be included in the fracture control analysis report, perhaps in an  appendix.

The purpose of this Appendix is to provide background and rationale for  deciding when to carry out such post proof NDE. Pre-proof NDE of these items should be done  to prevent major damage during proof. The basis for the discussion is NASA-STD-5007, which  requires that hardware that is proof tested as part of its acceptance receive post-proof test NDE  at critical welds and other critical sections. These discussions do not apply to items that are proof  tested to screen for specific flaws, i.e., utilizing proof test as the flaw screening method.   welds require a clear understanding of project and safety requirements. Post-proof NDE of  welds in pressure vessels or habitable modules can be governed by program requirements for  manned safety or mission assurance involving national assets, which by their status alone may  warrant post-proof NDE. Fracture control is required by NASA to support the safety of all  manned space flight systems, but is not required for general payloads for purposes of mission  assurance. Safety and whether or not post-proof NDE of welds is required depend largely on  the mode of failure as discussed below.   pressure vessel or a module with a LBB design can eventually develop a slow leak if a large  enough flaw is present and enough loading cycles are applied during service. If the fluid is not  hazardous, slow loss of the fluid is not hazardous, the leak unloads the vessel so further crack  growth is not possible, and the critical flaw at MDP is a through flaw of length at least 10 times  the thickness, then such a failure is benign and the vessel can be classified as NHLBB. The  LBB designation is based on an engineering assessment of the vessel design; an NHLBB  fracture control classification is based on the consequences of the leak. An NHLBB classified  vessel does not require post proof NDE based on safety (Reference 29), but it is strongly  recommended that post proof NDE be performed.  f the design is not LBB (fragmentary or abrupt rupture is possible), or a leak of the fluid is a  hazard, or load is maintained on the vessel, then failure would be hazardous and \u201csafe life\u201d  assurance through fracture control methodology is required. These vessels are designated  \u201csafe life\u201d designs and require that welds be inspected post proof.  because a component that can tolerate a through flaw without rupture is inherently safer than  one that cannot. This design practice is encouraged even for components that will have safe  life inspection requirements due to contents or operation.    habitable module, for which the CFS is a through flaw of length at least 10t, is not classified  as NHLBB, because pressure must be maintained. The continued pressure cycling due to the  \u201cmake up\u201d air can grow the crack, so the module will require safe life classification and post  proof inspection.                 that are difficult to predict or account for. This is particularly true for unique \u201cone of a kind\u201d  structures. The proof test enhances the NDE capability to discover problems due to:  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005     fracture critical structure as well as fracture critical portions of the non-welded pressure shell  wall, i.e., the pressure shell base material. Technically, these areas are governed by the same  NHLBB and post-proof NDE requirements as the pressure shell welds. An exception is made  for pressure vessels of standard design with smooth membrane and transition areas and that  are in the previous experience base. These standard design pressure vessels require only that  the welds receive post-proof NDE. The NDE approach for other pressure vessels should be  coordinated with the RFCA. It is recognized that strict implementation of these requirements is  not always programmatically feasible; however, deviations must be approved by the RFCA.  n summary, good engineering practice dictates that all welds in habitable modules and  pressure vessels receive post-proof NDE.   \uf0b7  \uf0b7 Weld repairs, overlaps, intersections, and porosity  \uf0b7 Weld geometry, including peaking and mismatch  \uf0b7  \uf0b7 Workmanship  \uf0b7                  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005    J.1 Dimensions for Fracture Control Analyses. Generally, nominal part dimensions will  suffice for fracture control analyses of payloads. An exception is for detected cracks. Worst-  case dimensions including worst-case positional tolerances are required for analysis of detected  cracks (see Section 6.4.1 for the dimensions to use for the detected crack). In cases of extreme  criticality, it is prudent to exercise caution; therefore in these cases the analyst should  coordinate the dimension used with the RFCA. Actual dimensions that conservatively allow for  the measurement accuracy may always be used. Table J-I below specifies the analysis type  and dimension for fracture control analysis.

This appendix (Reference 1, Section K.7) provides examples and  guidance for interpretation of fracture criticality classification and fracture control implementation  of rotating machinery with kinetic energy less than 14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules).  he Centrifuge Rotor (CR) example described in this appendix has less kinetic energy than  stated above but has significant rotational momentum and fracture critical parts. The parts are  classified fracture critical because they have credible structural failure modes due to crack  propagation that may cause sudden jamming and stoppage of the rotor generating loads that  could result in a catastrophic hazard.   rotating body is computed as  speed in radians per second. Section 5.2.2 on fracture critical rotating machinery states in part:        components for fracture criticality is shown in the Figure K-1 flowchart. If the rotating machinery  kinetic energy exceeds the criteria specified in Section 5.2.2, it is fracture critical unless also  shown to be contained per Section 5.1.2. For rotating machinery with less than this amount of  kinetic energy, a fracture critical component classification requires findings that the:   (136 N-m-s) and presents a catastrophic hazard due to loads generated from a sudden jamming  or stoppage of the rotor that exceeds structural allowable loads, and  he rotor sudden jamming or stoppage loads referenced in item (1) may be estimated as  described in later sections in this appendix. If the sudden stop loads exceed allowables and  generate a catastrophic hazard on the mechanical assembly support structures, carrier, or  vehicle, the mechanical assembly is considered potentially fracture critical. Alternatively, a  conservative assumption may be made that the rotating machinery is potentially fracture critical  if the rotating machinery angular momentum exceeds the 100 pound-foot-seconds (136 N-m-s)  limit without calculation of the rotor sudden stop induced dynamic loads. If the mechanical  assembly is a potentially fracture critical assembly, all assembly parts \u2013 both rotating and non-  rotating, must be assessed for fracture criticality per item (2) above.    A rotating mechanical assembly is fracture critical if it has a kinetic energy of  ). Rotating  14,240 foot-pounds (19,310 Joules) or greater (based on  machinery with lower kinetic energy levels than stated above may have  fracture critical components if structural failure of them due to crack propagation                              t is noted in passing that a sudden stop or jamming event could also initiate from introduction of  external jamming debris between the rotor and adjacent stationary components, or seizure of  rotating mechanisms such as bearings. These hazards, which do not result from propagation of  preexisting cracks that can be redressed through fracture control, are not the focus of this  Appendix. These types of hazards may be addressed by safety procedures such as design for  minimum risk defined in Reference 2, (Section K.7) and discussed briefly in Section K.6.

Usual screening   (Section 5)      NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   applied to all components in a potentially fracture critical rotating mechanical assembly,  including both rotating and non-rotating components, whose structural failure due to crack  propagation could lead to a credible rotor sudden stop event catastrophic hazard.  he structural loads of components in the rotating and non-rotating mechanical assembly  should include normal loads (not rotor sudden stop loads) as applicable for the hardware  service life. These loads are to be utilized for fracture mechanics assessments such as crack  growth safe-life calculations, structural fail-safe evaluations for fracture control, and fatigue life  assessments where needed for low risk classification of parts.  f potentially fracture critical rotating machinery parts are found to present a credible  catastrophic rotor jamming hazard from structural failure due to crack propagation, except as  noted below, they are fracture critical parts and typical requirements for fracture critical  structural components per Section 6, etc. are applicable. Note, however, that if the kinetic  energy classification limit cited in Section 5.2.2 is not exceeded, the associated spin-type proof  test, etc. as specified in Section 5.2.2 may still be used but are not requirements.  otentially fracture critical rotating machinery parts are not fracture critical due to the rotating  condition if they meet any of three criteria shown in the flow chart, such as low risk criteria per  Section 5.1.12. They also are not fracture critical if shown to meet fail-safe criteria per Section  5.1.3, with the additional requirement that a credible jamming of the rotating machinery must not  occur due to a failure of any structure or sub components in the fail-safe scenario; an example  is that individual failed fasteners in a group of fasteners that attach a rotor machinery  component by a fail-safe approach must not present a credible risk of jamming the rotor  machinery. Additionally, parts may be non-fracture critical if shown to be contained per Section  5.1.2 in a manner such that they cannot participate in a rotor sudden stoppage event that  generates catastrophic loadings.   arts which are shown to be non-fracture critical still must be fracture controlled for structural  integrity assurance as noted in Section 5.2 and should comply with the intent of fracture control  requirements without imposing further activity beyond conventional aerospace verification and  quality assurance procedures.  from crack propagation are subjected to the usual screening criteria and requirements as  detailed in Section 5 for all the applicable environments throughout the service life.  K.2.3 Angular Momentum and Induced Sudden Stop Loads. As discussed in previous  Sections, in order to complete the determination of hazard criticality due to rotor sudden stop  induced loads on the mechanical rotor assembly support structures, carrier, or vehicle, the  impulsive sudden stop induced loads are needed. (This presumes the analysis needs to go  beyond the simple assessment of whether or not the 100 foot-pound-sec (136 N-m-s) angular  momentum limit criteria are exceeded.)  s shown later in Section K.4 by analysis of simple models, the impulsive loads generated in a  sudden stop are directly proportional to the angular momentum, H, and inversely proportional to  the speed of the sudden stop, t. The angular momentum of a rotating body is computed as          . The maximum angular momentum a rotating body can have and remain non-fracture  critical by the kinetic energy criteria can be determined as shown in the hyperbolic equation (K1)  and plotted in Figure K-2.    ote that low speed rotating machinery may have very large angular momentum and not  exceed these fracture criticality criteria. As shown in Section K.4.2, the torque, T, induced  during a sudden stop into a tangential jamming spring for a rotor supported on a base is  inversely proportional to the time, t, to reach the maximum torque. The equation is:   loads is the time t. As shown in the derivation in Section K.4.2, if the circumferential spring can  be determined for the simplified model analyzed, then the time t is defined. The time is  assumed to be one second for most of the cited examples for ease of calculation and  comparisons, but this value is not a generally applicable number. Loads should be computed  for relevant stop times for the application. It is possible to compute a sudden stop time for some  simple rotor jamming models as shown in Section K.4, but for more complex situations such as  the Centrifuge Rotor example, more involved analyses or tests may be required.   nce the rotor sudden stop loads are determined, they can be compared to allowables for the  rotating machinery support structures, carrier, or vehicle. Note in addition to the dynamic torque  discussed above, dynamic forces may also be generated which have to be assessed.

Three flat steel disk examples spinning at 8,000 RPM and  one at 3,000 RPM are detailed in Table K-I. There are two small 8 inch diameter disks identified  as A and B with thickness of 0.5 inch and 2.0 inch respectively, which have only 8% and 32%,  respectively, of the critical kinetic energy limit value definition for fracture criticality. They  represent possible shrouded or enclosed fans which are non-fracture critical as noted in  Section 5.1.5.  he two large 12 inch diameter disks C and D were selected to describe hardware that just  exceeds the kinetic energy criteria resulting in their classification as fracture critical. Disk C  operating at 8,000 RPM is only 1.25 inch thick, while the slower 3,000 RPM disk D has a  thickness of 9.7 inch. Disks C and D are both fracture critical per Section 5.2.2 and must meet  the spin test and NDE requirements as well as show adequate safe life if they are not contained  per Section 5.1.2. Disk D is also of interest since it provides a physical understanding of the  meaning of the 100 pound-foot-second angular momentum limit criteria cited in Section K.2.1  and shown in Figure K-1.   Centrifuge Rotor (CR), shown in Figure K-3, with details in Table K-I and described more  completely in Section K.5, spins at only 41 RPM, and possesses only 45% of the kinetic energy  limit criteria for fracture criticality. However, it has fracture critical parts because it has a very  large angular momentum and there are credible sudden stop events due to structural or  component failures from crack propagation leading to jamming of the rotor, resulting in  catastrophic loads on the Centrifuge Accommodation Module (CAM) and to the ISS vehicle.  The CR rotor structure is fracture critical as well as attachments holding components which  could jam the rotor.                  here are other events than structural failure which could lead to sudden stop hazard of the CR,  such as introduction of debris that jams the rotor and seizure of bearings as shown in Figure K-10.  These hazards are controlled by special designs to meet safety requirements.    K.3.3 Example Data Plot and Tables. Torques from a rotating body operating at the  kinetic energy limit momentum given by equation (K1) and coming to a sudden stop in one  second are plotted in Figure K-4. The dashed curve is for a constant deceleration torque using  equation (K3). The solid curve is a sudden stop into a circumferential spring from equations (K2)  or (K9). The rotating disk and Centrifuge Rotor examples are also plotted using the model for a  sudden stop into a circumferential spring. The choice of stop time t of one second was for  numerical convenience and is not a generally applicable value.

That sudden stop torque exceeds the allowable torque of 20,500 foot-  pounds at the ISS CAM to Node 2 interface by a large factor, and results in a classification of  the CR structure and other components as fracture critical even though the CR has only 45% of  the kinetic energy limit criteria for fracture critical rotating equipment.  t should be noted, however, the actual loads used to analyze the Centrifuge Rotor hardware  had to be developed from a more complex assessment. The Centrifuge Rotor is supported on  three-dimensional vibration isolation in the ISS on-orbit configuration, which permits all possible  three-dimensional loads to interact with all the rotating body gyroscopic responses. This  situation generates very complex sets of coupled differential equations. To determine the  jamming forces for a spring deceleration a full three-dimensional ADAMS model was required.  These results showed a peak force occurred in only 0.023 seconds and had a magnitude of  47,000 lbs inducing a torque of 243,000 foot-pounds. If the sudden stop time of 0.023 seconds  is used in the simplified one-dimensional model equation (K9) a torque is predicted of only  205,000 foot-pounds and a force of 52,100 lbs. It is clear the simplified models may not be  accurate for complex 3D situations which differ from the simplified ones modeled, and some  caution is required when applying these equations to complex situations.              NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005  K.4 Simplified models of Sudden stop induced Loadings. Two types of base supported  rotor sudden stop event configurations shown in Figure K-5 are analyzed below with simplified  models to determine loads and associated parameters. Although more complex analyses may  be required for applications such as the Centrifuge Rotor described in Section K.3.2, K.3.3, and  K.5, these simplified models are useful where applicable and also help to identify the  fundamental relationships of the related parameters.         a constant deceleration is assumed to act upon the rotor, which is assumed to be rotating at  initial speed   about a supported central axis as shown in Figure K-5(a). This situation may  occur if a constant deceleration force is applied to the outer radius of a rotating body. A ball or  roller bearing seizure may produce this situation if the rolling element binds with the bearing  races, resulting in the bearing rotating on one of the bearing race interfaces. However, bearing  failures of this type have been known to continue to rotate for appreciable time until heating  leads to a complete failure. Therefore, a bearing seizure may not present a catastrophic risk  provided the items identified in the reference on Design for Minimum Risk (Reference 2, Section  K.7) as described in Section K.6 are followed.      f the time involved in a rapid stop is known the torque can be computed from the body angular  momentum and equation (K3). If the sudden stop or deceleration is developed by loading at the  body outer radius R, the associated force F is equal to T/R. The tangential force induces a force  acting on the body center of gravity, with a resulting acceleration in g's equal to the force divided by  the body weight. For the case where a rotating body is presumed to possess a momentum at the  fracture critical kinetic energy limit per equation (K1), and a sudden stop time of one second, the  torque T can be plotted as a function of initial rotational speed in RPM as shown in Figure K-4 by  the dotted line. The number of revolutions required for the body to stop can be determined from:     \uf03d   IT   \uf028         \uf077  d  dt   \uf03d   t  2          t  \uf071  d  dt                    NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   occur if debris or a structural failure causes a rotor jamming event at the rotor outer radius. This  could be from loads transferred into a non-rotating shroud or other grounded body, which can be  simulated as loading a tangential spring at the rotor outer radius as shown in Figure K-5(b).  deceleration, can be computed from the equation for angular motion. It is assumed the body  remains supported at the center of rotation and does not translate. (If the body is free to  translate, such as the Centrifuge Rotor example, additional coupled equations of motion are  involved and this simple model does not apply.) Parameters include the grounded  circumferential spring stiffness k, and the circumferential spring force F due to the body rotation  angle          characteristics, the angular momentum, and the spring constant k. The spring may be computed  from the combined stiffness of rotor structures reacting the circumferential force plus stiffness of  any jamming debris and stiffness of the surrounding structure to ground. Alternatively, if the  sudden stop time to the peak load t is known, the associated parameter b and spring stiffness k  can be computed. The rotation at the time of maximum torque is    momentum and inversely proportional to the sudden stop time t to reach maximum torque. The  peak torque for this model of sudden stop acting into a spring is a factor of  value for the constant torque deceleration example.                  \uf071  2    d  \uf077  dt      \uf03d                   \uf071  2          \uf071  2     \uf028  0\uf077\uf03d                 \uf028  \uf077\uf02d\uf03d\uf0f7  I   )t(d  \uf071  2    \uf03d                     \uf029b/0\uf077  \uf028                  NASA-HDBK-5010 w/Change 1  MAY 24, 2005   habitat types and provides a selectable, simulated gravity environment for biological specimens  on the Space Station.

This is accomplished through good engineering  practices in the design, analyses, inspection, testing, fabrication and operation of these  systems.  ARC also implements a fracture control program for all space flight hardware used on manned  missions which is designed to meet NASA requirements specified in applicable documents  listed within this plan.  The purpose of fracture control as implemented in this Plan is to define and establish  the procedures to prevent payload hardware structural failure due to the propagation of  flaws, cracks, or crack-like defects in structures of this payload. The prevention of such  failures is specifically mandated by NASA safety requirements to preclude subsequent  catastrophic hazards to the National Safety Transportation System (NSTS),  International Space Station (ISS), and crew.  his document is the Fracture Control Plan for the International Space Station (ISS) Integrated  Habitat Holding Rack No. 1 (HHR #1). The provisions of this Plan shall be met to demonstrate  that the integrated HHR #1 is in compliance with NASA payload fracture control requirements.  subrack payloads and associated flight hardware for HHR #1 meets fracture control  requirements as an integrated structure for the payload mission increment and stage being  analyzed. This assessment scope will address all associated flight hardware, including: unique  integration structure supporting the subrack payloads in the rack, the integrated rack loading,  and the adequacy of the rack design provisions to accommodate the subrack payloads as  integrated into this mission.  This assessment will review the subrack payloads to ensure they meet fracture control  requirements in their integrated rack configuration. However, the subrack payloads are  expected to have independently met fracture control requirements as documented in their  respective Fracture Control Plans and Fracture Control Summary Reports. These reports and  plans will be referenced in the Fracture Control Summary Report for the integrated rack  payload.  fulfillment of these requirements are subject to examination, evaluation, and inspection to the  extent specified by the procuring installation or its designated representatives.

Distillation Assembly Shell   End and Centrifuge pick-up tube resulted in scoring   of Shell End.   Inspection of PCPA Housing indicated an   undocumented repair. The mounting tab, designed   as a machined-in feature, was welded on the   delivered housing.   Peristaltic pump tube failure in FCPA   Contractor-supplied RFTA and MTA tanks were   found to have inadequate welds in the tank shells.   Radiographic inspection revealed several areas of   generally poor fusion in the axial seam weld, as well   as areas of undercutting and several inclusions.   Process (cleaning) accident resulted in non-   repairable damage to one of three WSTA tanks.   Scoring determined to be in low stress area. MRB decision to use as-is.   Interfering tube was removed.   Initial assessment concluded the welded repair was acceptable as-is. PCPA   successfully completed random vibration testing. However, a handling   incident resulted in the failure of the weld. A new mounting tab was fabricated   and re-welded. Weld qual samples indicated strength in excess of parent   material\u2019s published minimums. NASGRO analysis was performed at   direction of Materials Lab personnel to assure safe life.   Determined to be caused by overpressure due to clog of microbial growth   within system. Norprene tube failure allowed unanticipated flow of microbial   sludge into DA and PCPA. Subsequent teardown for clean-up required repeat   of random vibration qualification tests. Re-assessment to account for   additional cycling was performed and indicates sufficient life to tolerate   another iteration of random vibration tests.   The tanks were subsequently rejected and a tank re-design effort was initiated.   The resulting tank is a simplified design that includes improved mounting   provisions and is fabricated from 316L stainless steel.   Due to a lack of spare hardware, the configuration was altered to include two   larger tanks previously used for VRA Flight Experiment. The small tanks of   the earlier configuration and the current large tanks are the same design and   differ only in the length of the tank.

Determined to be caused by buckling of Stationary Bowl inner shell under   vacuum and subsequent interference with rotating components. Post-mortem   inspection of failed ground unit revealed significant de-bonding between   honeycomb core and face sheets. The failed unit was in excess of 10 years old   and had undergone extensive vacuum cycling. Study performed to determine   buckling sensitivity of Stationary Bowl. (SvT Report 621-050-99-006).   Study indicated buckling factor could approach 1.0 when the effect of the   honeycomb core and outer face sheet is removed. However, in the nominal   configuration, the buckling factor under vacuum is no less than 13.2. Based   on the fact that the failed high-time ground unit was the first ever to fail in this   manner, the \u201cone-time-use\u201d VCD DA will use a new Stationary Bowl   manufactured at MSFC, and there are no safety implications to a failure of this   sort, it was determined that the existing honeycomb composite design for the   flight Stationary Bowl is acceptable. Further, vacuum cycle testing was   performed on a similar-to-flight Stationary Bowl and no deformation was   noted.

The AR&C VGS Flight Experiment is made up of three separate assemblies:  the Target, the Electronics, and the Sensor Assemblies. The Target is mounted on the  Spartan Satellite on the Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS). The other two  assemblies are attached to a GAS Canister which is also on the SFSS. The Electronics  Assembly is inside the GAS Can. The basic structure of the Target Assembly consists of  an aluminum isogrid structure covered by an aluminum skin (Figure 1). All parts of the  structure are attached together by means of steel (A-286) screws. The total mass of the  Target does not exceed 35 lb. As shown in Figure 2, the basic structure of the Sensor  Assembly consists of a 1 in. thick aluminum (6061-T6) plate to which the camera and its  support structure attach. These are then covered by a protective close-out-cover. This  box-like assembly is then attached to two aluminum (6061-T6) mounting brackets which  secure the entire assembly to the GAS Canister lid (t=0.625 in.). The total combined  mass of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment Sensor, Electronics Box, and Gas Can lid  does not exceed 100 lb. The AR&C VGS system attached to the SFSS is shown in  Figure 3.   racture control is used to insure that catastrophic failures due to pre-existing flaws do  not occur. The procedure begins by considering all parts and screening out those which  are clearly low-mass, contained/restrained, or fail-safe. Fracture control analysis is then  used on the remaining items to complete the selection of fracture critical parts. Safe life  analysis and non-destructive testing are then performed on these parts to assure that no  failures occur. This report describes the implementation of this procedure for the AR&C  VGS Flight Experiment. The requirements of NASA-STD-5003 are followed.  he AR&C VGS Flight Experiment flew aboard STS-87 in November 1997. This same  hardware will fly again aboard the Space Shuttle in the Orbiter's Cargo Bay. This report  will especially address the fracture assessment for the re-flight of this hardware.              in Figure 4. All parts are assumed to be fracture critical unless shown otherwise. The  parts not determined to be low-mass, contained/restrained, or fail-safe are analyzed using  NASA/FLAGRO to determine if part meets safe-life or low-risk requirements. This  analysis is discussed in Section 3.

Parts which are low-mass or contained/restrained have a  \"LM/CR\" in the disposition column. Parts which were shown to be fail-safe have a \"FS\"  in the disposition column. Parts which are fracture critical are identified with a \"CRIT\".  Three components, the Long Range Reflector, the Short Range Reflector, and the GAS  Canister lid, were classified as low-risk, \u201cLR\u201d. The justification for this assessment and  the compliance with NASA-STD-5003 are shown in the Section 5.2.

The stresses for these analyses were taken from the Stress Report of the  AR&C VGS Flight Experiment (letter ED21(ED25-97-06) rev. A). The frequency of the  VGS Target, Sensor, and Electronics Box will be determined by a low-level sine sweep  prior to random vibration testing. A natural frequency of 200 Hz was assumed for these  analyses. The duration for testing was determined by adding the durations of the  following events: the component random vibration test (180 seconds), the system random  vibration test (180 seconds), and 12 cycles at 100% for the Thermal cycling. This  summation results in 72012 cycles. The loading spectrum for testing was determined  using a Rayleigh Distribution of these cycles based on a worst case loading. The loading  spectrum for flight was taken from the NASA/FLAGRO 2.0 Users\u2019 Guide, pp. 36-37,  \u201cGSFC Launch and Landing Spectrum for STS Payloads\u201d. As required by this Guide, a  multiplication factor of 6 was used on the spectrum duration. Therefore, the total  spectrum for each fracture analysis was made up of 1 test spectrum, one flight spectrum  for the STS-87 mission, and one flight spectrum for the new mission.  his section describes the fracture control analyses which were performed to show that  all structural components of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment met the fracture control  requirements     his section of the Report presents the results of the analyses performed on the fracture  critical components of the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment. It describes also the safe-life  analysis performed for these parts and indicates the type of Non-Destructive Evaluation  (NDE) required. Table 2 summarizes the results of the NASA/FLAGRO analyses. The  analyses are located in the Appendices.  inspection, if four or more fasteners have positive margins with a factor of safety of 2.6,  then the pattern with one fewer fastener will be adequate with a factor of safety of 1.0.  The maintaining of a positive margin using the factor of 1.0 with the loss of one fastener  is the requirement for fail-safe. The Short Range Reflectors and the Long Range  Reflector Retainer Rings are attached by three #10 bolts, and by three #6 bolts,  respectively. The Stress Report indicates that one bolt is sufficient to carry the load,  therefore, these bolts are also fail-safe. All fasteners, therefore, were found to be fail-  safe. The other fail-safe components, by inspection, have redundant load paths.

Prior to re-flight the AR&C VGS Flight Experiment will be inspected. Specifically, all  fracture critical and low-risk fracture components will be inspected to ensure that no  surface damage is evident. It will be verified before re-flight that the structural  redundancy of fail-safe parts, including fasteners, is still intact. At a minimum,  verification will consist of a purposeful, visual inspection for evidence of structural  damage to all fail-safe parts at the lowest level of planned disassembly between missions.  If there is evidence of damage, the affected structure will be repaired or sufficiently  examined to verify intact redundancy.     Only three parts, the Sensor Mounting Bracket, the Target Frame, and the Target Cone,  were found to be fracture critical, and therefore required NDE. All other parts were  found to be low-mass, low-risk, contained/restrained, fail-safe, or otherwise not fracture  critical.

And, prior  to re-flight, it will undergo a purposeful, visual inspection for evidence of  structural damage.   he part has been shown to possess acceptable resistance to crack growth. Part was  analyzed using NASA/FLAGRO with and initial through-flaw of length 0.05 inches. All  stress intensities were below the fatigue threshold. Part was also analyzed using  NASA/FLAGRO with and initial corner-flaw of length 0.025 inches. The flaw did not  grow to failure in 32 mission lifetimes. The analysis is given on the following  pages.
